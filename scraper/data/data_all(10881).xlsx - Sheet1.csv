Fishball has a slight chew to it. It's like eating a real tender rare wagyu beef but it's fishball!

The taupok with fishpaste was the highlight for me. Soaked with the savoury soup, a bite of it is simply a piece of heaven for me.

The noodle wasn't in the best shape as it was bought home instead of eating it at the coffeeshop.

Hands down, probably the best meal I‚Äôve had in Singapore.  We started with the Hamachi Carpaccio that was topped with generous truffles shaving and ikura, drizzled with truffle shoyu - the yellow tail was so fresh and every bite was simply a flavour bomb hit!  Next came the Tanoke Beef Bowl (rib eye).  It was a masterpiece, where the meat just melts in your mouth, so tender, juicy and cooked just right. The creamy yolk from the onsen egg made it the perfect sauce to go with the Niigata rice.  Soooo yumms.

They also do Sake pairing but not much of a drinker‚Ä¶. But definitely a must if you are a sake lover.

They mentioned they serve Nepalese cuisine and it's rare to find such a cuisine that's located in an old heartland estate like Toa Payoh. The restaurant is spacious and the service staff is friendly. Most importantly, they really do have Nepalese cuisine as stated, alongside a variety of Western fare, which many old folks who dine there go for. (Maybe because they have a senior citizen discount special which was really nice!). We had 2 appetizers and a main course and the serving size for the appetizers were family size but we stillanaged to finish it. It's my first time trying Nepalese cuisine and it's actually quite interesting - worth a try really! I would love to try out the Western fare next if I can!

Despite repeated complaints, none of the staff looked sincerely apologetic and merely was in a rush to turn over the table for the second round of diners. Apart from that, the quality of food served tonight was not outstanding, and service was rushed and nobody bothered changing plates or pouring tea till we asked for it. The pomfret appeared to be not cooked well, there was redness and toughness in some part of the meat. It is definitely not a place worth the premium paid for food, service, decoration or anything at all. Atmosphere wise, the place was noisy and warm with spot lights all over and little aircon. It was supposed to be a nice welcoming dinner for our guests but tonight it was nothing short of a disaster with the premium paid for dinner; total damage (bill) being more than 500 dollars.

My family of 6 were not let in to the restaurant when there's clearly an unoccupied table for 6 there. Had to talk to the worker and reason with him as to why he couldn't let us sit at that table. His reason being that table is too close to other tables (safety distancing measures) but all other occupied tables with customers seated are close to each other too. It made no sense and the worker finally let us sit there only when we said that we would like to speak to the manager about this matter. Upon sitting at the table, we were not given the menu after a good 5 minutes and had to approach the waiter to be given the menu. The waiter told us that the order is to be done via scanning a QR code but the QR code slip was not given to us. We were cluelessly finding the QR inside the menu when it was actually a printed QR code slip which is supposed to be given by the waiter. So we had to ask for the menu and also the QR code to be given to us. The food arrived fast but the soup tasted bland. Even the soup with the ""richest"" taste option selected tasted bland. The soup was barely warm too, not hot like a soup that is freshly cooked. The only thing that was nice were the onsen eggs.  Basically an unpleasant experience going there.",0,0,0,0

The beef soup noodles- in the menu pic, the beef portions look ‚Äòsubstantial or decent portions‚Äô but when it came, it only had three skillet pieces!!!  And it was not cheap!!

The dried ‚Äòspring rolls‚Äô were gooey, which I understand that‚Äôs their norm but it was incredibly oily.

Personally the steamed dumplings skin was a bit on the thick side.

Oh yea the deep fried tau sar pau was truly truly oily and the tau sar portions were so pathetic‚Ä¶ and did I say oily ?
As was the deep fried dumplings‚Ä¶. Both had thick portions of skin.

Some lovely dishes that I would go back for more would by the seafood crispy noodles and multi grain fried rice and the xiao long bao. The chunky seafood with its gravy was thoughtfully set aside to prevent the crispy noodles from turning soft too quickly. I like generous chunks of fish squid mushrooms prawns and a dash of leafy green that made this dish a seafood haven. It was well executed without being overly salty. That goes the same for the multi grain brown rice that was well cooked and presented in a stone bowl. Absolutely delicious and very healthy indeed! They have a spread of various types of xiaolong bao but I would recommend the normal flavour that allows you to experience the delicate yet flavorful pork infused with a delicious broth and sealed within the dumpling.  I wasn't too impressed with the lao sao bao which had very little filling making it rather dry;  and the ying yang steamed dumpling that had the skin too thick and the filling devoid of flavour.

We were there on a weekday evening and there were about 5-6 customers ahead of us in the queue. We got to order in about 10 minutes and I'd have to commend the kitchen for delivering at such record speed. After ordering, we waited for about 8 minutes before our orders were ready. The Mushroom Sauce Chicken Chop ($6.50) had a piece of flabby skin that was not charred to extract at least 30% of the fat. It was just cooked and not actually the way I prefer to eat my chicken skin. The piece of chicken, although tender and juicy, had quite a fowl-like odour which reminded me of chicken chops at cook houses. I have no idea how this store used to taste like, but I do not like their style of cooking now. Fries were just tasteless, not salty and blah. The slice of bread although nicely toasted, had the taste of Planta which I hate. The Grilled Salmon ($9) was under seasoned with a strong fishy taste but the doneness was just right. It was soft within and melted in the mouth, not overdone and flaky at all. The worst of the lot would have to be the Butter Garlic Lamb Chops ($12). We got a sinewy cut of the meat and the butter garlic compound was an absolute horror. It was made of Planta margarine and dried rosemary..nothing in it had the taste of butter or garlic! All in all, it's great if you miss the taste of 90's style western food at an inflated price. Otherwise, it's just cheap ingredients, canned beans and junk sold at a premium price. I could walk over to the coffeeshop next door and get a chicken chop at $5.

The main chef is from Thailand so please be assured you're getting real authentic Thai food! This stall is located right in J99 coffeeshop together my favourite chicken rice stall... I have been eating chicken rice all along and haven't been able to try this Thai stall until today.

Their menu is very extensive and it all the usual Thai favourites can be found right in their menu. Their price are also super affordable and most of all, it is very very valuable for money. Basil pork goes for 5.50 and it comes with egg. You can also try out their basil prawn which is super good as well. Their prawns are not those small little shrimps as they used medium prawns which are fresh and crunchy.

The aunties here are also super friendly and courteous so don't be afraid to ask for their recommendations if you're a first timer like me. I will be back again to try their other dishes such as phad Thai and Tom yum soup. Hope they will survive in the long run as this stall is quite small and if you don't look around carefully, you might missed their stall as there are quite a nunber of stall in this coffeeshop.",1,1,1,1

Yesterday we ordered all the good stuff I remembered and taste as well as quality wise they are still keeping up their same high level as ever before.

To my favorites belong obviously the roasted chicken, the chicken rice, their sweet and sour pork, baby kaylan with garlic and the mapo eggplant dish. All of which were support delicious. I don't know why we didn't order the bbq chashu as I remember that being fabulous too but I guess we already had more than enough food.

Wee Nam Kee still my favorite.",1,1,1,1
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxa3BDcUl3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,2,"I have to say the food here is super inconsistent.

My first time ordering:
Got their beef donburi with broccoli, salmon Miso soup and mentaiko sauce.
Beef was good as it had flavourful and wasn't too dry. Broccoli we're kinda disappointing as it was just plain broccoli boiled in water and there were only 2 pieces. For the salmon Miso soup, it tasted good without being overly salty. Mentaiko sauce is spicier that your regular mentaiko and somehow the mentaiko is milder.
Overall I enjoyed my meal and this taste better than Yoshinoya if you need comparison. I also like how their portion is slightly larger.

Update: I ordered another 3 more times from them so a total of 4 times on 4 different days.

For my 2nd order I was super impressed. They added more seaweed to their don And the flavours were good. Only sad thing was the onsen egg with the broken yolk. But other than that it was a wonderful meal.

For my 3rd order, it was HORRIBLE, just look at the pictures attached. The rice was just lump together and mushy. How could they actually serve such rice to their customers? The boiled egg though perfectly cooked was just roughly handle, look at the broken egg white. For the protein this time, I got their wagyu flank beef and boy was that a mistake. Tough, flavourless piece of meat with some parts having some black pepper taste. For the price I was charged, I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED with this meal

For my 4th order which was during the week dine-in was allowed, I decided to give them another chance. Let me say I TOTALLY regretted my choice. Rice was AGAIN lumpy and mushy but this time it wasn't that bad only like 1/2 of the rice had this issue. This was during dinner time. What is wrong with them? Can't they even get the basic right anymore? Also I got the SALMON soup which this time apparently didn't contain any SALMON. Instead, was replaced with a small cube of tofu and a lot of kelp.

Hope they can really look into it and be consistent in their execution. My first 2 experience were great but the 3rd one and 4th just left be disappointed. Honestly if that was the first bowl that I had, I would have never chosen to order from them ever again. I don't know if their standards are dropping or if I'm ordering at very bad timings.",0,0,0,0

Food:
More affordable than putien restaurant. Taste decent, like any good standard zhi char stall, but wont say extraordinary. Menu was comprehensive.

Waiting time:
Dabaoed food for Sunday dinner. Placed order at 6.10pm, which i thought was pretty early. But only received the food at 7.10pm and after atleast 5 times of asking to check on my order.

Service:
Understandable that shop is crowded and everyone was busy. But when i keep asking the helpers to check on my order, they always ask the main guy directing the flow, and in the end no reply was given. Went directly to the main guy to ask to check, he didn't even look at the orders he had in hand and told me to come back 15min, and say its cooking already. Went back 10min later to check again, and asked if the dishes even started cooking. And he finally went to take a look and hurried his chefs on my order. Just felt he should be honest about the situation. If the dishes were not cooked, just be truthful. At least we can better estimate our own waiting time and not be a fool standing there and waiting. Also they seem to have another order line which people call in and ordered, and paid when they come to collect. Those orders and those eat in orders seemed to be prioritied compared us who took the effort to walk in and order, and even paid upfront. Really upset about this whole situation.

Those who intend to try the stall can perhaps catch them at the off peak hours, or try calling in to see if u can pre order. All the best.",0,0,0,0

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NFp2SWx3RRAB,A Hot Hideout,4,"After watching the review of a food vlogger we decided to try.

They go by weight and it's not the cheapest.  If you want to really get your money's worth, just take all meat, seafood and mushroom. Forget anything green.

None of the food is labelled so, choosing the meat is just a matter of fatty or lean.

They are very responsive on the telegram chat so just check with them for any queries.

Ideally, start your meal no later than 6.30 pm.  The queue gets out of control towards the night. We stepped in at 6pm and we were eating in less than 15 minutes.

The spice level of ""low"" is equal to ""Wei la"" outside.

The fried potato, is no different from potato chips, nothing really amazing, maybe potato chips are cheaper.

The fried lotus root was interesting. Since we do not find the fried lotus root chips outside easily, it is worth a return trip. Our nitpick is, they just fry the items without seasoning, no Cajun powder no salt n pepper. (OK maybe the dory had salt)  perhaps my expectation were shaped by LokLok and therefore too high.

I would really have preferred if they deep fried then somehow integrated the mala sauce with the fried items, maybe offer a dip. Maybe I am too influenced by loklok.

The scrambled eggs are just scrambled eggs without any seasoning.

Every other item was typical of a Mala shop. Either you agree with the taste or disagree. I agree with the taste.

The green and brown drink is Thai milk tea. The green one seems to be Thai milk tea with jasmine green tea. They are not really strong brew, but worth the $2.50 price tag. Probably one of the cheapest Thai milk tea.

There is a strange smell on the tray, but small matter, just put it away.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaTRTSlh3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Went with my family just before the lockdown and tried their chicken and mutton briyani, and chicken murtabak. Best I ever tried!

The mutton was so tender that it kinds of ""melt in the mouth"". The flavour of the rice was made just right (does not have that overwhelming spice taste). When the mutton, rice and gravy were eaten together, it gave a homely and familar feeling which is satisfying.

The chicken briyani was good as well. The chicken meat was tender and not dry.

The chicken murtabak had a special taste. It was slightly cripsy on the outside and had a slight lingering sweet taste. I like it!

It was an air-conditioned and nice place. The kitchen was properly separated from the dining area so my clothes didn't have that food smell or feel after the meal.

The individual serving size was adequate and will satisfy the general population.

What I have,

Soi Aroy Signature Mixed Platter.
Comes with Moo Ping (pork skewers), Lemongrass Chicken and Grilled Pork Cheeks that are marinated for 24 hours. Once served the staff will torch the pork cheek on the spot to give that smokiness and melt in mouth goodness once you bite on while the lemongrass chicken and mooping are grilled to tender perfection.

Crispy Papaya Salad with deep fried soft shell crab!! This dish was probably the most unique out of all the dishes tried. A unique rendition of the familiar papaya salad that been battered and deep fried till crispy and atop deep fried soft shell crab. Have it together with the tangy and nutty dipping sauce, I'm in heaven.

Crispy Omelette With Crab Meat.
This is another of the stand-out dishes to me.
The fried egg is not only airy and fluffy, but very crispy and not being in any way greasy as well. The added crab meat atop, adds a distinct note of crustacean sweetness to the omelette and the crab meat itself is fresh.

Thai Steamed Seabass with Lime & Chilli.
Ocean fresh Seabass steamed in special lime and chilli sauce topped with SuperThai special sauce. I like you can opt for fish fillet or the entire seabass. Fresh, tender meat paired with the spicy sauce that keeps me eating non stop.

Seafood Tom Yum Soup.
It blew me away with its depth and bold flavours. Sour and spicy which goes perfectly with rice and the seafood is really fresh here.

Claypot Vermicelli with Prawns.
The prawns are fresh and succulent and the vermicelli is bursting with flavour from having absorbed the sauce. Pack a flavourful punch.

Fresh Oyster.
I'm very lucky that I went day they have fresh oyster and is so fresh when you dip with their sauce, you in ocean heaven!

Mango Sticky Rice.
Hard to give this Thai dessert amiss. I love this as it has the perfect firmness and sweetness of the Thai Mango thay went perfectly well with the perfect texture of the glutinous rice and coconut milk. This dessert is highly commendable.

Red Ruby with Coconut Icecream.
Coconut Icecream on top shaved ice, drizzled with sweet red syrup and fresh coconut milk. Topped with red rubies that gives a chewy crunch.

The Thai Iced Tea here is a must DRINK. Not too sweet yet strong enough taste of the tea aroma.

A place worth keep coming back to.

The taro balls would have gotten my thumbs up had the taro's texture been more ""powdery"" and less dense. I should not compare but I always use Crystal Jade's egg tart as benchmark for flaky Chinese egg tarts. Lo Mai Gai is a must order whenever I have dim sum and although the sticky rice was soft enough, the overall dish did not excite. The kopitiam had decent Kopi peng and Teh-C peng.",0,1,0,0

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxN3UzdndRRRAB,The Axe Western ÊñßÂ§¥Â∏Æ,5,"Went on a Monday 9pm, there was only a few people. Ordered the fish & chips which was $7. Here are some of my thoughts.

1) The fish and chips is Battered Fish! Which is not easy to find.

2) Yes the battered was pretty good. Considering that now is H.A. and only can dabao, the fish was still warm and crispy after 15mins. I guess it's because of the dabao box that they used.

3) The tatar sauce has a slightly heavier onion taste, which was good.

4) crinkle cut fries was well seasoned and the mash potatoes goes very nicely w the dish.

The only down side is that the fish is quite thin, they give 2 pieces, but it's really more like a dory fillet cut into half. But I got no issue with it cause it's only $7 :) Will be back again for sure!  Didn't manage to take a picture and drown it down cause it smells too good ü§£",1,1,1,1

Food didn‚Äôt take long to be served. The meat platter consisted of smoked brisket, pork belly and turkey.The sides were garlic mash and fries.

Another dish that I would highly recommend is Stir Fried Sliced Yam - the combination of light crispy batter and a drizzle of sweet sauce was too darn addictive.

The display TV outside is showing my wrong name as well! my guests did not know is my wedding! This is basic knowledge but yet overlooked by your management. I have emailed to your management and was simply ignored. I guess this feedback will be as well ignored!

A year later we went back to complete our meal in the same restaurant, the waitress accidentally spilled hot water onto my feet. No it wasn‚Äôt busy as we are the only table being served by one waitress at that point in time.

The homely atmosphere coupled with the personal service from the owners made it a regular 'go to' restaurant. And of course the food, which is why we keep coming back.

Was happy that they moved to a location inside Science Centre, easier accessibility and quicker drive from home! They've got a bigger space now in a more cordial setting, as opposed to the 'industrial feel' location they were in earlier.

The food doesn't disappoint and spice levels were just about nice on the curries we ordered. Not too overpowering and extremely pleasant on the taste buds. Doesn't give you that heavy masala-ish feeling that makes you feel bloated and heavy. So it was very light on the spices which can pull you through a post-lunch meeting without nodding off!

Service was a tad disappointing, probably new staff that needed a bit of training? The lady owner was around and of course very friendly and hospitable as before. But service in general needed some improvement.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHRQTVpREAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Hi Ichikokudo! Here's my review (Food, Service & Ambience) for my dining experience today:

Food:
Ordered the limited edition Ichi-Mazesoba for a more adventurous palate. Usually would just go for the classic ichikokudo ramen but i wanted to try something different. Totally worth the experience! I loved how the sweetness from the sauce and the tanginess from the vinegar comes together. There is also a variety of texture from the crispy bits and diced onion. Really felt like a party going on in my mouth and it's really worth the try! The best part was the onsen egg, my favourite! It binds all the different elements together and combining it into one. Definitely will be back for this before it runs out!

Service:
The staffs there were really an amazing bunch! Came during the evening time and i will usually expect them to be drained but was otherwise. Welcomed me with great energy, greeted and assisted me generously and politely.

Ambience:
I was seated somewhere near the kitchen and it was nice to hear some chill music playing along. They were pretty soft... which is a bummer because i don't like silent meals but it was nice seeing the people there enjoy their working environment. I must say that most places i've been to, service crews will be just stuck one corner and watching customers as they come and go but for ichikokudo jurong point, the store itself felt alive with the vibrant energy from the staffs. It's pretty calming and enjoyable seeing them love doing what they do and still serve us greatly. It makes my experience here indeed more pleasant!

The sirloin ribs and chicken were made on the same day. Ketchup is also made by myself. The ingredients are fresh and the meat is generous. The new braised pork intestine noodle is also good. The pork intestine tastes very good, but it is a bit salty. It is just right with the light soup noodles. Next time, I want to eat braised pork intestine rice noodles. There are hot and sour noodles. But his spicy food is very spicy. You can order non-spicy or slightly spicy.

Chicken was well seasoned and tasty. It was also grilled to perfection with just the right amount of charring.

The cashier at that time was not attending to any customers but chit chatting with his colleague in the kitchen. To my disappointment he pretended not to hear me. I repeated my order and he completely ignored me! Eventually I walked away without ordering.

Fried rice - for 1 pax and 4.80 the portion was huge that it can feed two pax. However, i have had better tasty fried rice before

Cereal prawn - I think one of the best dish of the 4 dishes I ordered. Expensive but prawns were HUGE and fresh! I couldn't eat the tail part even though it was deep fried. They didn't really deep fry it properly. Not sure if it's like that but I appreciate if I can eat everything when it's deep fried. Cereal was sweet and tasty

Yam ring - I liked it as well!

Scallop and broccoli - disappointing scallops. Tasted rubbery and a lot of ginger. Broccoli was ok.

The first course arrived at 630pm and by 730pm we were only at our 4th course. The remainder of the 4 courses were rushed in the last 30mins and we finished dinner at 845pm. The second sitting started at 8pm and we were also asked to move our table to accommodate more guests. Food was average.

Putien has seasonal menu. Other than the usual White Lor Mee, there's many other new dishes throughout the year. I love how innovative their menu planner is!

As for food wise, we always go for the White Lor Mee, Fried Tenggiri Fish, Shredded Pork with Sesame Bun, Bian Rou Soup etc. It's always sooooo good! My kids love the Fried Tenggiri Fish alot! They are always asking for more! Oh yes, I love how they slice (in cubes) the Tenggiri Fish before they fry it. This makes it easy for kids to consume! Btw they have FREE kids meal. It's a Cabbage rice with Braised beancurd & comes with a refillable barley drink.

However, although the presentation looks decent, but the filling looks not packed unlike most of other, the filling is always fully packed. Also, the main ingredient, turnip are not well cooked and tasted quite bland and dry. Nothing much has put in the filling to justify the price. Definitely will not try again as you easily get a better one anywhere else. Also, the stall holder don‚Äôt even bother to ask if you need to add chilli which is usually asked by all others to avoid any misunderstanding.
Today revisited this outlet and tried the curry chicken noodle. Curry is tasty and chicken is tender. And it comes with several stalk of long bean which are uncooked. Not sure if it meant for human or otherwise.
Generally, while food wise is mostly reasonable but attitudes of the staff taking order is generally rude or at least unfriendly.
Just for those who wish to try to fried kway tew, do not that the stall only serve with chilli and if you want non spicy version, then too bad.",,,,

I never order their other foods except their Malay Nasi Padang. Quite variety of choices, I especially liked their Chicken Merah (red means). With pick another 2 vegetable for a meal, it cost $5.80. Portion are quite big. Could easily feed 2 small eaters.

Foods cost are rising tremendously, I used to buy it at $5 for 1 meat 2 veggies. Reasonable enough they increased 80¬¢ more, as long as they keep their standard well. Hope they not increasing again.

The chicken has a tender, juicy, slightly springy chew, with pleasant meaty sweet savoury flavour, enhanced with a touch of salty sweet savoury nutty notes from the gravy.

The poached chicken is more clean-tasting with a thin gelatinous layer beneath the slippery skin, while the equally popular roasted chicken has a faint smoky aroma and a slightly crisp skin.

The long-grain rice is soft and loose, gently slick but not overly greasy, with lovely grainy savoury sweet flavour. The sliced juicy cucumbers and crisp spring onions lend vegetal sweet flavour.

As requested by owner, purely on personal taste buds and opinion:-

1) ÈáëÈæôÈ∏° (chicken with sotong paste): there was hardly any sotong paste it‚Äôs just deep fried skin with sauce. On previous occasions you could clearly see distinct paste filling. If it were for cost cutting measures, please do so without compromising the dish.

2) Ëè†Ëèú(vegetable): the vegetables tasted tough to the teeth were slightly salty and did not appear as fragrant as before. Overall, was tougher to ingest and can be improved.

3) lobster with boiled rice: the lobster meat appeared dull and stuck to the shell and did not appear as fresh. The soup was slightly fishy to the taste buds.

4) hae chor: the fillings were less crunchy and not as well done, it was previously very well fried and crispy, but on this occasion it was barely so.

5) braised pork bun: the braised pork were tougher to the bite, but overall decent, save for the bigger portions of fatty meat.",,,,

I also ordered assam sotong which was not cleaned properly and there were many ""splinters"", that wasnt enjoyable. The utensils were also VERY oily and smelled like fish and were poorly washed.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NElpUnB3RRAB,Kia Hiang,4,"I shared the Tofu Omelette, Claypot Chicken and Sambal Kang Kong with two others over lunch.
It was just about right, leaning on the side where the portions were a little big. I liked the tofu omelette, it came out smelling of a really hot wok and was cooked just right, perhaps a little overcooked inside. Kang Kong tasted good. Important that the Kang Kong is young and texture not chewy. Now, onto the the restaurant's famous Claypot Chicken - chicken was well cooked through with meat falling off the bones, the cabbage was memorable, just one those good things that came with the claypot dish that completes it. Wish they had some mushrooms in the dish as it would have been complimentary to the chicken. The sauce which all of this sat in, is where I hesitate to say is really anything fantastic. It was a mild savory sauce that felt like watered down mix of Oyster sauce, soy sauce, etc. But I'd still go ahead and recommend this place to others as I think it's a basics no frills food place. Could the food be better? Of course, but its good enough to fix a hungry 3 people on a Saturday.",,,,

That explains extra chewiness and authentic taste of their signature black bean noodle (jjajangmyun).

Though the typical jjajangmyun uses pork, they also serve seafood version, unlike few other rivals, so my mom could finally enjoy it to her heart‚Äôs content.

I was there on the opening week and felt the spicy jjamppong was way too spicy. We provided feedback and hope they have tweaked the spicy formula a bit.

My son who never touches any dish with sauce totally loved the sweet and sour pork. It was softer than other place but easier to chew as a result.

But even with the quality food, it doesn‚Äôt compensate for the poor service and attitude from the staff.

I am not one of those that demand 5-star treatment at a Zi-Char stall but the service there is honestly lack-of or non-existent. I had to stand at the cashier counter, in full view of the servers, for a few minutes to get my check. And that was after I hollered to an auntie to get my bill. And apparently that auntie‚Äôs priority was to get a fish head served first and continue to hang me. The others saw and nobody acknowledged me. Nobody. Ultimately I had waited long enough to almost leave since nobody really bothered to take my money anyways. Even as someone attended to me, there was no apology or thank you. Simple gestures and none was expressed. Maybe I will do better with GrabFood or Food Panda in the future.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXZxVldnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"This restaurant is not the usual ones that you can find in shopping malls as it is actually located inside ITE College Central nearby nanyang polytechnic as well as Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang MRT. It is fairly accessible via buses as well because there is 1 bus stop just outside the campus.

The restaurant serves traditional kind of chinese style cuisine, the ones you will normally find at weddings, zhi char style and etc. On a weekday, they serve mainly the students and teachers at eh ite and during weekends, you can expect to see more members of the public patronising the restaurant. The interior looks very classic and it resembles alot like the traditional chine restaurant where I attended wedding as a small kid in the 90's era.

Food wise, nothing to should about. I think it's really pretty decent and average. The prices are definitely on the higher side as they are restaurant based. Some of the must try dishes includes perking duck, prawns and claypot tofu. The servers and staff are friendly and will accommodate to what you need. Top up of drinks, refilling of tea were also prompt.

Overall, it's a pretty good experience and I look forward to come back in the near future if I'm craving for perking duck. You can take a walk around the school after the meal as the campus is pretty huge and no students are there during weekends. There is also a sheng siong supermarket nearby so you can shop there before heading home.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbzhLNFB3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!üò∞üò±

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong.",,,,

Food. The standard must order dishes like the ngoh Hiang, braised duck with tofu and orh nee were good and on point. The other dishes like the drunken prawns, trio egg vegetables , I'd probably not want to order them again. Furthermore these aren't traditional teochew dishes.

We ordered the nasi lemak and also the curry puff (3 pieces for 2 dollars). Not bad - crispy skin and tasty generous fillings. Took a photo with a standard rubik cube for size comparison.

The nasi lemak rice is fluffy and fragrant. The fried ikan bilis and peanut is very fresh and crunchy. I like the chicken wing too - crispy on the outside and the batter is very thin so you are still eating the chicken wing and not the batter :p.

The sambal is the sweet type but lacking in omph. That is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",,,,

I judge the whole entity as a failure..well in disguise and in perceiving that the big boss is too arrogant and too flamboyant to the shareholders and only thinks highly of the brand which is not even original in Taste.  Japanese people will tell you this whole set-up is corrupted to a certain extent and there is going to be a dispute soon from logistics down to distribution networks. In fact the NEA is going to task and remove the label from the kitchens of UMISUSHI.

It is located at: Blk 463 Sembawang Drive, Sembawang Riverlodge, #01-01, Singapore 750463. This food store have several branches in Singapore.

I ordered a whole roasted duck as well as 1/2 kg (500 grams) of Char Siew via GrabFood at S$ 40.50 Nett (after using a S$20 Grab Coupon) for my family. When the food arrived and my mum open the packing, she found that the Char Siew is ‚Äúextremely little‚Äù and suspected something is amiss. She then contacted me and I rushed home to attend to the matter.

I then took out my ‚ÄúDigital Weighing Machine‚Äù and found out to my horror that the Char Siew only weigh ‚Äú360 grams‚Äù. I contacted Grab Hotline and was told to file an ‚Äúonline customer service support‚Äù, which I do so later.

As the food shop is nearby my house, I took the whole food package and paid them a visit. The shop staff don‚Äôt seemed to be bothered to my complain and directed me to call their person-in-charge (PIC). After several attempts, the PIC finally answered my phone call.

The food menu has indicated 1/2 Kg (i.e. 500 grams) for the Char Siew and why I am only given 360 grams? This is a shortage around 25%.

At the end, the food shop finally gave me a ‚Äú300 grams of Char Siew‚Äù as a ‚Äúmake up‚Äù after a long wait around 30 minutes.

This case shouldn‚Äôt have happened. It is unknown and remain a question mark whether the food stall staff or the Grab delivery boy has short-changed or taken my ‚ÄúChar Siew‚Äù initially. A lot of time and effort have been wasted on this matter if the related party are sincere doing business ethically.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDRuSVlnEAE,TANOKE,5,"What an enjoyable experience! Sure some kinks here and there, not perfect, but definitely has so much going for it that I wholeheartedly give a 5 star review!!

The manager was warm, attentive, very genuine and friendly. He explained the composition of each dish and also the beginnings of the restaurant as a scale up from the previous gastrobar.

Went there to sample the restaurant week menu.

The yellowtail is to-die-for, one of the best that I've tasted. The cook on the lamb was so good, it was tender and had none of the gamey flavour, although the marination could be improved to impart more flavour.

The sirloin was so good, the marbling so rich that it melted in the mouth and hardly needed any condiments to accompany it.

Desserts probably could be improved further. The s'mores tart was overpowering in it's sweetness, there really wasn't much else going for it. The matcha panna cotta was so much better, and well matched by the tart was of the raspberry jam.

The yuzu sake recommended was spot on and was delightful in its citrusy flavour and subtle sweetness.

This is a restaurant where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Hope to see this restaurant grow from strength to strength, and I will be back to sample again.",,,,

But after 30mins, they still tell me sorry, waiting dor one more dish and I was still patiently waiting until its 45mins. I went to the kitchen there and tell them I've waited for 45mins. And they said sorry but do I still want my order, they are really busy. How can 20mins become 45mins? And they came up a few dishes in 20 mins and a few dishes in 45mins? Just very disappointed.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbHM2VndnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"Ordered ichi-ramen (original) with kaarage (set) and hokkai clam ramen. The soup base felt bland and was not hot. There was an alkaline taste with the noodles. The other ingredients, e.g. bamboo shoots, black fungus, felt cold too. The ""onsen"" egg was a huge disappointment. $4.50 for the add-on Kaarage set was also disappointing as the portion was very small (~abt 3 small pieces).

Hard to get attention of servers to re-fill the iced and hot green tea. The iced green tea was also like room temperature.

Through the dinner, there was also a pestering fly (we were seated at the booth seat area). This was also highlighted in other reviewers' comments.

Felt over-priced for the food and service quality.

-2 stars for the poor food experience.
-1 star for the lacking service.
-1 star for the pestering fly, which we couldn't wait to end the dinner and leave asap.

Definitely will not return.

PS: This might be an one-off incident, and maybe other food options on the menu could be better. Saw some customers ordered donburi dishes and they looked not bad.",,,,

Recommended dishes are:
- roast pork belly/ bbq pork
- XO carrot cake
- signature bbq pork bun with boluo crust
- congee - so smooth and delicious
- HK milk tea - served in an iced tumbler, very creamy and full of flavour
- Cheong fun (rice rolls)
- glutinous chicken rice wrapped in pandan leaf - it‚Äôs a small portion so just nice for one to eat

Ambience and accessibility üïØ‚ôøÔ∏è
Have seen plenty of elderly in wheelchair coming in and restaurant is spacious thus definitely accessible. They will even help to shift the chairs to make way for wheelchair to slot into the table instead. Have baby chairs and also booth seats.

Service is generally pretty attentive and welcoming. Do note the nuts at the start are chargeable so feel free to reject if you like. Wet tissues are also chargeable.

If you have a Citibank card, pay with it and get $10 return voucher with $50 min spend. Weekdays 3-5pm diners can also enjoy 40% off dim sum",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVNDZMbkZBEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Ordered several dishes, if I recall about 6 dishes only. Each time a dish is served, the next takes 15 minutes. That‚Äôs fine, but what is totally disappointing is the lack of quality in our food. The crab was bitter and slimey and the meat was either too salty or underseasoned.

Rather than keep up a facade of a finer dining experience (interior and atmosphere really reminded of a wedding dinner), perhaps they should look into improving the quality of the food instead, just a suggestion.

Avoid: Everything Else",,,,

The supervisor or is it manager I am not sure,keep giving instructions to the waitresses but this particular waitress probably new, keep serving the wrong dishes to the tables and she accidentally knocked over the hot tea at our table which thankfully didn't scalded my dad.After the first round of the 7 dishes(served one time only) second round onwards they just keep forgetting about us. Until I had to asked the manager /supervisor then they serve our dishes out. One of the kitchen server ( she's not in uniform but white t shirt) came out and saw our table is empty and said oh dear I will check for you with the kitchen.One of the fried dishes was cold when my folks bite on it,another dish was the long beans and was already very soggy(""old veg"" not my words,but the supervisor/manager's )  At $46.80++ the menu is not extensive and some of the dishes are not served even though we asked again.

Two persons complemented their meal with a bowl of rice.

As my children were allergic to prawns, the waiter quickly came back to us when he found out the ngoh hiang contained prawn (he thought it only had pork).
My fav was the fish, and my friend (who hadn't been there for  quite a while) particularly liked the fried mee pok (i thought it was unusual too cos it's usu fried mee). The ngoh hiang was crispy and fragrant The yam paste was good (smooth, not cloyingly sweet or oily). Staff were helpful.

Ok. Back to this gem of a stall.

Queues usually start forming at around 0730H, and by around 1030H, they'd be sold out and that's it.

The sambal and sweet sauce combination is like how you'd shower a Muse with, throw in some Harp tunes and you're in Xanadu.

Taupok bursts with so much soup that it puts a good Onde-Onde to shame. It is swimming in a vat of hot soup, waiting to be served.

Fishcake is soft on the inside. Lembek when handled. The skin on the outside is fried, which lends another dimension to the texture. Yes. I do eat fishcakes. I'm weird.

Food was bad and expensive for the portion sizes - vegetarian luo han was nothing more than a pile of canned mushrooms in oyster/soy sauce (?!!!), sheng jian bao skin was tough and doughy, wild steam shoots which was supposed to come with meat was a sad puddle of withered shoots in muddy gravy with not a single strand of meat in sight.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3NINVNBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,3,"I was there with my family for the dinner ala carte buffet. The variety of dishes though not considered extensive, was pretty ok as the dishes were Chinese tzi char type and you won't aim to eat every single one üòÖ

I like it that the serving size is small, but just enough for the number of diners indicated. This allows us to order a particular dish again if we really like it and not to forcefully finish everything if it doesn't suit our taste buds. It also allows us to try out more of their dishes too without getting full just eating a couple.

There were a couple of dishes that I particularly like...eg fried hot fun and the fried fish. The rest were just very average and some coffee shop tzi char stalls have better to offer.

Service wise was slow, except for the first round of one time order dishes, the rest took a long time to be served and certain dishes were never served despite us having to keep checking with the serving staff. Most of the staff were friendly and responsive, with the exception of one who was pretty rude, and wasn't very willing to top up the tea or take any new orders, but was always busy walking around.

Though pricing wise, it may appear to be lower than many other restaurants serving buffets (note that tea and wet tissues are charged separately), overall I doubt I will be back in a long time as food is just average and nothing memorable.",,,,

I had super low expectations but when the whole restaurant was seated, I wondered if the existing Google reviews were harsh. The fried rice was tasteless and the pork chop though nicely fried, was strangely sweet. The pan fried buns/gyoza/xlb all too, tasted weirdly sweet while the drunken chicken. The only thing that was supposed to be sweet - the barley drink, was tasteless. I've eaten local cuisine in Shanghai before and the food doesn't taste this way.

Looking at others assuming they waited long and not happy is your own judgement. $10 for a fried rice I would think is reasonable. Even a zhe char stall fried rice now is about $8. So I do not know what do you meant by expensive.

We can rate the food and service but should not judged what others are doing when we dont even know them..I dont see anything wrong with the lady boss going around greeting..this statement is a bit judgmental. Nothing wrong for her to go around even it is true. I think is not fair to judge just for a visit..think must be fair to rate the food but not judged people and put here online to embarrass her. She is just running a business..

The food here was great. Recommended many of my friends, they all love it. Waiting time was reasonable because of the crowd. We were patient and understand that the chef needs time to prepare and is worth waiting. Looking around, I could see there were many still waiting for their food. They all looked cool and enjoying their drinks. None of the customer showed any sign of impatient. Heard them thanking the lady boss for checking on them if they are being served..I could see there were many regular customers. Is a good sign. Good food is worth waiting. The price is reasonable.

She took the list of order, which clearly stated 1 chicken rice, 1 plain rice, but served us 2 chicken rice instead. I highlighted, she did not even apologize and just exchanged with white rice.

We were preparing to leave and was about to wear our masks, halfway through she asked to clean the table. We kindly requested for her to wait till we stand up, she looked at her colleagues, repeated what we said while rolling her eyes. The reason we requested that was because we had past experiences where food and drinks were spilled onto our clothes during clearing, was it too much to ask since wearing mask was just 10-20 seconds?

However when we ate there recently we were disappointed. The TH milk tea that we usually order tasted diluted. Our favorite garlic pork dish is no longer what it looks and taste. Now it looks like it is not well cooked. No more golden brown and crispness no more. Dont taste good. Dry chicken curry  standard has dropped a lot.  The creaminess and flavour is very flat. The uncle waiter used to be happy and friendly. Now he don't smile at all just Stern face all the time. We highly suspect they have changed the chef. It is just no longer the tasty food that we were used to having. I don't think we will ever come back here again.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0lXclV3EAE,Chirashi Sora,4,"Dinner plans with a couple of friends, and decided to order from different places. So we ordered a Hana Bara (Mini) ($18.80 nett) as a takeaway order, and it took 15 minutes to prepare. Once done, brought over to another place just a couple of minutes away to dine in.

The block of brown in the middle was said to be a sponge cake, from another review, so when we tried...... We were confused, and couldn't really tell. 'Cause there were pieces of tamago with brown tops that looked like the middle piece, that tasted similar but not, you know? But not that big a deal.

Before I go any further, the main reason why this was a 1 star down was just because of the temperature of the sashimi. This is the first time that I have room temperature or un-cold sashimi don, which didn't quite sit well with me. I like my sashimi and sushi cold, you know? It's just the experience and expectation for Japanese cuisine.

Apart from that, everything else was awesome! The portion was huge, totally worth the $18.80, and not just the rice, but the sashimi and ingredients were plentiful! I love the mix of the furikake throughout the don, with the sashimi cubes and mixed into the rice. Everything was flavourful enough that I didn't need to mix the wasabi and soy sauce in.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrblpDTGhRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"Awesome HK style restaurant! Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Service is decent and not overly tight like most restaurants.

Food is very good. Not overly heavy on seasoning as most places and has a very clean taste to let the ingredients speak. Think home cooking with no msg or added salt/sugar...

Har Cheong Gai was perfect! But skip the chili sauce that came with it doesn‚Äôt enhance the dish.

Coffee pork ribs was amazing! Fall of the bone while good crisp outside.

Choy poh home made tofu was yums! The nicely crispy choy poh bits gave great saltiness enhance you rice or noodles to go with the meal.

Samba sweet potato leaves great balance of sambal flavor but not overpowering.

Sam lo hor fun was very ‚Äúclean‚Äù and not overly season. Subtly dish to let the fish and wok hei of noodles shine.

Highly recommended and definitely back again soon!

Truffle hamachi carpaccio looks nice but I couldn‚Äôt taste any truffle from the pieces itself. Their sliders saved the day for me, along with their service. To be honest, I‚Äôve never liked Kabuke and I dragged my feet to Tanoke. While I‚Äôm glad that I finally checked out Tanoke, I felt the food‚Äôs quality was on the same level as that of Kabuke‚Äôs. For the more discerning customer, you might feel slightly short-changed as everything that‚Äôs supposedly fancy on the menu do not deliver at all in terms of quality and taste.

The atmosphere is not great even though they are located in a shopping mall the air con in the restaurant is high and there is no cooling feeling.

Lastly, the service. The service is not great at all, no one attended to the table service and our emptied plates are all piling up at the table and no one is here to clear the plates UNTIL when we are about to left the table.

The dim sum still taste good after all these years. Not mind blowingly good but comfortably adhering to the taste you are used to and familiar with. The selection is somewhat limited and this is understandable due to manpower constraints.

Notably missing were Radish Cake and Lotus Leaf Wrapped Glutinous Rice.

They offer to separate the fried stuff such as luncheon meat, fish and potato (sliced and fried into chips). You won't regret just DO IT. Add a buncha eggs to get them scrambled and watery down onto your bowl. Also preferred the smaller noodles while the sauce dances intensely ard them. Slurp carefully! The Thai milk tea is a must-have. THICK is the word. Add a little bit of water as it's Abit too sweet for me.

First, I was attracted by the menu as I can tell immediately many are Shanghai home kitchen type dishes that only serve in Shanghai street style small restaurants, like curry beef, sticky rice stick.
Here are the comments:
Service - robotic but no real customer attention.
Xiao long bao and Sheng jian bao - not good the meat is too hard, like a meat ball, and not juicy enough.  I don't agree with one review that it is too oily.  First the ""juice"" is not oil, it is pig skin boil long enough to become collagen so if anyone has tiny little common sense will know these bao is good for skin and beauty.  If you think it is oily then you better go eat burger.  Here the XLB skin is so thick and dry.  The SJB is not hot and bottom not crispy, just like toast.  The pork not only hard but with no pork taste.  Very disappointed, and if a restaurant will have signature dish disappointed, I can write off this restaurant.
Curry beef rice vermicelli - surprisingly good and authentic and it gives one star in my overall three stars ranking.
Last, as from photo, I am also very disappointed they put the vinegar on the Xiao long bao, do they respect the food or have any sense of hygiene?
Definitely no need to come again.",,,,

Margarita tasted like pure juice and sour which was a bummer.

As for the food, I think they are missing the best point of having a SW US or Mexican menu:  You only have to stock 10-15 ingredients to make DOZENS of
different southern dishes!!!

My suggestion, and I mean this with best intentions.
Offer plain everything in the menu, then make proteins add-ons.  You are punishing vegetarians by charging full price to remove the meat.  Or even punishing anyone that isn't in the mood for a particular protein.
Adding a surcharge to change proteins is not cool.  2 bucks extra to sub prawn for chicken is kinda crazy.
Go basic + add-ons is my best suggestion.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWJtUUV3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"If I could I would give 2.5 stars.
Rounding up because this place is new and I understand they are finding their footing.

Visited on 8 June
Ordered Pan Fried Bun (4pc $5.80) and Xiao Long Bao (5pc $5.80)
It's nice that the listed price was the price I paid, no GST, no service charge. Not sure if this would change.

Pic: Unfortunately found a hair in the meat filling of the pan fried bun.
Pic: panfried buns as served + vinegar colour
Pic: discolouration on the white base piece of xiao long Bao tray

Vinegar provided was very diluted and ginger strips very very mild. I love my vinegar so if you don't you would not mind.

Pan Fried Bun - bottom is definitely nice-crispy, dough to meat ratio is not that bad. My issue was more how to consume it because I wanted to drip vinegar inside + eat as a whole to enjoy the different textures.
Butbthe filling was quite hot (mine were served fresh&hot, some reviews mentioned lukewarm food) and I didn't want the soup inside to spill out so it was a bit awkward trying to bite the bread part open and cool the inside down. After which it was still slightly too big to stuff the whole thing in my mouth.

I cannot speak for authenticity as I have not been to Shanghai to eat the panfried bun (nor to any part of China unfortunately).

Next, I will compare the xiao long Bao to the OTHER brand I visit (Din..).

BY COMPARISON, this one is cheaper, slightly bigger (I say so because I usually put the whole XLB in my mouth) but like a rougher made cousin, skin is not as thin and tender which speaks of lesser skill from the maker, meat is also less ""exquisite"". For instance, when I bite open Din's XLB, I never see the cooked blood on the filling (that jellyfish, smooth, patchy thing?).

ON ITS OWN, I'm happy to eat it. Would I go back? Not on my own, very unlikely. If my friends wanted to try it, I would go along and be happy/have no complaints, I would take the chance to try another dish probably. Perhaps it's time to research good pan fried bun in SG haha.",,,,

The food is always fresh and tasty, whether it is takeaway set meal or dine-in ala carte dishes.
Was pleasantly surprised that the Thai lady boss cling wrapped the plastic container of green curry that I takeaway and eliminated the common problem of spillage. Strange that other hawkers don't do the same.",,,,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNWFUSUhREAE,Jack's Place,2,"Standard of the place has dropped overall.
1. First they did not serve (or even ask, for that matter) water. It was only after about 20 mins after we asked for water that it was served.
2. Then they forgot to serve us the soup that came with the set meal. After we asked they took awhile to verify with each other whether anyone did serve the soup. Eventually arrived after the main course did.
3. One of us ordered the steak well done, and it was so tough that he had difficulties cutting it with the steak knife.
4. For some reason they were reluctant to clear the table. Many service staff walked past and looked to see if we were done eating, but despite the obvious empty dishes, no one bothered to clear. When they served the coffee and ice cream there was not enough space on the table but yet the staff still tried to put the cups and bowls down without clearing, until we had to ask them to do so. Seriously?
5. The steak was supposed to come with slices of King mushroom. The plural only meant there were two pieces instead of one. And superbly thinly sliced too, at that. Have to admire the skill of the chef.

Will seriously reconsider whether to come back here ever again.",,,,

I visited again last dinner because it was very delicious, the atmosphere was good and the appetizers and soup had particularly delicate tastes so I visited again. As always, delicious appetizer and shark fin soup. Other fish dishes and mapo beans were eaten, but they were too spicy to be honest. People who like spicy foods will surely be delicious. The small basket parcel was delicious, and the dessert mango pudding was delicious with a novel texture. Lunch course is $ 48 per person. It is always recommended for some reason.

Very delicious and good atmosphere and service. We had a fish course, but everything was delicious.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ3FhVFFBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"The mala here is definitely one of the best and cheaper ones I have had.

They offer ingredients that one would normally not find in other mala stalls but still manage to blend them seamlessly into the dish. I would highly recommend the eggs, which they serve scrambled on top of the dish. Another unique point would be how they deep-fry certain ingredients (best of which are the potatoes, lotus root, and fish) which add an extra layer of texture and taste. I find the dry version to be the better style of their mala, but this is not to discount the soup version, which is rather flavourful as well. Though do expect to wait around 15 - 25 minutes, which feels rather acceptable to me considering the level of preparation.

The price is based off the weight of the ingredients, irregardless of whether they are meat or vegetable. Compared to other mala stalls, the price here is considerably cheaper and you can expect to spend around S$8 - 10 per person for a filling portion.

The store has a great ambience as well with a cozy indoor setting and also a cool outdoor seating overlooking a part of the campus. Some seats to wait at is also provided along the corridor to the store which is an added bonus.

I end with their service, which is mainly what prompted me to write this review. The staff there have always been friendly and helpful in all my visits. I would like to highlight a recent visit when they unfortunately made a mistake in the order. As we only noticed later when the store was about to close, we were not able to ask for the missing ingredients. However, my friend was contacted by an employee of the store who was very apologetic and offered a discount off our next order. The responsibility and service shown by the staff through this action definitely reinforced the consistency in their service.

All in all, definitely worth the trip into NTU!",,,,

In a nutshell, the food here is decent. Just skip the desserts and the coffee (which is a collaboration with local Hook coffee but the cafe does not have a barista in house). After lunch, simply hop over to Thus Coffee which is just around the corner.

It‚Äôs nice, quiet and spacious spot for catching up over lunch. On a Monday noon, it wasn‚Äôt crowded at all. We had a nice far end spot where behind the doors is the backyard with a water well.

We ordered the otah bruschetta (sourdough), seafood aglio olio, fishy business (salmon), roffles platter and wild mushroom risotto. All of us rather enjoyed our respective main course.

Thereafter, we shared the ondeh ondeh cake, yuzu cheesecake and a warm apple crumble and also had cups of coffee.

The Apple crumble looked really funky and unnatural (take a look at the last photo) plus it was too sweet. The ondeh ondeh was nothing to rave about either.

.
Founded in 1966 by Jack Hunt and subsequently expanded by Say Lip Hai from 1974 onwards, this old-time casual steakhouse was once ridiculed for selling 'up-market' Western fare in heartland HDB locations.
.
Seniors may well recall those times in the early 1980s, when a set meal here - consisting of a soup, sirloin steak, salad, baked potato, fruit cocktail, and coffee/tea, cost just SGD $5.20..... at a time when a typical meal was less than SGD $2.
.
These days, their steaks remain as good as before, grilled to your requested doneness, served sizzling on a hot plate. The beef ribeye is juicy and tender, with a satisfying light chew, and robust meaty savoury salty flavour.
.
The accompanying boiled vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrot) have bright vegetal sweet flavour, while the soft baked potato with starchy sweet notes has old-school toppings served tableside - rich sour cream, crisp spring onions, chewy bacon bits. Filling.
.
They also specialise in the tenderloin cut, with 1 option being an eye-catching tableside flambe.",,,,

Perhaps they should move the last order time at least 1 hour before closing time or inform the customers about closing time before they make any orders.

In terms of food, the dumplings were not really well prepared compared to usual. You could tell they were left in the cold for awhile before serving and the skin were all stuck to each other.

In comparison to a typical Japanese restaurant, the ramen is slightly thicker. Chicken is incredible. You can simply tear it off with chopsticks since it is so soft.

We ordered our drinks, Kopi ice and Teh ice, and were surprisingly pleased by it. They were perfect, unlike what the other reviews might imply. Here's a tip : If the drink has bubbles on top, it's probably good :)

My partner had her Mozz.Cheese prata and it was jampackedddd with cheese, better than any other places I can think of in Singapore. Curry was thick but not spicy, so I guess there's a negative there.

So far, if my experience had ended here, I'd give this place a 5/5. Then I had a bite of my paper thosai.

Thosai was crispy, but only because the thin parts were burnt and bitter! Thicker areas as so thick because the batter was scrapped off. The mouth feel was practically too chewy like gum or too crumbly like sand!

To make it worse, the dhaal and chutney was especially thin and flavourless. Spent so much time scrapping the bottom to pick up more bits within the watery gravy, I felt like I was fishing üé£üé£üé£üé£ üêüüêüüêü

In spite of this, I admit lah, maybe their batter wasn't good that day or they had a bad day in the kitchen. Still, to this day, the worst thosai I've had and I've had a lott of thosai. My tastebuds were disappointed and hurt, even their plaster prata cannot cover my disappointment.

Visited yesterday and was stunned by the drastic drop in standards.
The salmon sashimi was literally pink like it's dried for a while .  My company thought it was weird for me to recommend genki since he boycotted for a while due to low standards.  And after seeing the salmon I just couldn't bring myself to send in the rest of the orders.

They also got our orders wrong.
It wasn't busy yet it happened.  So I have no idea what's happening in the kitchen .

After month of renovation, the restaurant was finally opened. After 1-2 weeks of opening, I went to try their food and was quite disappointed with the system. Even though there were 4-5 people in the kitchen, I observed that many orders were delayed and given wrongly to other customers. Thankfully, mine was not. However, I observed that the supervisor (who was also the supervisor of the previous shop there) was very demanding with the workers though they were trying hard. His constant nagging didn't help. The food is over priced weighed with the quality given. For a mutton meal, the shop worker asked whether I wanted papadam and I said okay. In a typical Indian food store (even in restaurants), papadam is not charged but here I was $1, I only got to know it when I looked at the receipt on my way back. If it is charged, they should at least tell. The rice meal was bland.

However, the staff on the phone kept insisting and being so pushy with me by telling me that I should come earlier because the last order was at 930pm. Not only that, they do not respect my boundaries as they wanted to confirm my table by spam calling me 5 times while i am at work.

Then, managed to get everyone to come earlier and the waitress was so pushy towards the items we want to order by saying we should get abalone dishes. However, not everyone likes to eat such dishes because we have people that are not local and Chinese which doesn't suit their taste. But the staff was super insistent about it which cmon, once again be professional. You guys are a Michelin star restaurant.

The worse of all, dishes came out so fast that every time each waitress comes, 4 dishes comes out at the same time. You got to pace the food timings because if you rushed all the dishes out, the other dishes are going to be cold and it affects the texture, taste and quality of the food. Then, staff still argued that they have no control over this. Cmon, you obviously can just tell the chefs at the back to slow down with the food. I know you want to faster get your job done and close the shop early but we are here celebrating and we arent that unreasonable to stay till late night. Also, We are ordering approximately close to 10 dishes for each table and food got to be served at a moderate pace. Worse of all, staff even went to argue and retaliate against our request. Is this even reasonable?

To end off, my family have been spending at least hundreds of dollars every visit  when we come to putien because we find that food is decent, a nice location to be and also a place my family can bond together. Yet, none of the staff remembered us and this place does not value their regular customers. Very disappointing really...",,,,

Surprised to see that the restaurant is still doing well after 20 years, even though all the other establishments around the same area have gone to the pits. Sure it needs a new coat of paint but something tells me it‚Äôs not going to happen.

We ordered sashimi, tonkatsu don and grilled chicken set. Food still tastes good although prices have gone up a lot. The sashimi was fresh and thick cut, not the thin slivers of fish you get else where. The grilled chicken (salted, not teriyaki) was a little under cooked in some parts but mostly okay. The tonkatsu was crunchy with every bite and juicily tender inside.

I strongly recommend this old school Japanese restaurant for a simple no frills Japanese meal. Great value for money.",,,,

It‚Äôs lunch time there‚Äôs not much of a Q, but the customer flow is quite consistent.

The boss/Chef has an aura about him, feels like he was the head chef of some high end Japanese Omakase restaurant.
Back to their teriyaki chicken set. At $4.50 it is quite a steal if u compare it with Sakae Shushi.

I believe they use calrose rice (short grain type), it was a bit dry.
The chicken itself was oki, but becomes an impact when u eat it with their panko
Came with a fried sweet potato which was fantastic.

The only time you can get good service from them is when there's no one at the outlet. Maybe they will only make the effort when there's no business there.

The ramen was soggy and starchy. The stock was underwhelming and was almost room temperature.
The chirashi don was worse. The sashimi pieces were very thinly sliced so much so that can't taste the fish. The rice at least was like normal rice.
The gyoza was very oily. There was meant to be 6 pieces of gyoza but we were served 5. Had to ask for missing piece.

The Ireland peking duck is stunning, juicy, plump and delicious. It is succulent, very tender and nicely de-skinned by the staff right in front of you, perfectly wrapped in the serving skin with a nice sauce.

Shark's fin was excellent with this promotional price, served piping hot, HUGE piece of whole fin. The broth is so tasty, topped with bean sprouts

Wasabi prawns is good, could be better if the wasabi flavour be more pronounced, that's purely personal as some people may not be able to take the heat

Char siew and roast pork are to die for! good layers of fat for the char siew and roast pork flavour is good with a crispy skin

4 stars cause they're Japanese grill but the options are limited and has kimchi on their don. Kimchi is a nice touch though.

Meat are grilled nice, not too oily which pairs well with the rice. If you're going to have this as first meal or is a big eater, you should order more.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMlotdlN3EAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,"Been to Anjana a few times over the past couple of years but taking the opportunity to write a review after my most recent visit.

As mentioned in other reviews, I have to admit that the food quality has taken a slight dip from the time they were in the smaller space, to the time they've expanded. Seating, space and ambience is decent with outdoor seating being a plus. Service is quite alright, definitely nothing to complain about.

This time we had chicken dum biriyani and I had to admit that it was a disappointment. The naan set with mutton roganjosh was much better. One suggestion would be to possibly cut down 1 side dish in the set. But pretty much all the items in the set were tasty, and that goes for the naan too. Chicken murtabak was quite huge, a bit oily, but overall quite nice. Mango lassi a tad too thick that it was an effort to drink it using the straw :)

An 'alright' experience at Anjana, though the food is no doubt good, I believe it lacks consistency - unlike the last time. So an improvement in that department would do wonders.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOXIyYnRBRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Food: Shiitake was big, juicy, chewy, not too salty, and most important it had this smoked taste that makes you feel like you're at a barbecue without suffering the heat and smoke in your hair.
Chicken thigh was smooth, juicy, slightly crunchy skin, and no charring.
Quail eggs with pork belly wasn't anything amazing though the combination was new to me and much appreciated. It might have had more impact if the pork belly was more flavorful.

Ambience: BEAUTIFUL. Excluding the one guest who spoke way too loud at times, the place was generally pretty chill. A nice place to spend a night in the park enjoying some delicious food.

Staff: Attentive, friendly, and most importantly, chill. No issues getting someone to take our orders. Refillable drinks are refilled very timely. Just very nice people in general.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was because the online menu was a disappointment.
For a restaurant with such enjoyable delicacies, the new menu decided to go with the standard izakaya style of having NO PICTURES.
Your food is great, and your menu is digital, so why not take a few photos (or grab some of the amazing ones here) and put that on your DIGITAL menu?
Maybe not for the drinks but definitely the food and the desserts. You have nothing to be ashamed about your food, so build a little anticipation and excitement for us by putting some nice photos of the food in your menu!

Food (5/5): We ordered the set A - 5 dumplings, sweet and sour pork, and choice 2x, either Jjajamyeon or Jjamppong. We got 2 Jjamppong.
The dumplings are nice, with vegetable and meat fillings, in particular, liked the sauce that comes with it. Reminds me of Xiao Long Baos.
The sweet and sour pork was great as well - the sauce was served at the side so that the pork remains crispy after some time. The sauce pairs very well with the pork.
I liked the soup of the jjamppong, and the seafood is quite plentiful. The noodles are normal to me, but the portion is huge.

Value (4.5/5): Price is not exactly cheap, but reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

Others: This isn't your trendy kpop kind of place, but rather relaxing, classy kind of place. One thing i picked up immediately when I entered was that they played instrumental music. Also, noticed there were quite a number of koreans in the shop.

Overall (5/5): Great food, reasonably priced. If you are in the location, worth a visit. I wouldn't mind going back for the same food, or try out new ones.",,,,

2) They complained numerous times to our face when we nicely asked to have our plates changed or tea refilled, which I think is quite a standard for Chinese banquet.

3) When we called for one server, she just gruffly signaled for us to ask another server and walked off.

Not worth it to hold your event here even if it‚Äôs cheap, as the service ruins it for everyone. I really wonder if the people who are giving 4 or 5 stars are their own people trying to increase their rating.",,,,

We decided to try this restaurant recommended by ieatipostishoot. Celebrating my wife's birthday, we dined in with a large family but items offered on the menu were mostly ""appetiser"" size and the mains option were only beef noodles and pork chop noodles serving portion for 1 pax, there are no large family size servings options.

When we arrived the staff was rude and asked to shift our seats to make way for their robot server when our seats were already very cramp together.

The portion of dishes were pathetically small and expensive.

Braised pork slices with bun were very thinly sliced.

The Pork Chop noodle taste like dry instant noodle.

The beef noodle only have 3 small piece of meat. Definitely not worth $10 per bowl.

Fried Spring rolls were very very oily.

Steam Xiao Long Bao is quite nice and juicy but no ginger served with vinegar sauce.

No chilli sauce serve in this restaurant.

Not long after our meal we were asked to settle our bill and leave because there was another later reservation.

Overall very poor food quality and poor customer service experience for our family.

Crab - plump and sweet, with a sauce chock full of salted egg and surprisingly light. Lobster porridge - the star is the stock - seafood sweetness that is just the right balance of sweetness, saltiness and umami - drank two bowls and no MSG reaction at all. I will definitely be back for this gem tucked in the middle of nowhere

Update: went back on a Monday and the crab was still good (a little less salted egg taste), and the lobster porridge broth was so dilute - tastes like corn more than lobster‚Ä¶and the lobster was slightly overcooked. The most disappointing dish was the hk steamed grouper - $50 but it was frozen dry overcooked fish.

The outlet at Windstedt was severely understaffed and it reflected poorly on their service.

My husband was directed to the counter instead when he walked up to a staff to make additional orders.

It has a literal pre-requisite to use a smart phone and a qr reader at this shop, which seems a little strange. A customer shouldn't have to feel conflicted by such a process to eat & order food.

Overall, the food portions are pretty standard, the taste was alright. Though upon entry i was given 2 packets of soya sauce & a packet of wasabi, as well as a QR code & a printed guide to ordering food.

While the menus work and are neatly sorted into categories (nigiri, sashimi etc.), it seems I couldn't order for more soya sauce packets nor wasabi. Everything was controlled to prevent wastage, but yet you couldnt order more? This probably explained the lack of amenities across the tables in the shop.

Ordered food was served using the ""train"" plate delivery system, very much akin to genki sushi's system. Though the wait for food was a little longer than expected. I ordered 3 plates initially, 2 arrived within 5 mins, but the 3rd came almost 10 mins after i was done with the first 2 items. I ordered 2 more items and it took about another 10 mins before they were served. The service overall was too slow in my opinion.

Char Kway Teow ($5/$6.5): got no cockles at all. $5 for 2 prawn and small portion, its a bit expensive.

So happy that Xi Yan has opened a new restaurant offering even more to please every diner. With the best of private dining favourites and improvised casual dining selection dishes, I was so impressed, I returned to the restaurant every week for the next 4 weeks.
To be fair, I have been a fan of Xiyan and I was delighted that with this new dining concept, I can  choose all dishes ala carte and not just Omakase - i personally prefer that accessibility.)

Here‚Äôs my die-die must try otherwise go back again list:
- Starters: Cold Okra, Century Egg Pitan Tofu and Signature Tomatoes
- Basil Wine Clams with korean glass noodles (my FAVOURITE dish. Clams preferred over the prawns since you get more from drinking the broth out of all the clam shells)
- Prawns: I‚Äôm torn between the ‚Äòlighter‚Äô Truffle Prawn with Egg White and more ‚Äòexciting‚Äô Kimchee cheese prawn
- Fish: Pomelo Fish (can never go wrong with this) and Garoupa slices with Crispy Rice in Broth (broth is amazing, a bit on the peppery side so if you have young kids, might want to ask them to go easy on pepper)
- Kagoshima Wagyu Beef  (I looooove the tangy green sauce)
- Dongbo Pork Belly Pyramid (my teenage nephews were all over this dish)
If it‚Äôs your first time there, try the Salivating Chicken. But I would try the others that are not on the casual dining menu first, especially if you have limited tummy space cos there‚Äôs really so much on the menu that needs to be gradually explored.
Once again, kudos to them, they manage to make every dish such a deliciously memorable experience.",,,,

Mushroom and Edamame Fried Rice $7.90.
Again, generous portion of fried rice. I was extremely surprised by the amount of vegetables, compared to the pork cutlet fried rice, the box is filled up by 20% more just by vegetables. Mushrooms had good chew and flavor, Edamame was cooked just right, and added good crunch to the rice itself.

Tastes homemade, flavor is good, not overly salty skin and meat, very good as a side.

We were so thrilled at how complete the flavours were and how authentic it was a year back. There was no question- every time we felt like having South Indian meals, it was always Anjana‚Äôs. Now they are very inconsistent. Disappointed thrice already (I know; I keep going back searching for the old flavours which brought back childhood memories). Most recent bad experience was for Tamil puthandu (new year) with curries that were still raw, veges haphazardly cooked without any flavour . I don‚Äôt think they are coping with the increasing volume of orders. They need to increase capacity, staff and not compromise on taste -this is their strength after all! We want the old Anjana back :(

Decided to check this place out since i was in Ang Mo Kio. The coffeeshop was packed with people and it wasn't easy for me to get a table.

Ordering was pretty straight forward, you will be issued a buzzer once you have paid. I ordered the chicken chop which was SGD$6.50. Food was ready in no time. Portion wise, seems quite little. My chicken chop was a little tough. It was seasoned well as certain parts tasted extremely salty.

The owner let me try the Dirty Fries ‚Äî fries with parmesan, nacho cheese and teriyaki sauce. I must say the triple combo is satisfying. Besides that, the chicken is well grilled and the balsamic vinegar is pretty good. I like the fact that I could ask them to separate the balsamic vinegar from the chicken.

However, the pan-fried dumplings (guo tie) were amazing! I would definitely order this again because of how juicy and tasty it was. I think I could actually finish a plate of it by myself! The guo tie is also different from the usual guo tie that I've tried from other places. It wasn't wrapped on both ends, so you have to quickly finish it in a few bites or just eat it in one shot, else the meat may slip out.

Other than these two dishes, we also ordered a bowl of noodles that seemed to be seasonal (I couldn't find the name on the menu). The pork was soft and flavourful, and the noodles were different from what I expected it to be. Usually, Chinese noodles are thinner, but the noodles that I had were thicker in size and were a bit like udon. The sauce was also on the sweeter side, and the noodles came with a huge serving of bean sprouts. Overall, this dish was not bad and the portion was alright.

In the end, we were forced to pay full price without the promised discount. Not sure it was a scam but I definitely feel cheated.

They then proceeded to hand me a buzzer. So I guess I had to wait a second round. Eventually the food came, chicken was ok though the sauce was good, overall I felt it wasn't worth the $7.5 though, I'd skip this and go straight for the $1.3 dim sum...there's some serious competition at this place and there's no excuse for advertising a free food item that isn't ready...how strange.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNFkyMlpnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,1,"I don‚Äôt understand how this restaurant clocked 4.1 based on reviews. Neither the food or service is worth that much.

Came with 2 young kids in tow for lunch after a zoo outing.

I placed an order for crispy silver bait ( salted and pepper in direct translation) with less pepper sand explained that my kids don‚Äôt take spicy food. The dish was served  tossed with chopped chilli padi and rejected since the kids can‚Äôt take spicy food. Let‚Äôs take this as an oversight from the staff and move on.

The young server passed the dish to another waitress in bob hair and explained the situation. The bob hair waitress decided she need to investigate the situation and brought another 2  colleagues along to discuss. So, we had 3 persons standing at our table discussing while we were trying to have a meal. I find this behaviour to be unacceptable at a restaurant. Even busy cafes have better service standards.

The staff then tried noisily to sort it out with the kitchen which was situated 1 table away from us and separated by a folding screen. I couldn‚Äôt take it and feedback to the staff to sort out the issue quietly. The staff wasn‚Äôt able to understand my comment and brought back the bob hair waitress.

The bob hair waitress came back and defended her approach saying she needed to sort out the issue that‚Äôs why she had to look at the food order. I agreed but do it without fanfare.

She took the comment away and brought some colleagues to the folding screen to ‚Äòtalk‚Äô about my comment. The folding screen blocks view ,not noise. I can hear everything that was being discussed. It‚Äôs unprofessional. An experienced customer service staff should conduct themselves better.

The food quality is average and portions are small. Hokkien Mee was their signature dish but it was a tad too sweet for my liking. Grilled pork portion was good but really small. There was a dozen slivers and certainly not the small chunks shown in the menu. The fried fish bait was nicely fried with no hint of pepper on its second try. Restaurant was only 20% occupied when I visited.

To be fair, the younger staff were diligent in changing plates, taking orders and serving customers. If the restaurant wants to do better, more attention needs to paid to its customer service level. Hire more qualified staff to lead the restaurant. The quality of food will not be able to attract returning customers. There are also stiff competition on the same stretch of road. Lots of cafes at Brooks I and Brooks II. Parking at the restaurant is also limited. We came at 12:30 and was able to secure a lot. Carpark was full when we left at 2pm.

Future goers, receipt attached. Even a MacDonald‚Äôs meal is more worth it. ÂêÉ‰∫Ü‰∏ÄËÇöÂ≠êÊ∞îÂíåÁÅ´

I just realised the receipt was changed to reflect the order as spicy. The original food order was printed less pepper. Not a honorable move by the restaurant. If the food order never reflected less spicy elected, I‚Äôm sure the waitress would not have entertained  me when I rejected my dish.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydzRyazdnRRAB,Prata Raya,1,"Have been a regular customer and fan of their food here for the past 1year, but my experience today totally ruin my rating of them to the pit bottom.

Went in as usual and saw a number of customers at front tables sitting down which I assumed that they are either waiting their takeaway or some are food delivery people waiting too. So I stand at the usual spot to wait patiently for my order to be taken.

At that hour (3-4pm), its not crowded and there are empty seats and tables. Behind the counter, 1 staff is making prata and the staff whom suppose to take order is packing (what it seems like) a big order and so I waited patiently for him to be done.

Then two of the aunties initially sitting down which I stated earlier whom I assume are waiting for their orders, started taking a tray plate and picked their indian rojak along the counter area too. I didnt think much, and one of the auntie started queing n waiting beside me with her rojak.

Then the staff packing finally done, and first thing he raised his voice slightly at me ""you want to order, you stand at this spot la!"" while pointing to the spot behind the auntie holding the rojak. I was taken by surprised and assumed he meant I should be standing behind the auntie, so I said ""but I was here very long already!""
He said ""very long also have to wait what!""
He look at the auntie and asked ""Who come first?""
The auntie pointed at me.
Then that staff gave an LL face and said something along ""then I take your order la!"" as usual with the raised voice and fierce attitude.

I was damn upset by his lousy attitude and service that I told him i""ts OK, I dont want order already!"" And left.

I had ordered the p1 platter combo (as shown in image) and my sides as ratatouille (yes shocking to find this on the menu in a kopitiam!) and mash potato. Not the best ratatouille i've had but its on par with your average french restaurant in singapore. Mash done right as it was creamy and smooth. Pork chop was crispy on the outside juicy on the inside with the fats perfectly cooked (which melts in your mouth if done right!). Great moist chicken with a smokey creamy sauce and finally, a BBQ glazed beef brisket. I was skeptical at first thinking it was average but this place totally caught me off guard and for $25, you can't find an alternative that gives this much food on a plate!. The chef was really nice as when I was collecting the dish he explained the different cuts off meats. The finale was when he finished the dish off by cracking peppercorns onto the main platter.

My only regrets here is that I got greedy and took a bite of everything, which caused me not to enjoy the chicken and pork as the smokiness from the brisket was overpowering.

As for the Saba fish, they literally torched the raw saba fish infront of us till it‚Äôs cooked. But i personally still find the taste too fishy so I asked them if they could cook it longer. The lady then brought it to the kitchen and microwave it. Which after that I still find the taste fishy, and so I requested them to fried the saba fish instead which they kindly did so.

The highlight from the set is definitely the waygu where you torch each piece of the waygu to your preferred doneness. Since it was thinly sliced, I torched it to rare. I was really expecting the ‚Äúmelt-in-your-mouth‚Äù experience but unfortunately not. However I must say the waygu is still flavourful and tender.

I did not enjoyed the edamame though because I was expecting fresh edamame but they used frozen edamame instead.

Thank you for acknowledging my review. The first step towards making improvement is acknowledgment. Even if there are other sides to the story as you claim.

I was lucky and had the chance to speak to the owners. I understand that most of the side dish are made in-house (including the coleslaw that I had).

There's many competitions around for japanese food but I wouldn't mind patronizing them again (fingers crossed their food standards don't drop as they are very new)

We didn't have issues with our food but the next table was giving feedback to the chef that the salmon was raw. Not sure if they ordered Aburi or actual raw salmon but the chef said it is suppose to be raw unless customers want it to be fully cooked. I agree somewhat but I think if customers want it cooked the chef can always offer to take the dish back and cook the salmon aburi style. Cooking sashimi cuts thoroughly is a waste but if the customer wants it more cooked why not compromise and do some changes to make them happy?

Ordering your food with as set is definitely a better deal ($4.50 c/w soup, cake, coffee/tea/soft drink).

I like the Friday‚Äôs tomato soup with basil.
Lamb rack was nicely done, the brown sauce was not over powering so that with pinch of salt it brought out the goodness of it. $23

Ribeye steak was good enough for me, reminds me of Jack‚Äôs place. 220g (I think) of goodness at $22.80 as a set I feel is quite a good deal.

Quite taken aback overall drop in pretty much everything or I had a much rosier view back then when I was younger

Could tell they were understaffed right off the bat. Definitely got off from the wrong foot when they asked if I wanted wasabi and soy. I've never been asked that question ever anywhere else in my entire life in a Japanese restaurant when you order anything with raw fish

What would you expect the answer to be and what situation led to such a question in the first place ?

Doesn't help when it turned up with the blot of wasabi marinating itself in a saucer of sauce . This was  already pointed out by other reviewers and even with responses from the management, if there's no change its pretty clear things are not going to change . So please don't drop some message after this ""you'll look into it ""

Notice that tea ? It says refillable in the menu . But that's not the issue,  I choose that in spite of the fact i have utmost confidence it wouldn't be refilled because that's the standard you pretty much expect of the service staff nowadays

What I hadn't counted on is staff passing by checking the mug, peeping down at it throughout the meal 4 to 5 times  and not doing anything about it . I'm fine if your standard of service precludes refills but the repeated visits was as useful as asking me if I wanted wasabi .

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dmN2cE53EAE,KFC NTU,1,"Ordered a BBQ pocket meal, and a zinger box with a choice of chicken for take-away.

First thing, the BBW pocket was missing, just the fries and drinks. The zinger box was fine, it had everything.

Second, the chicken i asked for was original, but the one in the box was crispy.

Third, the chicken and zinger burger was dry.

The staff were not focused at all on what they were doing. I had to remind them for the drinks that came with the meal and the box.

Anyone who wants to go should probably triple check their orders, especially for drinks and every item they ordered.

Ordering - sorry aunty if I spoil your day dreaming at 1.15pm on a beautiful Saturday. Wasn't paying attention on my order.. but got it done.
Serving- was fast with my egg and onion prata and one kosong prata with a bot of mineral water.
Food- as u can see in pic is a little black with some charred black ash on it. Crisp...Yes it's crispy.. but a little bland on the dough. The egg and onion too was crispy but also tasteless. A nearby hawker can make slightly better one which Cost one dollar lesser. Curry was fish curry. A little sour but it's edible .
Damage is less than $7.
The *best* part was having my meal halfwaynthru and I saw a cockroach strolling in the restaurant. Hmm.. must be the captain checking on patrons. I got a video of it as I do not wanna alarm it. Should be the owner who need to check out his ""employed"" captain.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdHN6TVN3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"If you've grown up in Toa Payoh, you would have eaten or at least known this Nasi Padang. Hailed from 1968, they had been here since forever and moved around Toa Payoh Lorong 1 a few times. Saying I had grown up with this stall is no kidding, and I probably have their Nasi Padang at least once a week back then. Some friends have always said, Nasi Padang stalls love to overcharge Chinese customers, unlike what an out of touch MP said some years ago, $2.50 gets you Nasi Padang with Drumstick. Some would say because Chinese are rich, we charge you more. Others with a more logical approach, they are selling Halal food. While Chinese can feed on non Halal, we are depriving other Muslims of their food when they sold us their servings. In any case, I leave it to your judgement, I did had experiences when the same Malay guy ordered the exact same thing in front of me, and i did got charged at least $2 more compared to his plate of Nasi Padang at Che Rose. But I don't take it against them. There's only so many pieces of their delicious Fried Chicken and they do get sold out usually mid lunch peak. In any case, I am back here today at 1230pm, all I love are in stock (except drumsticks) and I am game to eat. The short queue in front of me are all Chinese diners. Figures. My order $11. All my favourites since I was a kid. Fried chicken, Beef Rendang, Bergedil, fried egg, mixed cabbage on rice topped with their curry chicken sauce and sambal. Some might think $11 for this is horrendous. I think its fair. I knew their Beef and Chicken are delivered daily. How I knew? Cos I used to know a relative whom delivered their beef fresh daily from Tekka Market. He had since retired but vendors he knew took over. Fresh supplies daily is not cheap in a coffeeshop stall quantity. That's quality food. And for the same quality if you eat the same in a restaurant, trust me you will be paying way more than $11. Tender and flavourful rendang, crispy and juicy fried chicken, freshness you can taste. Their Nasi Padang and sambal is of a very local Malay style. A familiar taste we grow up with. Now the pair of sisters took over from Auntie Rose. Still you can see Auntie Rose seating at the stall with a watchful eye. Quality and flavour totally the same from when I first had them 4 decades ago. I will definitely come back for more.",,,,

I like the way they make chinese cuisine fusion and yet did not lose the identify of the dish. So when i was deciding where to go to celebrate my family member birthday, i choose Xi Yan.

It was for a friday lunch and choices were between Xi Yan and other Hotels' chinese restaurants lunch menus. Xi Yan stood out immediately because it offers more variety and at a much affordable cost. Parking is also easy because Maxwell Chamber has its own car park. Car Park rebate comes with the dining.

The staff are very attentive and took very nice photos of us! Knowing how to take with right angle and background.

When i casually mentioned it was to celebrate birthday, they surprised us with the longevity bun!

Their western dishes are value for money. The portion is also generous. Set meals of $4.50 includes a drink (coffee, tea or milo), soup of the day and a dessert. It did not take too long for the food to be served upon order. For the coffee and dessert, you would need to let them know when to be served after you finish your main meal.

The ambience is also rather homely and is suitable for family with kids to dine in at.

The food was creatively plated. Especially the delicate cod with miso that I ordered, portions were quite small, but much detail went into the plating which I appreciated.

We ended up here because it was busy everywhere. Too many people in this mall.

Anyway, our lunch was just okay. I remembered that Ichiban had a much better quality but maybe that was years ago.

The menu definitely changed a little. I was hoping for a good lunch but got an okay okay lunch instead.

So what went wrong today? Firstly they served our soya sauce with wasabe in it. That's not Japanese at all. That's a Singaporean thing. Never do that!

Secondly, my SOBA was served room temperature. This should have been served chilled.

Thirdly, the Karei Karaage was not crispy as it should have been. This was rather disappointing but the flavors with pretty good.

The food didn't turn out so great but our waiter was amazing. He really took good care of us. He made sure our drinks were always full and he was very attentive.

at first i thought it's only 1 piece maybe they put a bit of meat only, turns out all 3 pieces inside meat like this photo.

see photo yourself, $3.80 each, a few meagre pieces of dry hard meat. taste bad also, don't think will even try the restaurant. please warn others.

honestly, i have never been so angry, and tasted something so bad. i have had better one that only cost $2.50 each with more meat inside.

I ordered the beef cheeks, pork loin fajita, wagyu burger and lava cake.

The Wagyu burger was disappointing. It cost a whopping 18 dollars! However, the patty was really bland. There was no seasoning at all. I had to add my own pepper and salt to the patty to make it tasty. The onions were raw and not grilled. However, I have to say that the fries were good! ($18)

Next, the beef cheeks were soft and tender to the bone. Sauce was decent and mash potato is creamy! However, there's not enough sauce to pair with the mash potato as it was paired with the beef cheeks. (Preferred the fries). They could have been more generous with the salad portion. Overall a bit too pricey for this dish. ($22)

Lastly, the pork loin fajita was surprisingly good!! Pork was cooked and seasoned well! It was paired with onions which was good as well! The combination with the wrap and the pork was really delicious. It even came with a side of sour cream and guacamole! Overall a really really good dish that I recommend :)) It was the cheapest out of the 3 main dish. ($16)

When dessert came, I was pleasantly surprised on the presentation of the dish. The lava cake came off a bit sweet but paired really well with the vanilla ice cream. (Although they probably used a cheap ice cream brand) A great way to end the meal :) ($6)

Overall, dish place is a must try if you have the money as it comes off a little pricey. Would recommend if you are finding a place to splurge. Till we meet again, au revoir!",,,,

However, what I recommend is the plain prata‚Äîcrispy and delicious without being overly oily. Sometimes simplest is best. I accompanied it with curry mutton and seasonal vegetables from the √† la carte menu, though I would try something else, as the mutton was chewy and the vegetables (eggplant) absorbed too much oil.

The ambience was really nice, modern without being too cold. My only critique is a lack of ambient music to set the mood.

Ordering can be done through the 2 kiosks available, payment only by Nets. For customers who may need help, there is a counter where you can place order with staff but payment also by Nets only.

Once order is ready (you can order from any combination of stalls), you will get a receipt with a number, look out for your number on display and then collect from the numbered locker.

How to get there: bus stop after mosque along Braddell Road, just in front of Blk 978 Toa Payoh North building. Grain & Hop is on level 2, access by escalator (see picture).

If driving, you can park at the MSCP within blk 978, as open air car park mainly for season (but on Sunday quite empty). Alternative is to park at Blk 199 Toa Payoh North open air carpark just behind the industrial estate, short 5 min walk.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHRQc2t3RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Had a family dinner here for 10 pax. Entering the restaurant was painless after reservations made earlier.
Service - I was disappointed with the lack of attention to our table and the very slow drip of replenishment food which we had ordered through the website. Initial round of meats and other condiments served barely covered the amount of people we had in our table which resulted in each person only having a piece of meat before running out. We had to order again through the website ordering system and waited more than 20 mins for them to actually give us more food. Regrettably this only happened after I had to literally chase down a staff at the other end of the place and complain.By the way I don't blame the staff for the restaurant being clearly short handed.
Foodwise the quality given was average at best which did not match the asking price for a buffet . For reference per head we were charged SGD 35++ per adult not inclusive of an additional optional charge of SGD4.90 ++ for free flow drinks / desserts. For that price in comparison would have expected prawns to be available but this was only available if you add a further charge for premium meat/seafood. which would have brought the price up per head to SGD 50++.You could get a buffet with oysters / prawn at a hotel at that price.
In conclusion I would not recommend the restaurant at this moment due to food quality versus price asked.",,,,

The pork bone soup tasted EXACTLY like BIAP‚Äôs collagen soup and they even had the signature bean curd rolls?! With their 3-5pm 40% off it‚Äôs like getting BIAP for half the price. Everything we got was amazing as always for a restaurant under the paradise group; must order items include the bean curd roll, ebiko prawn paste and ramen.

Coming back for the 4th time on 28/3/22. Our staples for 3 ppl include:
- 1 portion of beef
- 1/2 portion of pork belly
- mushrooms: oyster, enoki, king oyster (not recommended to get shimeji as they swim around n get lost in the soup)
- pork and chive dumpling
- ebiko prawn paste
- 2 x ramen
- bean curd skin roll
- veggies: cabbage, tang-o
- condiments! My personal fav includes vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, spring onions and parsley.",,,,

The salmon was fresh . Just a little weirded out by the warm rice that warmed my salmon . Everything was warm by the time it reached me . Warm raw fish isn't my thing .
Portions not the type to leave you satisfied . Felt like I was rationing myself during the meal . The fish looks so sparse on the rice like my hair on my head .
The gyoza, an offhand top up was probably the highlight of the meal .

If I ever returned,  it probably would be for ramen and not this , assuming I do . The only draw seems to be a place you bring friends if it needs to be halal .

The star of the show was surprisingly the fried egg with yellow chives. It doesn't look like much, but the egg was fluffy with many layers, full of umami and the earthiness of the yellow chives just gave it that perfect bite. The other surprise was the stir fried french beans - not oily at all, each bite juicy with a spicy kick. The chicken noodles were springy and nice, and the xiao long baos were okay.

Wth seriously? If you out of meat, then say dish nt available la! Not give us scraps and leftovers from the kitchen but charge us full price.

FYI, we came to dine in at about 5.30-6ish. I wonder how is that even considered ""late"" in their minds, when the dinner crowd only started picking up at about 6.30pm after us.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdThEeVpBEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"We arrived at 11am and there was surprisingly no queue. But once we bought our food, a queue formed.

We ordered the small bowl ($4.50) and opted for Ipoh hor fun. Sadly, there was no more fish cake, so we only had the handmade fishball and tau pok.

At first I had commented to my friend that the noodles seemed like a lot. But in the end, I finished them in no time and was scrapping the bottom of my bowl. ü§™

The hor fun was flavourful as it soaked up the sauce. My friend thought it wasn‚Äôt salty enough but it was just nice for my palate. Plus the bits of pork lard gave it an extra kick.

I read a blogger‚Äôs review that the fishball isn‚Äôt as bouncy as others as it is handmade from only yellowtail fish meat and no fillers are added. But I thought it was very bouncy. Not a big fan of the tau pok but I don‚Äôt mind it.

Overall, not bad and will return if I‚Äôm in the vicinity. And I like that the cook and the auntie cashier are friendly. (I dislike hawkers who scold or are rude to their customers and will not patronise them regardless of how nice their food may be.)",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcDk3YkRBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Spacious with soothing decor, clean and new, comfortable environment. Slightly different concept from their beauty in a pot branches as this gives you individual pots on a burner at your table. I guess it makes it slightly hard to see what‚Äôs in your pot and less options for soup base, but you get exclusivity! Also, they have kindly sorted into sets for the number of pax with all the popular ingredients (yay fried beancurd!) thus you don‚Äôt have to mull over what‚Äôs best to order. You can‚Äôt change any items in the set though.

The sets are really filling and gives you a bit of everything which is really nice. We took a 2 pax set $48.80++ and that excludes sauces ($2.20++ per pax). We added some beef and fried luncheon meats too. Water is not complimentary and chargeable at $0.30++ per glass refillable.

Their soup bases are similar (and more) as paradise beauty in a pot with the exclusion of collagen soup not available for sets. I stuck to my usual tomato (would have loved to have mushroom soup) but would try to be more adventurous next time.

Ingredients provided are fresh and the meatballs are really good and most tasted handmade.

Service is also polite and warm, with service staff constantly refilling your soup or water, and reminding you with little tips.

Honestly, the noodles are quite decent with a nice texture and the char siew was good with a nice honeyed glaze. Roast pork was too salty. However, this stall will not get anything higher because of the very aggressive staff touting you to eat here and pressurizing you to order without knowing the prices which are fairly exorbitant for what you‚Äôre getting.

When me and my colleagues went there to eat, we spent about 100 plus with drinks included. While eating at chatting, as long as one person food is finished the waitress immediately clear the plate while others are still eating. It gives the rest of the people pressure to eat faster. Yes granted there was a queue outside but we have been there since covid period to support. But when business oicks up, they keep clearing your plates while others are eating. Hinting to u that u should leave soon. Problem is drinks are refillable for tea at it cost 3dollars per cup. Yet while we are still chatting and drinking they keep the cups too. This for me is too much. Come up to us and tell us that if we are able to go off for them to accommodate people inside to eat. I will not feel so bad.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdlo2YVN3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"This is a warning for everyone. For the price that you pay here, you will get non-existent service and food that is worse than what you will get at hawker centre.

From the beginning, their service staff did not care about our needs; half their staff kept glancing at their watch and pretending to be busy. The seating was too close and uncomfortable. The tea was watered down. The sound system broke and was horribly managed.

The food is even worse. The roasted pork was partially uncooked on the inside, with the skin side being extremely tough and tasteless. The appetizers (lotus paste bun and other assortments) looked suspiciously like what I could buy from the FairPrice supermarket cheaply, and were poorly prepared.

The ""sashimi"" turned out to be cheap raw red grouper that was meant to be cooked in hot soup, which was merely a thin broth with some herbs and too many red dates. The pot's fully metal ladle was left in the boiling soup, scalding our attempts to get it out. In addition, the staff walked around with the burner lit dangerously close to our hair.

The spinach and vegetables set was tough, cooked in a pot of overly salted water using cheap fried anchovies. To add insult to injury, when I brought champagne there, the staff did not care to ensure it was chilled.

The exterior of the restaurant was dirty and wet with what looked like the tossed out leftovers of food. If you are going there, wearing shorts and cheap sandals will be a suitable choice.

All in all, the price you pay at this restaurant ensures you obtain bad service, badly cooked food, and an extremely uncomfortable dining experience. For the same price, you can dine for far better at Imperial Treasures, or a classy Japanese restaurant, or even a well-run restaurant.

The wait - ridiculously long waiting time of 1hour for a post-lunch timing and on a Monday. This is partly due to the closure of at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the restaurant and manpower shortage. Any other sushi chain doesn't make customers wait 1h.

Fish and Chips at $5.50, you will get 2 crispy fish fillets, coleslaw, baked beans and a fried bun. The fillets were crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted great and old school.

Fried Chicken Cutlet at $5.50 too, was a no frill, old school type of western food.  Freshly deep fried in a wok of hot oil upon order and served immediately with the sides. The cutlet has a thin, golden exterior crust which was exceptionally crispy, and the meat was tenderly and juicy.

Broth is thick and good, I like it a lot. Chashu is slightly tasteless, but it's to my liking. Feels fatty and seems like will melt inside your mouth. Eggs are the runny kind as usual, and the seaweed or nori is super huge. They have black fungus as well. If they could add bamboo shoots I think that complements the taste.

Ordered the $5.50 egg fried rice and pandan leaf chicken. Cashier mistakenly keyed as pork chop fried rice. Nvm I just go along to see if the higher price of $8.50 is worth it.

Verdict: Overrated & overpriced food for total damage of $10

Pork chop was really tough, not crispy at all and taste bland.

Fried rice got nice 'wok hei' yet was bland as well. Normal coffeeshop tze char's fried rice taste better at lower price.

Saving grace was the pandan leaf chicken which was not bad. But it was a extremely tiny piece which didn't justify the $1.50 price.

It was very filling for both me and my bf. We also got the tom yum crab pasta which is very creamy and has the subtle tom yum taste and it is not overwhelming compared to other Tom Yum pasta. We both added $6 for the set meal (mushroom/minestrone soup , garlic bread and root beer float). Overall the dining in was a pretty good experience.

As soon as we were seated, it felt as if we were transported away from the heartlands with the high class decor and atmosphere. The service was top notch with each staff being very welcoming and prompt. The sushi and sashimi were delectable and tasted fresh. My wife went with their Udon which had a very delicious broth and springy noodles. I went with the Yakiniku Don and it had strong beefy flavours and savoury sauce.

Don't sleep on their dessert offerings too, this is one you won't want to miss! The Matcha ice cream was great but I can't stop raving about their Chocolate Wafer! Vanilla Ice cream with great quality thin chocolate bar in the centre sandwiched between wafers - every bite kept me wanting more and luckily for us, the portion was very generous.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit here if you're ever craving for great Japanese food.",,,,

As I stayed nearby, I returned to the outlet at around 9pm with my bento, to feedback to the staff at the outlet about the sour broccoli. The staff replied me that the sourness was probably came from the wafuku sauce added. I explained to the staff that it was only the broccoli that tasted sour and no other part of the bento, which would not be the case if the sauce was added to the bento. The staff took my bento over and looked at it for a good 2 seconds and then asked if I wanted him to throw it away, with no other follow up action like checking if the existing stock of vegetables did go bad.

The quality of the food was subpar to the standards provided when dining in.Quantity of the peking duck was so much more lesser compared to the one we had when we dined in at your restaurant and the crackers lost their crispiness.

I gave it another shot today. I head inside the restaurant half expecting the chicken being dry and hard again. I was greeted by friendly staffs. Nice.

I ordered the mixed grill that comes with a sausage, chicken and pork, served with coleslaw and onion rings. The set came with a drink and either a mushroom soup or minestrone soup. I chose the former.

The mushroom soup tasted bland. It‚Äôs white in colour. I do not know if it‚Äôs supposed to be that white. They serve a slice of soft bread with garlic spread. Nothing fancy.

The main course came before I could finish my soup. Fast. Too fast. I‚Äôm fine with it since I did not like the soup. This time round the chicken was moist. Thank goodness for that. The pork was smaller in size but tasted moist too. The coleslaw was not heavy on the sauce. Maybe if they give you a small wedge of lemon for your coleslaw would be nice. Anyway the onion rings were cold. If felt like the cook had made a basket of it and just left it there till someone orders it. Should have ordered the hot veggies instead.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNeHBHQ3RnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"First up: if you're looking for this place, be sure to be look out for the Chinese signboard. Don't be looking for ""Traditional Penang Food"" in English now. It'll be a black signboard, with Chinese words in white. See my pic if you want to see what it looks like.

Secondly, note that my review is only for the chendol.

Is this chendol better than the one at Penang? I'd say definitively, no.

Ice: not finely shaved.

Noodles: nice green colour... No comments about colouring though, since I don't know what goes in there. But this is the brightest that I've seen of the chendols today (I reviewed Four Seasons Toa Payoh, and Dove Desserts earlier today). Unflavoured, which is disappointing.

Red beans: ahem if I want Penang chendol, I would be looking for those delightfully soft - and sweet! - kidney beans which I first tasted at Penang (and haven't found anywhere else since). You get a reasonable quantity of beans... But you should expect that, at $2.5, the most expensive of the chendols so far today.

Overall: nothing really strikes me about this chendol. It's middle of the road as far as I'm concerned... Or maybe I've taken too much chendol for today. I don't think so though. The gula melaka isn't generous, but you do get bits of it. The nice thing about it is it seems to come by default with *two* metal spoons, so in case you're sharing, you don't need to ask to one more. And the spoons are metal. An upgrade from the plastic ones that you get at Four Seasons, and Dove Desserts.",,,,

Rice was fragrant with sesame oil. Taste-wise it was good. Salty and slight sweetness from the black sauce. Their chili is really spicy and slightly sour. I usually just mix it in together with the rice which adds an extra kick to the dish. For the ingredients, there were quite a few chunks of chicken but I didn't like that the skin was on as the skin was very chewy. There were also two small pieces of salted fish and only ONE miserable slice of my favourite Chinese sausage. *Sobs*

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMFpfVmJ3EAE,La Caf√© & Bar,1,"Food (mains) here are good. Authentic filipino food. Desserts can be improved. Reason for my 1 star rating though is the service. (1) Experience from dinner some time back: We ordered mains (rice and sinigang) and desserts. The desserts were served first. I told the server that we‚Äôre having desserts after our meal. She was unhappy about that and said the desserts cannot be taken back to the kitchen and we should have told her earlier that we‚Äôre having the desserts after the meal. Uh okay? Isn‚Äôt that the normal sequence of a meal? (2) Experience from lunch today: We ordered 2 dishes with rice and drinks. Drinks, rice and 1 dish were served first. 15 minutes later, noticing that the next table who came after us got the same dish that we were missing, i followed up with the server. She checked with the kitchen and came back to inform us our dish will come after 15-20 minutes. No apologies whatsoever. Just informed us to wait. So to give her context of how long we have been waiting, I told her the table that came after us already got the same dish. At this point, the server blew up and raising her voice told me that if I wanted, she will take the dish from the other table and serve it to us.  Of course I said no. Before I could say anything else, she stalked off. From our table, I could hear her complaining loudly to another staff/ manager. Dish was finally served but the rice and the other dish had gotten cold already at this point. No one (no staff or manager) came to our table to explain or even just to understand what had happened. Originally, I let the first bad experience pass and gave them the benefit of the doubt but after today‚Äôs experience, it‚Äôs clear (at least to me) that the management need to be made aware of their staffs ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô.",,,,

It actually came with 2 rice but we ordered xtra YiFu Mee and it blended perfectly well with the roasted duck.

Home make Barley water was my favourite drink it's not too sweet and good to the taste.

I was at their branch at City Square Mall a month ago, i shall say that they were very consistent with their taste gastronomically, you don't see sub-standard throughout their outlets with my experienced. Kudos to the teams.

Damage was aroundüí≥ $62,  worthy for 2 pax.

Waitpersons were friendly and service was prompt, attentive and welcoming üòÅüòÅüòÅgood job!

It's lunch time and there's enough spaces between tables it can easily accommodate big group and its not rowdy and noisy here it's comfortable and relaxing.

3) we asked for another set of burner but was declined to unknown reasons.

5) we had 3 people sharing 1 burner but we spent 3 hours in there but did not even finish cooking our one and only order of meat.

6) if the Thomson outlet could change my ala-carte order to buffet because of their technical issues im sure the toa payoh outlet could do so too.

7) i spent $104 for 3 people ordering only $50+ worth of meat.

Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak. It's hands-down our family's favourite coconut-infused meal. No attention is sacrificed to detail. The rice; bryani, cooked with coconut milk. This gives the Nasi that beady-rice appearance which doesn't clump together when served. Bryani itself already has an aromatic smell on its own, so infused with coconut milk, brings the flavour and aroma to a whole new level altogether!

Those wings! Amazingly crispy! We love just how our meal is accompanied by the 'music' of crackly sounds whenever somebody bites into their chicken wing! The seasoning permeates into the meat, moist and steamy-soft layers that follow the crispy outsides!

And what is Nasi Lemak without its sambal? The sambal used here is sweet and tangy, with hints of onion-sweetness, and paired with their already flavourful rice, makes for a meal befitting a Tuan:)",,,,

On service,the staff was very patient in explaining to me the differences between the 3 types of grilled chicken,and took the trouble to double confirm my orders.

Speaking of food quality,this is so far the best grilled chicken I had in Singapore.The outside is a bit charred and crispy,while the inside is tender and juicy.When you try to extract the flesh,it comes off easily.Only priced at $4.50 (for chicken only),which is very reasonable,considering the effort put in and the quality.

The Nasi Lemak was full of coconut flavor.Not the typical type you find here,which only has a hint of coconut flavor.It is comparable to Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak,which in my opinion is one of the best in Singapore.

It was well worth my effort travelling up all the way just to try it.But what really attracted me to give the stall a try was the owner's sincere gesture in handling the complaint made by a customer.

We usually see owners or customer service officers responding with an apology,which is all.But this stall owner was willing to offer the customer a free meal,I think action speaks louder than words and I applaud such an act.

One final point: I don't take egg.I told the staff that I wanted my set without egg,and she immediately told me that I could change the egg to something else.I was impressed.

Most of the time,if I said I didn't want something,that was it,no replacement,and the amount of food given is the same,price is also the same.I would say this stall is very ethical in its business operation.Thumbs up and may your business prosper.",,,,

It's no longer on the menu but this time, I shared 2 of the Nepali dishes - the lamb and chicken with rice - with 2 friends and the pakora (?). They were all delicious. Pakora was piping hot and crispy when it arrived, and all snapped up by our table of 5 immediately. The lamb was so flavourful that I can't wait to have it again the next time I go. The chicken was good, too, but I prefer the lamb. Only downer was the yuzu drink that tasted like it had too little yuzu.

3rd Beside their signature items all other dish was serve cold (room temperature food plus in Aircon room). Really feel that the Zi char in coffee shop will taste better than most of the food .

However, on my second visit, the quality of service by the cashier was disappointing compared to the first time I visited.
The cashier during my first visit gave me chopsticks and the cashier for my second visit says it‚Äôs $0.20 for chopsticks which is reasonable but I didn‚Äôt get it.

The cashier did not finish my transaction before moving on to attend to the grab orders. The transaction took a little long. I think the quality of service could have been improved or they could have better manage their manpower in this outlet.

Their chicken slice servings are peeled off fresh chicken parts as seen from the white colored chicken slices..unlike most stalls which serve overbight chicken or parts that are barely edible
Top it up with their begedil...and the dish is complete...begedil is well prepared...moist and not soaking in used oil

The fish head curry is their famous dish which really delivers. The assam curry is tangy and spicy, touched by sweetness from the vegetables and pineapple. The fish head is meaty, unlike many places. All of it comes together to make a well-balanced whole.

On the downside, the famed Kyoto pork is a little dry and flavor doesn't seep all the way through the meat. Makes for a very instagrammable dish though because of it's flaming presentation.

Most of their food are made to order. Mostly are fried or teppanyaki style. The usual sauces or ingredients are teriyaki, Japanese mayonnaise, katsu items, pickled vegetables and Kimchi.

Their hotplate soba fish looks quite popular here. It comes with a seaweed soup and rice. Their bento sets looks nice too. In total they have about 40 items on the menu.

Overall its good enough to eat for lunch and dinner if you just bored of Chinese or western food.",,,,

Really competent bowl of ramen at coffeeshop prices - chasu is flavourful and sliced to a good thickness, ajitama has perfect molten yolk and absorbed the soy sauce, tonkotsu broth and ramen are well executed. The spicy black oil was different from what I tried at some Japanese ramen restaurants, tasted a little bit like light curry broth.

Certain dish only come in standard size whilst other have different sizes. Make sure you check when ordering. You can ask them to help you estimate the dish size based on your group size.

My favourite dish was the Asam fish filet. They packed a punch in terms of sour and spiciness. On that day they ran out of the whole fish hence the filet.

Unfortunately, the standard of the food has gone southwards. We ordered a number of stuffs, from prata to murtabak to maggi goreng to nasi biryani. Only the prata withstood the taste test. The rest left much to be desired. The maggi goreng lacks 'wok hei' and the chicken meat in wre all dry and rubbery.  The meat in the murtabak is quite bland, so overall the dish lacks oomph and flavour. The mutton nasi biryani was very average. I've tasted better ones even in neighbourhood coffee shops.

Billing was horrible where items are just listed on how many quantities of the price tag we took which we can‚Äôt tally if the item is there on the table or just added randomly. Bill is not shocking but could use more work to let customers understand what is charged

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURheHRELTlRRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"I liked Malaysia food very much. Been supporting these outlets since it opened. However. I realized the standard of food dropped. The taste deteriorate. Eventhough after I suggested to the black shirt manager. The food did not improve. It came to the point that I finally made up my mind. Not to patronise the food stall anymore. Reasons being :
1) pricey. And portion is disappointing. Eat but cannot fill the stomach even with the large portion bought.
2) food is served with few or little tiny portions of meat and prawns or just 2 prawns. Few bean sprouts and few scattered eggs only for char kway teow or prawn noodle.
3) charged for every single box when asked to separate mee from soup for takeaway. When you did not make plastic bag availabkw for packing the noodles.
4) less than desirable attitude of the staff. That when you stand in queue in front of the cash register. They tend to ignore you and do their own cooking and delivery orders instead of politely asking you to hold on a while. This happened when I was at singpost at 1030an. Non peak hours.

In view of the above. My decision is not to patronise these stall any time in the near future. As for the price and portion. I have better options to fill my stomach somewhere else.

Thank you for scrimping on the portions thereby maximising your profits during this period.
Good luck for your business.",,,,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc3B6dEpBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Came on Thursday 5.30pm, had a line and waited for about 10mins to place our order.

We had the fish & chips, chicken wings w Cajun rice and mushroom soup.

My thoughts:
Fish & chips was the battered kind!!!!! Something to be mentioned as it is not common to find battered fish outside of restaurant establishment. The fish was rather thick and well seasoned, the batter was really light and crispy. The tatar sauce that came w it seems like self-made and was strong on the raw onion taste. It matches well with the fish. $7.50 for this battered fish and chips is a steal.

Chicken wings w cajun rice on the other hand was alright. The chicken wings was slightly soggy, but well seasoned. The cajun rice had a pretty strong smoky taste, probably from capsicums. It came w 1 slice of broccoli. Overall feel of this dish was meh.

Mushroom soup is really good, different from outside. The ingredients was blended really finely, so not much mushroom chunks (abit sad tho). However the taste of the soup is very yummy and didn't feel too jelat. I could probably down 2 bowls of it.

Now the business here has improved dramatically but service quality went the opposite direction.

The first batch of the staff were from Malaysia. They were humble and very attentive. All left now, possibly due to covid.

The current workers are from China and Vietnam. They have one thing in common: very rude. Especially the China national, just need to sit in here for 5 minutes, you can hear her yelling at customers telling them to collect the food, order verification etc. She even told customers that :""last time no customers, now I am very busy.""

The only good service you will receive is from the bosses who appear usually on Sunday.

The secret is in the marinate and the quick sear cooking that locks in the flavors while maintaining the tenderness of the beef which pairs well with the soy garlic sauce and the onsen egg ü•ö.

A few years ago, the stall was taken over by a group of young owners, and well, the standards dropped drastically.

I‚Äôm really excited that the original owners have reopened at a coffee shop opposite AMK Hub, about 10-15 minutes‚Äô walk away!

While most people ordered their value-for-money chicken cutlet, I ordered their Chicken Chop ($6.50) which is probably one of the best old school Hainanese western food I‚Äôve ever eaten.

While the sides like fries, baked beans and even the slice of garlic bread is nothing exciting, the star of the dish is their mushroom sauce.

Perfectly balanced, not overly salty, with hints of chicken stock and slices of soft button mushrooms, this sauce makes the long queue worth it.

Chicken was grilled well and lightly charred to add a layer of smokiness that compliments the sauce.

P.S. Don‚Äôt waste the sauce, use the fries to scoop up every bit of it! üòã",,,,

The egg contained prawns as well, too much for my preference but seafood lovers might like it? Gyoza skin is slightly thick and made using chicken as well, no dipping sauce was provided.

Worst thing about the place is the menu. First off, menu was only online and connection was extremely slow. Page took a min each to load. And.... It had no pictures.

So skewer chicken had a difference with grilled chicken... Although, because there wasn't any pictures... I couldn't tell what the differences were. And because there were no pictures, I didn't know what the plating was.

The beef hot pot stock was quite salty. The beef was sliced beef. Our guess is they are using frozen beef. When it came, a chunk of them were stuck together and raw when we separated them.
We ate a total of 1 slice. There was also canned luncheon meat.

Cabbage was crunchy and tasty with slight umami. Quite good.

The fried bun with pork was very nice. Slight porky taste. But still bearable if you are not sensitive to it.

So overall I would have to say this isn‚Äôt value for money if you are going for quality of ingredients.

Took them 20 minutes and to my dismay , they served me a SOFT BOILED EGG (a.k.a kopitiam breakfast egg). And for 9.90++, no Miso soup? Service isn't great also (no one speaks English, so good luck if you're a foreigner or Japanese and can't speak mandarin). Why charge service charge then? Been here a couple of times, been disappointed every time. Once, we ordered 3 type sashimi and they substituted maguro with salmon (they ran out of maguro), however the price remains the same. The kitchen staff kept glaring at me today for inconveniencing them by demanding the onsen egg. Hello!!!? Isn't it your job to prepare the dish according to the menu? I'm just amazed a supposedly JAPANESE food stall tried to nonchalantly pass off their rice bowl with a hard boiled egg (and they did it to several customers)!

If you're someone who appreciates homecooked foods, you should visit this restaurant and try out the food for yourself.

But if you're someone who enjoys alittle more of a sophisticated kind of ambience or even food styles (a.k.a atas/fine dining) then you may not enjoy dining at this place.

But for me and my family, we'll certainly come back and dine here again.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNllMVHh3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Review for : Take away for dinner. +  weekday dim sum buffet.

Dimsum buffet: Book and start the buffet at 3pm. As with everyone else, you'll be given an appetiser and pot of tea before the ala carte dishes is served in push carts. Going when it first starts ensures that you get a portion of all the dishes available as the service progresses. The dishes are served in good timing and don't rush to have multiple servings of each dish, unless u really want to, as there's new dishes constantly up until the 1hr20mins-ish mark where desserts start. Some dishes were a hit, (custard bun, red bean banana roll, char siew bao, siew mai, fish skin) some were mediocre (lotus glutinous rice, century egg porridge, egg tart). But otherwise, it's good value. Definitely worth it, had 20ish dishes between the 2 of us. We were super stuffed just an hr in.

Take away dinner: the lady taking our order was frank with regards to what dishes were good to order as take away. Generally, the food was decent, the duck was flavorful and tender. Radish fried kway teow was flavourful, altho the small portion was half size that of the small portion of the eefu. The sesame pork was a little disappointing, as it was just roasted sesame salad sauce with pork, not unique or memorable, can pass. * Note: takeaway orders have 20% off for almost all dishes.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX19xLTdnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"This is considered out of the way although a short walk from the MRT station. Luckily we decided on a late night dinner instead reaching at 9:30pm on a Fri night. Even then we can still see the remnants of the dinner crowd so would advice those who want to eat in peace and not wait too long to go before or after the peak hours.

We only ordered 3 dishes and all 3 feels quite solid. The drunken chicken soup was tasty and full of Chinese herbs. Both my dad and mum can make better soups but this is as good as it gets when you are eating out.

We had the egg omelette whilst pretty normal for tze char was done pretty well. The egg was not rubbery, and one can get a good bite from the other ingredients egged into it.

The pumpkin sauced prawns were the highlight we think of the dinner. One may be lulled into thinking this is a healthier version of salted-egg yolk sauces. I rather think this is a deconstruction of what is common place with something else surprising. The creamy feel of the sauce when one bites into the prawns is eyebrow lifting to say the least. And I can't help but wonder what is added to replicate the salted egg yolk but not kinda taste.

Overall is definitely a place worth checking out, if you have the time and patience to travel all the way (remember how crappy the red line is right now). The food will reward you for your trouble.

Though on 2nd thought, there is always this naggy feeling that the tze char store is as good as the chef is. And no chef and his team is permanent. If anything, I would savor the experience until the next discovery.",,,,

Love the al fresco ambience even when it's bustling with people enjoying the food with family and friends. A perfect get-together spot.

Mookata is essentially a hot plate BBQ plus a ring of boiling chicken soup stock around it so you get to enjoy the best of both worlds. Grill your meat with the pork fat given, and boil your vegetables in the tasty soup that has no MSG. Then, dip your grilled meat into their homemade spicy chilli-and-garlic sauce. Heavenly! I could eat this all night.

If you need more food, simply add on other dishes at only $1.90 to $2.40 nett. The boss goes around chatting with patrons, and he does seem like he loves what he is doing.

Icing on the cake would be the quality draft German beers the coffee shop owner sells right beside. It complements the mookata perfectly.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eWFDZ1JREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,3,"First visit, Vegetable Thali - It was excellent.
Egg fry was wonderful.

2nd Visit, Vegetable Biryani - Not to my taste and not like a usual Indian vegetable biryani.
Vegetable biryani should have vegetables (Flavoured rice or masala rice can't be named as Vegetable Biryani).

3rd Visit, Vegetable Biryani - Still the same but this time the side dish (Cauliflower 65 was mixed completely in dry so called Biryani Rice). This was not good compared to my 2nd visit.

Advice to customer is that know what you are ordering. No harm to ask people there about what you would get.",,,,

Will definitely come back",,,,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhb0xXZkh3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"The failure of including the longevity birthday bun (of great significance) for order of their celebration set. C'mon, how many of a 70s does a person have? Your terrible act has spoilt a birthday celebration!  A promised return call to be made by their supervisor took hours (claimed that they were very busy when I am told that the call will be made within the next hour) and it was near their wind down operation hours by then.   A slipshod reply ""we might have gotten too busy and we have forgot to pack in the longevity bun. We offer free desert at your next visit"" - is that your method of service recovery? Do you even see the point that you have ruined a celebration by missing out on the most important item?!  And the food was way too salty!",,,,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGFfYmx3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was, given that the store front looked rather assuming and there wasn't a snaking queue.

We ordered the set meal for 2 as we didn't want the hassle of deciding which dishes to order. The set meal came with 2 large bowls of rice, chicken, crab/fish (can't remember which) cakes and Tom yum soup. The portions were generous and is suited for a dining party of 3.

I loved the tom yum soup went very well with the rice and there was so much flavour. There were squid, fish and vegetables in the soup. The crab/fish cakes were not too oily and they went very well with the dipping sauces provided.

All in all, the meal was value for money and we'd definitely return again if we are in the area.",,,,

When my duck and Chartham rice  order was taken I was asked if I  wanted to add an egg or anything else so I added bean sprouts but I didn't expect a whole plate of beansprouts to be served so damage was $13.30.Would be better if staff could inform me. Beansprouts were quite crunchy but a little salty for my liking. The place is loud and the staff voices were very loud.  Not my first place to have a nice quiet meal especially when food is jsut avg,,,,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNEk3UnV3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh,4,A place where you can get many of Malaysia‚Äôs delicacies! And of which are up to standard and expectation. Would recommend Chendol and the pork cutlet curry rice. Asam laksa is not bad too!,,,,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpblBtZnlnRRAB,Uno Beef House,4,"UNO BEEF HOUSE is located in Toa Payoh along Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, at a coffeeshop under a HDB. Carpark is just beside the coffeeshop.

Beef Spaghetti ($6.00)
It was a spaghetti that was full of unpleasant surprises. The spaghetti tasted too soggy while the tomato sauce did not stand out. The real surprise was the mined beef as they felt like normal bolognaise. The beef was not unpleasant tasting but was just not outstanding from recommendation. Just a plate of tomato based sauce pasta with a touch of minced beef.

Mixed Platter ($12.00)
I went for the Mixed Platter which includes chicken chop, pork chop, bacon, ham, egg, fries, baked beans and a garlic bread. The pork chop was the only disappointment as the meat was dry, tough and was not well seasoned. On the other hand, the bacon was very flavorful and was crispy with a slightly charred side. The sunny side up egg had a really runny yolk which we gladly mopped up with the crispy garlic bread.

Bacon & Egg ($5.50)
Another friend went for the bacon as he could not resist, when the point was for him to try the pasta. Bacon was rather salt to have too many in my honest opinion but it was to his liking. It comes with two eggs, baked beans, garlic bread, coleslaw & fries. Nothing really fanciful about the dish. Probably something that would shine better for breakfast rather than lunch/dinner for the usual patrons.",,,,
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeHItZzlBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Clad in the striking palette of black, gold and yellow by acclaimed British designer Anouska Hempel, this is one restaurant designed with Instagram in mind.

Helmed by Executive Chef Sebastian Goh who uses only healthy ingredients with no MSG. Our favourite dishes include the braised eggplant, roasted duck and the XO fried rice. Each dish is priced approximately $40, so a meal is roughly $80 per person without drinks.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMFpyRmpRRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,Don't understand the hype at all. Food was average. In fact it was way below average. The other 4 or 5 stars reviews are probably paid reviews to deceive the public. Avoid at all cost.,,,,

Mashed potato and coleslaw is a superb, fresh and own hand cut daily. Salmon is crispy at the skin but soft and juicy in the inner part. You can still feel the juice bursting in your mouth. The only wasted is the gravy, they put it on part of my favourite crispy salmon skin. The pork chop is very soft and tender, not oily and the portion is huge at only $8.90. But the homemade pepper sauce, I really wish I can take away only the gravy. I can already smell it once I collected. My eyes turned very big when I smelled. The fragrant is really addictive. Can feel they put a lot of effort in making it! Gonna try other dishes !",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb3FPQWh3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh! @ Northpoint City,1,"Patronised the kuantan nasi lemak at the northpoint outlet. Staffs are rude and lack training. In particular, there's this grumpy middle aged man, kept reprimanding his staffs for every single matter. Literally shouting away at customers who ordered lontong that there will be waiting time for ordering that. Though customers said ok, the staffs would still repeatedly shout that it require waiting time to order lontong. I ordered the nasi lemak takeaway, instead of handing over the food to me like any usual F&B staff would, he appear to be throwing the entire packet of food in plastic to me. The nasi lemak tasted average, if you need a benchmark, it's lower standard compared to Crave. I'm taking my money elsewhere for future lunch.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejVhM2FREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,Honestly not bad if you're just coming for sushi and some other things if you aren't super hungry. It's obviously pricey compared to other foods but it's sushi and the quality of fish was okay. Salmon and salmon belly were the best quality out of what they had. Much better than sushi-go Jurong Point if you're coming for sushi. However the cooked foods here at genki was pretty lame and sushi go is probably better for that.,,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWNlZjJBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Let's be fair and honest, the food quality has dropped due to the inflation and the spike rised of food cost, I can accept it, the most is visit lesser since there are other alternative around the corner, that's not my main focus today.

Something I want to highlight and cannot tolerate with, is the attitude of the staff at city square mall. I am a regular customer of Fei Xiong Group.
I always patrol their stalls at different places all over Singapore, specially Encik Tan at Vivo, Malaysia Boleh at AMK Hub and Jurong Point, Nam Kee Pao at Grandstand and Plaza Singapura and Malaysia Chiak at  Centre point, all the staff I have met never show any attitude problems so far except the branch at City Square Mall.

I have had encountered a few incidents prior to my sharing today. It was a very unpleasant experience and affected my lunching mood each time.

The staff I would like to bring to the attention is the staff in charge of Claypot rice/Bak Kut Teh, this man is always very rude and impatient while serving customers.

The other one is the staff preparing the wantoon noodle and ban mian, skinny male Malaysian who simply ignored my special order and showing sign of attitude.

This was what had happened, I discovered that I was paying $0.90 for my takeaway, hence clarified why not $0.60. after knowing that charged per container, I decided not to separate my noodle from the soup. He was a bit unhappy but refunded the $0.30. What made me feeling frustrated was my curry noodle was ready,  but he told me the ban mian wouldn't be ready so fast but have to wait, fineüôÑ.

So I stood aside, while waiting, I only saw one customer collected the wanton noodle, no one else. Next one was my turn, question is, why would he wants to delay my ban mian? Why can't he prepare both at the same time?

The worse thing is, after I reached home, I saw that the curry has nearly dried up due to the delay on the waiting time and I also didn't get the breast meat I specially ordered which he promised to serve, instead I got a chicken wing with 2 tao pok and two tiny pieces of long bean, which I really dislike chicken wings. Ended up I added luncheon meat to go with the beehoon.

I had the feeling that this staff did a ""revenge"" behind the scene to his customer after being requested a $0.30 refund and causing some trouble to him. Obviously this is an attitude problem!!!

The above scenario was only one out of the so many incidents I had encountered and why should I not sharing this with all of you so that I am not the only one but you can also try to experience it yourself. Good Luck!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdmZyQTd3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"The best chicken Rice! There are many chicken rice stalls in Singapore  as it is a common dish Singaporeans have in our daily life. This stall to me, their way of making the Rice is the best! It is frangrance, not too oilly, and it packed in a bowl. You could simple eat it by itself without other dishes. The chili also very good! When people eat chicken rice,  another important factor is their Chicken rice chili. It is make with the chicken oil that come out when boiling the chicken and their special ingredient.  The chicken is tender and juicy, but not especially good. Usually they serve only the chili and dark black soya sauce, but you can and shold ask for ginger! This is traditional chicken stalls will serve. It blend very well with chili and black soya sauce also on chicken rice.

The other dishes that serve in the restaurent are well cook and delicious. They serve one traditional dish that is pig livers in clay pot, today you hardly find this dish. It is nice and smell really great with garlic. Another dish you may want to try is their deep fried toufu, its crispy and hot, it taste so good when u eat while it hot.",,,,

Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâÂåÖ($2.50 each), Êò•Âç∑ ($6) and ÈÜâÈ∏° ($10) are must try on the menu! Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ was nicely done, the pork belly was really soft and tender. Dip the fluffy bun into the sauce for a greater gastronomical experience! The crispy Êò•Âç∑ and its flavourful filling goes perfectly well with vinegar. ÈÜâÈ∏° was very juicy and there‚Äôs a lightly gelatinous feel to it. You can taste the booziness of the Ëä±ÈõïÈÖí, definitely better than DTF‚Äôs version!

We pre-ordered ÁîüÁÖéÂåÖ ($6) when making our reservation. Bite with caution as the scalding soup bursts right through the bun. My family loved it but I guess I just don‚Äôt enjoy pan fried buns that much.

We also tried ‰∏äÊµ∑Â∞èÈ¶ÑÈ•® ($3.50), my to-go breakfast when I‚Äôm in Shanghai. I absolutely loved it, even though it‚Äôs just wanton soup to most people.

Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖ($6), a tad bit saltier than DTF‚Äôs, but more flavourful with a more chewy skin. I liked it and thought it was better than DTF‚Äôs, albeit sadly, there‚Äôs no ginger slices to go with it.

Ended the dinner with ÂçóÁìúÈ•º ($2.50 each) and ÈÖíÈÖø‰∏∏Â≠ê($3). Loved the chewy ÂçóÁìúÈ•º that had red bean fillings.

ÈÖíÈÖø‰∏∏Â≠ê really fell short of expectations, cos my grandma used to make this at home. The glutinous rice ball was great (I love all mochis) but the rice wine was too diluted hence resulting in a watery rice wine soup. Could be better if it were more starchy and add more rice wine.

Overall still a great dinner and I‚Äôll be back to try the noodles next time!",,,,

Order is done via scanning a QR code and submitting your choices via a webpage. The buzzer on your table will ring when your food is ready for collection. Payment is made via a kiosk at the exit.

And also like their ‚ÄúSinglish Thai‚Äù signboard name.

And tell you what.. Their ingredients had caught me by surprise.

- Their Prawns & Scallops were so fresh, so fresh like it‚Äôs straight from the sea. Giant Scallop were bigger than our old sg 50 cents coin.

- I personally do not like pork alot due to the pork smell but trust me, I had so much pork than I could imagine here.

- Chicken were well marinated & savory. Tender & Juicy.

- Beef is Goooood. I cant have enough of it. OMG I‚Äôm hungry again writing this review.

- Soup base was FANTASTIC. Well broth with tint of sweetness. Unlike many stalls we went, starts with plain water.

- Mookata cant go without condiments. They provides 3 different type of dips or you could create your own.
Thai dip is good, goes well with everything. Traditional mince garlic chilli padi with parsley, my favourite. Another was abit sweet, mild spicy perfect for non spicy takers. Gosh, spoilt for choices.

- Last thing I would like to emphasis is the price. All 3 of us had satisfied tummies at just less than 50 dollars.

We had a GREAT time GREAT meal at Mookata Lor yesterday evening. I had it pinned and will DEFINITELY visit again. A GEM we accidentally found.

Could improve the acoustics in the restaurant though as there were not many people but it was very noisy. Good place to hold events but if it's so echoey it will not be conducive.

When we asked the waitress, she replied because they can use the round-shaped table, and wanted us to wait for another smaller square-shaped table, with the customers still eating half way and who looked like gonna take at least 15-20 minutes to finish eating.

There is a high tea dim sum buffet from 3-5pm.

The restaurant is spacious, have more than 50 seats and can serve large crowds. Ordering of food is done from the dim sum pushcarts when the staff pushes them around, told us what they have and asked if we want any. You can check with them if they have any of the items you want to order on their pushcarts. Staff was friendly and service was good and fast.

It is a nice experience to get the food like in the authentic Hong Kong dim sum restaurants, but you can't explore all the dishes as you do not know the menu / the dishes available and their prices. From what we spent, the dim sum is about $5.80 per item on average. The steamed items are cheaper than the fried ones.",,,,

The good: The food was of decent quality and the shrimp chee cheong fun had quite a lot of prawns in it. The average price of each dish is about $3.50, which is par for the course at a dim sum experience.

The bad: Despite the price, it isn't a full dim sum experience never it isn't a restaurant, but charges the same price. The operations are messed up with a lot of inefficiencies, leading to the customer collecting their food in bits and pieces (you need to collect it yourself - again less than a dim restaurant experience, where they deliver to your table) and the wait can be very long, depending on the dish - I had to wait for about an hour for the freshly fried red bean pancake!

Personally, among all the dishes I tried, the tofu bomb is the one I would come back for. The price and portion is reasonable. It obtains what seems like diced up pieces of prawn, possibly fish paste, chives and probably small pieces of chilli. It is flavourful with a hint of spiciness from the chilli inside.

Since COVID-19 CB, my family have ordered several times (if not weekly) for their tasty and affordable meal delivery. We were initially attracted to the fair pricing (think $5 for a Chicken Chop with delicious Brown Sauce, and 2 well portioned sides well packed in divider tray). Then there‚Äôs no turning back... we start trying all kinds of Japanese & Western food selection, and almost all satisfied. And for the 1 Sushi Tray which we commented that the rice texture is too hard from excessive pressure, this flaw is corrected immediately on next order. Very impressive business owner, who take feedback seriously. This is also the reason why I felt compelled to leave this positive review. They deserve to do better and survive current difficult wave. By saying that, I‚Äôm also helping those who order food deliveries on frequent basis. Their pricing is Very Affordable!! Especially if you live around their stall @ Koufu NYP. I reside in Sengkang and enjoys special discounted delivery fee at just $3 when I order in for my family of 4. Imagine $5 x 4 meals, add $3 for transport and that is just $23 nett for a good dinner delivered to doorstep.

Finally, I would like to recommend our family‚Äôs favourites: Chicken Chop with Brown Sauce ($5), Hawaiian Chicken Chop ($6), Mexican Chicken Chop ($6), Mashed Potato that are served with the mains, Oyako-don ($5) and the 8-piece Sushi Tray ($7).",,,,

I walked in it just felt so Korean I believe there were a lot of Koreans dining there. I was brought into the corner room where the other 2 tables were also Koreans. I was thinking to myself this place must be good and authentic!
Went with my gut feeling to pick a set and added a Kimchi pancake. Food was served pretty promptly and smelled good.
The dumplings was hot and crispy, very enjoyable. Then came the kimchi pancake and the jajiangmyeon. Am pretty surprised the portion was rather generous thank God we got enough people to finish everything.
Jajiangmyeon is definitely the best I have eaten in Singapore, the sauce is so good and not salty at all. 2 of us shared the jajiangmyeon and we were quite full already didn't really we still had the Jjamppong. Soup was not really spicy and it was very delicious. Didn't know why after the meal my lips felt like it was burning. Forgot about the main star of the meal which I thought was the sweet and sour pork. Wow the sauce is so good, so mild but has the essential flavours and taste.
Really enjoyable meal here definitely will make it to the often visit list!",,,,

And so, we have to wait too long despite the fact that we ordered first. The xiao long bao crabmeat smell tested not fresh and have many bones in it. Not juicy. Noodle portion was little. Fried rice tasted like no salt fried rice meant for kids. Dissapointed as hell. Just the name is big, but food not nice.",,,,

The service is atrocious, called 3 different staffs (guy with green hair, old aunty with short hair, prc lady with pony tail) at different intervals to check on my seafood noodles but none of them bothered to respond, just simply brushed me aside. We waited for almost 40 mins and my noodles is not served still. I now asked the 5th staff whom checked with the tall dark colored skin non chinese looking lady at cashier then informed us its coming. After waited for another 5 mins, the noodles just never arrived ! I was visibly super upset and proceeded to cancel order. The taste of their XLB is nothing spectacular, you are better off with DTF or Daxi @ Velocity which served better dumplings. Foods are NOT authentic Hokkien, nor authentic Putien, neither are they authentic Peranakan ! They have lost their identity, as rojak as Singapore. You have a better deal eating at real Putien franchised restaurants @ Ion, Vivo, Kitchener Rd. The taste of their food, and presentation is just about another wannabe Pu Tian, you dont even wanna see how they pack your food if you order via grab/panda, really dont even talk about service which is way below sub-par.

The char kuey teow was not bad. Except it was missing a key ingredient namely the lap cheong. Chinese sausage. Other than that, 70% alike.

She is very good, cheerful, proactive and experienced. She explains my questions in detail, and I like the photos that she took for us. The shots and angles are so nice. Dong Dong is very helpful too. All my requests are well attended to. I would like to compliment their service. The only thing to take note of is that they serve the dishes super fast, so you must not order all at once, as the table is unable to accommodate all the dishes at once.

Prata considered the crispier side which is totally my gem. $1.3 if I'm not wrong

The only down side to the place is that the teh tarik ice I ordered tasted very watered down even before the ice is melted into the milk tea.

I enjoyed the butternut squash soup, their signature ribs (fall-off-the-rack, hickory sauce?), Sausage (juicy!) lemon tea and colesaw. Apart from that, the sides of fries was normal and mashed potato a little too dry, the steak could be more seasoned and the mushroom sauce was just ok (maybe the other sauces are better). Other than baramundi, the fish used (such as in the grilled fish and fish and chips) was mushy but i guess you get what you pay for? The tiramisu was tasty and more of a well-set cake.

When they served, it was one quarter duck, and another plate of roasted pork and char siew which seemed to be able to serve 4-5 when there are only 3 of us.
And come with the bill of almost $43 for 3 of us! Probably the most expensive roasted meat that I have ever taken, other than Kam's Roast.
Some of the reviews commented that it is like black shop (ÈªëÂ∫ó) which I would not deny having that feeling too.
On a fair note, the food is not bad but does not justify the exorbitant prices.
There is a lady who seemed to be the lady boss, seated there and busy with her accounts (maybe calculating how much money they have grabbed), and with rather poor attitude.

One curry is the regular type served with  prata; it's not bad, but watered down. The second curry is loaded with spices, not the chilli or pepper kind of spice, more like cardamom and turmeric, etc. It's interesting cos at the other places I've tried that serves 2 curries, one would usually be curry and the other would be dahl.
This is my first visit to Meera's; and judging from the rather extensive menu, I suspect that their prata, while decent enough, is not their specialty.

I asked one of the female staff at the counter, the queue isn't really moving, what if we cannot dine in today? Can we get a compensation like a queue number for tomorrow? She answered, they didn't expect such an overwhelmed response. The queue started as early at 9AM this morning. There is no time limit for dine in so customers tend to eat slower, chit chat. They can't give me queue number for tomorrow as it is a first come first serve basis. I'm like? So you want me to come all the way here to try my luck AGAIN? I replied, by doing all these no one will want to even come back for such service. Long waiting time. Not getting dine in. No compensation. We overheard that the queue number got until 500ish till they stop taking in. At 9PM, we received a message from Sushi-GO that they are calling our queue. We can join Hungry Ghost Festival if we have waited till 9PM for our dinner.",,,,

Orr jiang was overly starchy for my liking. Sugar coated yam was fantastic! Just as I remembered when granny had made these many moons ago. Siew Mai filled with prawns instead of pork or fish paste was a wonderful delight, like ones you will find in a proper cantonese restaurant. Being very reasonably priced dining here makes it up.

No presentation the wrap was all stack up in a pile served on a side plate $40 standard I can‚Äôt complain. The prawn cake was nice and crispy. The hot and sour soup and braised shark fin soup was both very starchy can‚Äôt taste much of the soup base. Green veg was decent. The worst is their signature deep fried honey coated mushroom. Full of flour! Wonder where the mushroom go? The credit and saviour of the dinner is their O NEEE.... the yam paste dessert. Smooth... melt in your mouth.

„ÄãButashoga Ramen | Their signature shio-tonkotsu broth topped with hand-pulled pork saut√©ed in a sweet soy sauce and ginger was absolutely delish, I totally understand now why it's one of their bestsellers. The balanced flavours coming from the rich soup, saucy meat, sweetness from the braised bamboo shoots and green scallions was delightful.

„ÄãMiso Ramen | Such a hearty ramen which was infused with a generous amount of roasted Hokkaido red miso tonkotsu soup base, perfectly paired with the various toppings of sweet corn, slow-braised chashu pork slices, thinly sliced green scallions and beansprouts. The robust medley of flavours were simply delectable.

„ÄãTakoyaki | These Octopus Balls had a pillowy filling complimented by the mayonnaise, Japanese BBQ sauce and seaweed toppings. I took a mouthful and the flavours just bursted in my mouth, so addictive.

„ÄãDeep Fried Gyoza | Crispy deep-fried dumplings which had a substantial amount of chicken/veggie filling.

„ÄãChilli Crab Matcha Macchiato with Fresh Milk (New) | Being adventurous at heart, I instantly knew that I had to give this one a go once I saw it on the menu. It was quite (weird) unique and certainly not for the faint-hearted! Try it for yourselves if you're brave enough like me ~",,,,

That's what happened to my wife and I earlier this evening. We drove down to Sembawang to eat dinner at the Chong Pang Nasi Lemak place. It was closed.
We walked along the row of shophouses, and chanced upon this Indian restaurant.
We both love Indian food, so we walked in, sat down and I scoured the dishes in their counter and the ones in their menu.

Arabic rice, not bryani, I was told. Long grains of yellow rice with spice and raisins inside, accompanied by piquant, slightly spicy, super melt-in-the-mouth mutton in curry, and a bowl of my favourite Indian Tom Yum, rasem! Aromatic happy meal at its very best.
Wife had the paper thin, crispy garlic naan, with fish curry, and we shared some fish cutlets, cauliflower 65 (yup! Not chicken 65), and tau-kwa in sambal.
We're both so delighted we found this place! The food's great, the people inside warm and Very Friendly, and a dinner bill that didn't raise my eyebrows. Mind you, this doesn't happen too often these days, when everything is so pricey!

We ordered the Har Gao (standard quality - shrimp is pretty fresh), Beancurd Roll (a tad too elastic and starchy for me, but my mom thought it was good), Xiao Long Bao (nice healthy mouthfuls with very delicate skin - fair quality and taste for at $5.40 per basket of 3), Beef Brisket Congee (very smooth congee, and very soft beef - better than the generic lean pork century egg congee), Char Siew Chee Cheong Fun (I prefer the ones at Tim Ho Wan, the skin is smoother and char siew is of better quality), half an Irish Roasted Duck (fantastic crispy skin with well-roasted fats), Asparagus stir-fried with Scallops (no photos, ate it too fast!) and salted egg yolk buns for dessert (these come baked in a delicious thin crust and loads of filling).

I gave it only 4 stars out of 5 because they only informed us the Irish duck was not included under the Chope Voucher promo (we paid $35 per $50 voucher, basically 30% discount) only after we had ordered everything (and we declared we were using the vouchers right from get go) and was midway through the dim sum, despite the T & C's in the Chope Vouchers stating that all a la carte menu items were included in the promo. I did feedback to the staff at the end of the meal that this is something they can improve upon, and chose to use only 2 out of 3 Vouchers I had prepared for this meal instead.

4 adults and 1 child (who ate as much as the adults) cost us around $140 with a value of $170.

Will just have to come back for the Xiao Long Bao and the Salted Egg Yolk buns!",,,,

Didn't expect much before coming. I never thought that a Sichuan restaurant could be so delicate and beautiful. The lady boss is really awesomeüëçüèª

And the moment I sit down, I feel so comfortable, so casual, I can really sit there and work all afternoon.

Return visit so I could try their mala soup version. I had it medium spiciness and it was excellent. Almost addictive. More la and less ma, which I find a deviation of original mantra of Sichuan cuisine.
Nonetheless, it was excellent meal.

Had a hard time trying to find the place. This hideout had both indoor (air con) and outdoor. Good vibes and cosy environment.
A huge variety to choose from.
Ordered both the less- and medium- spicy levels. The medium spicy level has a good kick and numbness to it.
The must-haves are potato, lotus root, beancurd skin, cuttlefish balls and whole fish. They have other proteins such as chicken and pork but they do not label them.
Ask for the reward card which they give 1 stamp for every $15 spent.

Located in S-11 hawker center, which is the one just beside Jubilee Square. There is only 1 western stall, so it's quite easy to spot. One of the few underrated Western food stalls in hawker centers.

I've been here quite a few times and I must say I like the really generous portions and affordable price. A usual chicken chop at $6.5 gets you the chicken chop, fries, garlic bread, baked beans and coleslaw. Portion is easily visible in my photo.
I got the photo of the salted egg yolk fried chicken cutlet. Too fried for my liking, but still a sinful and enjoyable meal overall. Salted egg yolk sauce is a bit little, but it was quite thick.

The auntie used to be a bit rude since last time, and customer service was bad as well. But over the years I've observed improvement. And who cares about bad attitude, as long as the food is good right? (Cues those expensive restaurants with bad service staff attitude)

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMnBicnR3RRAB,Srisun Express,1,"1 masala thosai is 4sgd. Will you buy??? Simply not worth it.
Honest opinion, the food taste for the curries, mutton, and chicken chicken gravy are really good. However when it comes to the goreng stuff, it is tasteless. Basically Overrated and over priced. I do buy their food once or twice a month, as much as I wanted to avoid getting food from there, for some reason... i became helpless at times due to time constraint and it is the only mamak shop available at my area.
They don't have everything which is listed in the menu.
I usually don't dine in, as I stay nearby. But that particularly day I decided to dine in and Ordered the impossible Rogan Josh and a plain thosai. I waited 20mins with the thosai to eat it with the plant base rogan josh. I'm not exaggerating with the timing. I finished my tea waiting for the Rogan josh gravy, I received a plate of impossible roti John 20mins later, And the staff insist that it was what I ordered, then when checked at the cashier, they still kept my order which I wrote with the pencil on the order pad they provided. Found out that the Indian lady (new staff) keyed in my order wrongly, sadly No apologies extended..
A short guy with medium length hair, who i noticed been there with AMK Srisun for long from pre covid, approached. He ask the lady very angrily about the order and shows unhappiness even before I say something.. Honestly I wasn't even complaining when I had to wait 20min for the gravy, but what pisses me off was, when he replied me that they don't have the impossible Rogan Josh With his stern face he asked whether I still want the roti John or not.. I replied him that was not what I ordered..He said ok no problem, and start to process the refund and the lady at cashier keeps apologising to him. I was Worried the new lady staff at cashier would be in trouble for this incident and I told this guy I will just take away that roti John since they already prepared. I asked him to pack it. I also asked Him For some fish curry for my cold thosai. He immediately served it to me. There was no thank You or sorry which is what lacking in these service staff. I remember that I even helped Him by moving myself to another table when he approached me, since there was a big group came later than me, Who needed  the table to be combined.
Anyway this  wasn't the only reason why I end up in Google Review, but It is mainly because I often hear my mum complains that these Srisun workers are very rude.. And sometimes intentionally talking unhappily and sarcastically whenever my mum is there to get her food for work, which is very disturbing while waiting there. She felt intimidated by the way they talk and treat her, I hoping that  something could be done, hope they treat and respect all customers fair and adequately.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1XzVhd0R3EAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"Chose a chinese restaurant for our National Day dinner!

Has been recommended to this restaurant by many of my friends, we reach there early to make sure we can secure a parking space.

Yellow Pot at Duxton Reserve

We were very impressed with the Decor, I would categorised it as the Oriental Black Style but immediately after we settle down, we were disturbed by a group of Chinese Boys (tourist), tons of vulgarities and loud noise diffuse throughout the restaurant. Disappointed at their behaviour at such a classy and exquisite restaurant. Almost destroyed our dinning experience.

Let‚Äôs talk about the food.

We were informed that the food will take a bit of time to prepare and our first dish came out after 30 mins. But we were not disappointed with the food quality, the appetizer was Fried Prawns with Sesame Mayo, the big and crunchy prawn with the well-balanced Mayo sauce was a perfect match. This is follow by 2 soups, Double Boiled Chicken Soup and Crabmeat and Fish Maw. My wife love the crabmeat and fishmaw as it taste similar to her favourite sour-spicy soup. The chicken soup was great too, it comes with an abalone and it sure has been cooking for hours to attain this level of flavour.

The 2 mains we ordered were the Signature Roasted Duck and Fermented Red Wine Yeast Chilean Seabass. The duck was the purpose of this trip and it does not disappoint, crunchy and thin skin pair with the soft and savoury meat, simplify delightful. My wife love the seabass, it is a very small portion and quite salty therefore I would recommend that you pair the fish with some rice.

We also ordered the Freshly Peeled Crabmeat Fried Rice, with the price, I was expecting more crab meat but nonetheless, it taste awesome. You can eat the fried rice just on its own (without any side dishes).

Our dessert, Crispy Pancake with Red Bean Fillings, to my wife surprise, this was the best dish of the day. It looks ordinary but once you put a piece into your mouth, you will stop at nothing to eat the whole plate. It was that good! A Must Try

Rating: 8.5/10

If you are hungry for awesome chinese food with an amazing decor, look no further.

Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with Special toppings. Soup taste was excellent, with great collagen base in it. Ramen wise, the noodle is kinda thin, but does not lack the Q element in it, in fact it swallows rather smoothly, definitely great addition for kids and elderly. The aijitama (flavoured egg) have excellent colouring in it, which is surprising for non restaurant style ramen shop. The chasyu however is abit salty, but i guess is rather important for the broth. Taste similar to Keisuke Ramen. Overall, price is cheap and the quality is excellent. Definitely, a place to go if you prefer no queue, fast, tasty and a affordable ramen dining experience.",,,,

Food is good, except for the egg tart that is not those that don't have many crispy layers,  chicken feet is nice but can be softer,  I feel that they did not cook long enough, as for the rest of the dishes are good,  spring roll are crispy,  deep fried wanton is nice,  carrot cake with xo sauce,  century egg porridge,  fried prawn with mango also very nice.  I don't really like their chee cheong fan as the cha siew got a little bit of the pork smell which I'm scare of.  The cha siew bao is nice,  the lotus rice is nice too.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNGZUV0dREAE,PUTIEN,2,"Had a very bad experience today because of the incompetence of the service lady. I wanted to order large Lor Mee to ensure that it is enough for my family of 4 and asked if large is sufficient. The lady then advice me to go for medium if I am afraid we cannot finish. I then point to the menu and ask for the price of medium since I only see regular and large. The lady then assured me there is a medium but could not tell me the price even when I probed.

After a pointless exchange, we decided on large and thought that it means the large on the menu ($20+). When we were served, we were surprise that the standard pot was not big enough and our order came in 2 pots. At this point, I still did not sense anything wrong as I seldom dine in Putien and thought this is normal practice for large size Lor Mee.

It was only when I made payment that I realised the order was extra large and the price is not even stated on menu. I was so angry as I clearly wanted large. However it was too late since we already consumed the food and even take away the leftovers.

At the same time, we attempted to cancel a drink that we ordered but was not yet served. However, we were taken aback by the rude reaction from one of the service lady and her refusal to help us cancel the order. I have to compliment the male manager who intervened and help us cancel the order after he overheard the conversation.

I really did not expect such an experience and find this unacceptable for an established restaurant. Very disappointing.",,,,

At Wadori, each time I asked for more sauce, staff sure say ""it's gonna be very salty ya"". The initial dri≈º≈ºle of sauce is so insignificant, how salty can it be? (I'm not exaggerating, it's really miserable)

Then they will highlight ""additional sauce will cost additional 70cents"".
70cents for another miserable drizzle of sauce?

I hope u can improve on tis, dun make ur staff say the same sentences again, do something abt the sauce. If not, u can consider giving way to other brands.

The mushroom risotto was everything you would want in a risotto dish. Simple and rice was cooked just right (slightly Al dente but cooked through).

I visited on a weekday lunch there was no queue got immediate seating. Was quite cute there was a robot which showed me to the table. Way or ordering food was quite standard. Didn't like the table for 2 was really small and narrow.
Wowed by the menu. Didn't expect they had such a wide range of dishes, and the price was really cheap. Kept scrolling and took quite a while to order the dishes. Time taken for food to arrive was quite fast except for the Agedashi tofu, okay since they had to fry it upon order and it was hot when it arrived.
Was a hit for me for the food quality as I found them pretty good and satisfied. Nothing was not fresh or tasted bad and seriously nothing to complain for the price you are paying.
Things I didn't like was that the table for 2 was really small, so if you really order quite a lot of things you find yourself not having space to put the plates. They tried to consolidate orders by putting a few types of sushi in a plate but still the space was lacking.
Don't know if it's because of this the staff keep coming to the table trying to clear the plates. It was a mixed reaction because on one hand I found it quite disturbing wondering if the kitchen is lacking plates or they are trying to be nice to free up table space. I didn't like it when you are having a meal and conversation and the staff keep coming to disrupt.
Although the staff keep coming to clear the plates, when you need attention from them you just can't get their attention. They served the matcha cheesecake without any spoons we raised our hands for a few minutes before someone noticed us. Think it should be default to provide dessert teaspoons with the dessert or have some in the drawer under the table.
The only thing I felt funny was a female staff whenever she came to clear the plates she would always knock into something and go ""oh my god oh my god"".

This is nonsense customer service provided by Shirley. Utterly speechless by such uncouth manner.

I‚Äôd give it a positive review only because on both occasions I patronised, I hadn‚Äôt paid the full price: first time was with an eatigo 50% discount, the next was for their $14 set lunch.

2. Their wanton soup is of what you can easily get at the coffee shop for $3. The meat fillings were seriously pathetic and there were no seasonings. Soup had too much MSG.

3. Skin of the pan fried buns were too THICK

4. Sausage was supposed to be glazed, but it was very watery and the skin was 90% peeling off. There was no meat in the sausage and it looks dehydrated. My friend felt like she was having starch sausage.

We ordered salmon with fresh veg, truffle fries, nuggets (came with a small serving of veg), and a Hawaiian pizza.
The salmon and fries were delicious, nuggets tasted better than the ones you find at fast food outlets, and the pizza was soft and easy to chew, probably due to it being hand-stretched before being cooked.
Prices were reasonable considering the food quality and portions served.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aGRyZWFnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,"Very unpleasant dining experience at Lao Hero kitchen on 12 Mar around 6:30pm. , I booked a 6-8 seated round table at the back of the restaurant 2 days prior, with another 5-6 seated square table at the corner as backup in case of the former was occupied on that day. The manager of the restaurant told me she might not be able to secure the round table for me if a group with 6 or more people came before me on that day. But she promised that the 6 seated table at the back corner of the restaurant would definitely be reserved for me. I agreed and a confirmation message was sent to my phone afterwards. However, on the actual day, the round table was taken while the 6 seated table at the corner was deliberately split into tables for 2 and 4. Confused, I approached the staff and she told us to sit at the table near the door. After explaining to her about the reservation 2 days prior, she helped merge the tables together and let us sit there. However, the manager saw this later on and approached the staff, reprimanded her for letting us occupy that table, and demanded us to shift, we told her that we had booked that table and she said she was aware but still demanded us shift to the table near the entry door. My friend was shocked what was happening and demand a explanation and apology.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a1lUQ09REAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Extremely disappointed at the experience I had today, went there at around 2pm and was told by one staff that waiting time was about 3 to 4 hours and another that it was 4 to 5 hours. That seemed reasonable enough so I came back after 4 hours and asked for an update for how much longer it would take for my turn, the staff went to check at the computer and told me that it would be about an hour more. So I came back after another hour and this time I was told by another staff that it was likely that even if I waited till closing time, my turn to enter would not come.  I don't mind waiting for hours for the food but being told that it would take 4 to 5 hours and 1 hour more after I asked for an update, I would never have thought that I would not even be able to eat. In the first place, the management should have known that having this opening promo would bring about an overwhelming number of customers and should have set a maximum eating time like how genki sushi does it. I asked the staff why a maximum eating time was not imposed, the staff replied in a rhetoric manner asking me if I want a 30min time limit or a 1 hour time limit and told me they cannot control how long the people stay there to eat. I was also told that I should have estimated the waiting time myself, but I was already told by the staff that the waiting time was about 4 to 5 hours. Additionally, by 2pm the staff should have already been able to realise that they have given out too many queue numbers judging from the trends since opening in the morning and should have cut the queue number collection. My number was in the 200s for the 2 seater tables, and it was no where near my queue number near closing time, and to make it worse the last queue number is  almost 400. I am not sure how they estimated so badly the waiting time. The management was really awful and I am very disappointed.
To summarise:
1. not imposing a maximum eating time.
2. given an extremely wrong estimation of waiting time such that I was not even able to eat by the end of the day
3. not cutting off collection of queue number when it was very apparent that they had given too many queue numbers.
4. staff making it seem like it was my fault for not estimating the waiting time myself when they already told me that it would be about 4 to 5 hours

I would give 0 stars if I could, this is really unacceptable",,,,

Service staff Amy portioned our food out of our sight behind a pillar, so we don't even know if she indeed served us all the fish or all the noodles or all the orh nee etc.

She also ignored our feedback that our dishes were not served in the order we'd like. Noodles were ready as the 5th course when it should have been the 7th. We told her about it, she acknowledged and read out the remaining courses from our ordering chit and brought the big plate of noodles away so we thought she served it to another table. But turns out she just brought it behind the pillar to portion it out for all of us.

Also, a few staff served us at least 2 rounds of diluted-until-cannot tea until we asked to change the tea bag. Did they not see that the liquid they were pouring into our cups was clear and not at all brown?

And not sure what the staff were rushing for since we left about 30min to closing so it can't be for a next seating...my sister's plate and cutlery were cleared just as soon as she bit into a piece of pork, she didn't even have the chance to use her chopsticks to shift the meat to a more comfortable position in her mouth because the chopsticks were already gone as soon as she put them down on her plate.",,,,

Luckily, I am not in a hurry to do something today, and another auntie finally stood up, collected my food and beverage, and gave them to me (the food in my order is just ordinary ones, why took so long to prepare). But who wants to waste time on these tiny things, right?

Terrible attitude against all customers
1. keep talking bad about customer in front of them
2. not even bother to take order from customer (pity the boss)
3. keep messing up with customer orders, customer need to wait another round because of the mistake (I don't understand because all customer ordering fried kway teow only, and it is like just 3 to 4 orders, but you still can make mistake?) plus you did wrong but still showing attitude to customer? (pity the customers)
4. one of the customer in front of me asked for non spicy, the staff from penang prawn mee shout very loud saying that can not choose no spicy, but when i get mine, it is not spicy at all (just because you want to do all orders in one go, you tell customer can not choose?)

Not sure. . Maybe some experts can give their views...

On the other hand, the curry chap chye was a let down, being too watery and just not lemak enough.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd0ttdWNnEAE,Kotobuki,1,"I dont usually write google reviews for food places unless it‚Äôs exceptionally good but THIS RESTAURANT‚Ä¶

Decided to visit this restaurant after reading all the good reviews on google but it turned out to an utter disappointment.

Was greeted with a weird mouldy stench when we stepped into the shop and the interior is a bit run down. Staff were not friendly and made us feel that they don‚Äôt wanna work anymore lol.

All the rice bowls on the menu looked so generous so we were very excited, however upon the arrival of our food, we were shocked and disappointed. $26 for a palm size rice bowl? Ps, I have small palm so imagine how small it is.

Trying to stay positive, we told ourselves maybe the food quality really superb. After taking a few bites on their sashimi, we looked at each other with disappointment. Not only it‚Äôs not fresh, had a few with fish scale and bones in it. We then moved on to eating the rice thinking it wouldn‚Äôt go wrong. I mean, ITS PLAIN SUSHI RICE. To our dismay, the rice doesn‚Äôt even taste like sushi rice??? There‚Äôs no vinegar taste AT ALL. It‚Äôs VERY STICKY, I think it‚Äôs glutinous rice???

Miso soup tastes worse than the ones I get from donki and the soya sauce is so salty it doesn‚Äôt even taste like the usual sashimi soya sauce they serve in restaurants???

In the end, although the dishes weren‚Äôt cheap, we really cannot bring ourselves to finish the food. ITS THAT HORRIBLE. I love my chirashi dons and I‚Äôve never not been able to finish them but this restaurant really outdid themselves.

If you are looking for quality Japanese food, this restaurant ain‚Äôt it.",,,,

Three things I would like to talk about

1. Food and price

The food they served was fresh and delicious, especially their corn and marinated beef! Their bomb is the signature sauce, superb! I'll rank it my top three favourite sauce. My friends and I were praising the signature sauce profusely! Another innovation of them is to use butter to grill the meat, it was super delicious! Total price we paid after 10% discount was $52 for 4 pax. That's super worthy and even without 10%, it's still under $15 with your stomach full!

2. Cleanliness

Normally mookata place will be very dirty and unhygienic and oily, but they're otherwise, the whole environment is clean and not oily at all, table don't have any dirt or leftover food. Which we all were very pleased with.

3. Staff

Staff was super friendly and attentive, despite they have to attend to other customers, they will drop by to ask how's the food and if there's any assistance needed, and also offered to take picture for us. I will rate the service 10 stars if Google allows.

Even though the location can be very ulu, but it's really worth your time to walk in and try their food.",,,,

The purple rice in the yogurt can't bite the yogurt. The taste of yogurt is really too cheap. Buying drinks is so unprofessional. It's better to focus on selling hot pot drinks. More and more fans may spend a lot of money to eat what you want to eat. At least 15-20 can't run away. The package seems to be priced in the early ten dollars, but it is only enough to stuff your teeth. If you like fatty beef noodles or something, you can also update the staff. The frequency of replacement is a bit too high. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is slightly lower. The taste is not enough. The price is better. The taste is cheaper.

They did let us know that waiting time for food will be at 30 minutes or more. I think it is good that they let customers know that they need to wait. Hmm... but we waited for 70 minutes... AND even if there is lots of pre-warning or notification that food may take some time to prepare, waiting for 70 minutes for the food is not acceptable. They really need to look into streamlining the process or expanding the kitchen capacity to have faster turn around time.

Apart from that, please do make reservation ahead! With such a long turn around time from ordering food to serving, you don't want to be queueing outside waiting for table + waiting for food later!

The service of this place is good. There are many attentive young servers.

Food wise, it is tasty and unique. Some notable dishes are the Spinach Creatm Tagliatelle ($15), Seafood Aglio Olio ($15),  CCB (Cream Corn Bacon $9). We ordered quite a lot of other stuff too. Can look at the photos. Food wise, it is 5 stars.",,,,

Ok sure, they are old fashion, no paylah, no paynow, no contactless payment, in short only cash or nets, even with a paylah sticker there below the countertop ( which is misleading) The staff generated some QR code for my wife to scan but this turned out to be a dead end as my wife‚Äôs money got deducted but payment was declined. While this is common in many restaurants, we are not faulting the restaurant for that but it‚Äôs the attitude of the cashier that suddenly became very rude. First he threw the receipt at us saying ‚Äúlook, payment didn‚Äôt go thru, I also dunno coz it never goes thru‚Äù (then why generate it in the first place) .So my wife asked him for help and what can we do now?, is there any other way, coz the payment went thru on our side. He replied, ‚Äúthen you all just wait, I also dunno what to do, payment didn‚Äôt go thru‚Äù. His tone was quite loud and not acceptable for me. There are multiple ways this situation can be handled but raising tone and being rude to customers is definitely not the way.  So we went away and tried to call the bank while the staff just ignored us and went to serve other. I got seriously annoyed by this lack of professionalism and manners, and once we managed to get the money back, we left. Once again, they might have the best tasting Thai food in the world, but with that kind of attitude, I would not step in that place again. If you want to go, bring cash/nets, then probably the staff will be nice to you.

Might be a blessing in disguise. Went to the toilet, and on the way, you can see how poorly maintained the kitchen is, not to mention filthy. Might have saved us on a case of stomach pain/ diarrhoea. My advice for your management : 1. we are in the freaking 21st century Singapore, not some ulu kampungs , update your methods of payment for more variety. 2. Talk properly to your customers. Who do you think you are to be rude? 3. Clean your kitchen or at least put a curtain to hide all your mess from your customers eyes.",,,,

Ordered the glass noodles during my first visit. Not too sure why there isn't any sliced pork in it when it is clearly stated on the menu that there will be sliced pork. Ordered the jajang rice too. The looks of the jajang rice is pathetic. Just a plate of rice with a fried egg + the sauce. If I remember correctly the glass noodles is 18 dollars and the jajang rice is 15 dollars. Also ordered the sweet and sour pork. Pork hardness is inconsistent. A good portion of it was hard af and the rest were just nice. Can't remember how much was it but it's definitely more than 20 dollars.

Ordered jajang noodles the 2nd time I went. Not too sure what's the hype about. While I feel it does taste better than the average jajang noodles you can find in Singapore, it certainly isn't very special or unique. Also ordered some spicy garlic chicken. It's better than the sweet sour pork. Costs 35 dollars and it's not even the big size. It's small size which is meant for 2 to 3 pax.

Fresh juicy crunch on the vege, cook just right, retaining the texture and moisture. Snow Pea could used a bit of prep work to remove the thin fiber string on both sides. Portion wise versus taste and price, I would say this is worth it. Would recommend sharing for smaller portion eater.

Red Tom Yum Soup with Seafood, less spicy. I would say the spicy, sour and sweet balance would suite most. I‚Äôll should take the original  spicy level though. A bit too sweet for me. Anyway, Shimeiji mushroom are yummy and have the fresh juicy texture. Squid and prawn wise prep & cook well, tender and juicy to enjoy. Can see the good knife works and skill prepping the ingredients. The chef really have some standards, I would say. The squid could have a smaller bite size cut though. Less chewing and bite with smaller pieces.

Overall, a delicious well balance flavored meal. Which is pretty rare. Yummy meal. I am surprised, in a good way.

When making payment, we feedbacked the above to the manager on duty. He mentioned the following
1) Prior complaints have been received against Margaret by both service crew themselves and customers.
2) Margaret is a service crew, similar to everyone else, and not a manager etc. Hence, logically, she should be taking a fair share of the workload

Feedback for the service crew: Base on your seating capacity and staff strength I think you can render even better service , food arrives faster than the beverages and there could be more proactiveness from the service staff. Secondly I know the F&B sector is moving towards digitalization in terms of food ordering and QR code scanning but to a certain extend service staff can still hold onto a device to take 2nd and adhoc orders from customers as there should still be some level of tolerance towards manual food ordering.

The sweet and sour pork was too oily, we ate two to three pieces and it was too ‚ÄòJelak‚Äô for us. The pork was also not crispy and not appetising, the whole dish was ways off‚Ä¶.

The Jjajangmyeon has only onion and nothing else, it was also too greasy. The jjajangmyeon tasted and looked like those packaged Jjajangmyeon you can find in the Korean food section in Cold Storage. There are other restaurants in Singapore that serve much better Korean black bean sauce noodle than this shop.

The spicy seafood noodle was also a huge disappointment. The soup tasted like instant noodle soup. We ordered ‚Äòseafood‚Äô noodle but there was no seafood at all, there were only three pieces of cured squid pieces with lot of onions. The noodle was also not authentic and not freshly made.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN28ySnFBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank your staff (90787 Lee Yoke Chan) of the Northpoint branch.

We knew the crowd on a Sunday (15th May 2022) and we expect queuing for a while for a table of 10 pax for our 1st family dinner in 2 years.  After staying in the queue for 30 mins, Mdm Lee received us at front of the queue. She informed us that we will need to wait for around 1 hour plus as the restaurant had only 2 rooms with table that could accommodate 10 pax. She was very polite and even apologised for the long waiting time, as there was another family of 10 infront of us waiting for a table.

At around 7.30PM, Mdm Lee asked us if we would like to have a split table 5 + 5 as she wasn‚Äôt sure how long more we will need to wait for the next room. She was kind enough to offer us this arrangement as we were already waiting for 1.5 hour. We agreed to the arrangement, and while we were preparing to order, we noticed that the customer that was in the room had completed their meal and is leaving the room. Hence we asked Mdm Lee if we could change our table to the room. She kindly agrees to our request. We were told to wait outside the restaurant while she worked to clear the room for us.

While waiting outside, we heard that the other customer behind us (also with 10+ pax) shouted at Mdm Lee. They were unhappy that the room was given to us as we had already accepted the split table. They accused Mdm Lee of being unfair and they continue to hurl accusations, insults in Mdm Lee to the verge of tears. I am writing this feedback to clarify these points;

(1) Mdm Lee is acting professionally, and even so after continuous accusations and insults from customer

(2) Mdm Lee tries hard to accommodate request and provide solution to us and the other customer

(3) Mdm Lee do not deserve the insults and accusations made against her

(4) We were given the room because we were next in the queue and made the request to Mdm Lee

(5) We heard the other customer will be complaining against Mdm Lee, we would like to provide our side of the story

(6) We would like to thank Mdm Lee for her professionalism and apologise to her for the inconveniences caused to her",,,,

Even with this, service can be slow and inconsistent i.e., other people who ordered after you getting their pratas served first. Imagine waiting for 15 to 20 minutes only to get your pratas served cold to you.

Wanting to avoid having cold prata served to us again, we decided to strategise and go during non peak i.e., dinner. This time prata was served hot (thank god) as it was made to order BUT all the currys incl the curry/dal for the dosai we ordered was cold. They just can't get it right anymore.

What a disappointment. Its only downhill from here for Causarina if they continue to rest on their laurals and depend on their once good reputation.

There are much nicer prata, and prata curry around the area worth your money instead i.e. Al Rahman Banana Leaf Indian Muslim Food at block 603 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, or Sin Ming Prata at Upper Thomson. All the prata and prata curry is served hot. Theres also much depth to the prata curry!",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaU9xbURREAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,3,"Been a regular there as food is good at the place. But, there are important things to improve on (especially lately).

Have been there since pre-covid, it‚Äôs a simple cozy place. Food is affordable, tastes authentic and very delicious, always enjoyed going there. But recently, it has been disappointing on more than 1 occasion.

On all of these occasions, it‚Äôs the same problem - service. Somehow they hired someone new (note: the last time we went, she‚Äôs not new anymore. She should have been working there for close to half a year already). This specific staff always got our order wrongly, either forgetting one of the dishes that we ordered, serving dishes first to those that came in later or once even, serving our dish to the wrong table. The people from the table were unaware and touched our bowl. When we pointed that out to the respective staff, she took the bowl from them and passed it directly to us.

In a situation like this (especially when it‚Äôs covid period), shouldn‚Äôt she change the bowl to a new one before serving it to us? It‚Äôs basic hygiene standards. And when we pointed out that we were not comfortable with eating from the bowl that other people have touched it already, she and the kitchen staff started shouting back and forth in Thai language in front of us. And the kitchen staff even banged the table at the counter more than once while shouting or complaining. At certain point, even glaring at us. As if it‚Äôs our mistake.

Ever since then, I have never felt comfortable going back again. I really hope they improve on this staff issue. It‚Äôs such a waste when their food is really good.

Just a note, I have tried giving chances and returned to patronise the store after I noticed the drop in their service. But it just gets worse every time. We also patronise around near 8pm when crowd is slower. This didn‚Äôt happen when it was busy.

And no, I do not expect very good or impressive service. But just simple service like getting our food right, proper hygiene and proper manners.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb3VpRFJBEAE,Shanghai Renjia,5,"Here is my honest review useful to you:
I visited for the first time with much apprehension. I read the recent reviews of this place, and was quite afraid that the bad reviews were true. I felt uncertain but decided to take the risk at the end.

I booked in advance for a table, and I pre-ordered the famous Sheng Jian Bao (basically Xiao Long Bao but fried).

I entered the shop to a welcoming boss. Seated, and looked at the menu. The menu is very limited especially for a China mainland-hailing restaurant. These types useually have very large menus.

This is my opinion regarding the limited menu. I actually like it because it tends towards quality dining, fine dining. What do I mean? Simple, the harder it is to make dishes, the more effort it takes, the smaller the menu offered by the chef. Commonsense. So, I hope none of you ugly customers criticise them for this point. Menu is limited, but so what? Every dish is lovingly made. Many dishes are handmade.

I ordered quite a number of different dishes. Probably about 25% of the entire menu.

Here is my general comment on the food. How was it? Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. The noodles were handmade, and no, I am not just telling you it is handmade just because the menu says so. I can see and taste that the noodles are handmade. The shape, the non-uniformness, the springiness, the body, the texture. Handmade noodles.

The vegetables were cooked simply in fragrant oil. Excellent. Definitely novel to the usual ""HK Kai Lan"" or ""Spinach in Oyster Sauce"" in zichar stalls/chinese restaurants.

The Xiao Long Bao was good enough to rival Din Tai Fung.

But the main star of the show was the Sheng Jian Bao. I will not go into detail. All I will say is that it had taste and bite to it. It isn't just xiao long bao wrapped in a different-shaped bao. It is more than that. A Bao in its own right.

The red bean bun dessert was a very good finisher to an excellent chinese meal. Sweet but not too sweet. Very chewy bun.

I may not have described every dish to you, but I want to end off by telling you that from what I have tried, I can tell that this is a quality over quantity place.

Some commentators complain that the portions are too small. I say this: the prices are small too. Definitely cheaper than eating dim sum in expensive hotel chinese restaurants. If you think the portion is small, order more than 1 serving. Very simple. Very, very simple. There is quality in their dishes. Handmade noodles and handmade baos require a lot of labour effort, labour hours. You think they buy their Bao skin from a distributor then wrap meat inside? Of course they have to knead the dough, flatten it, cut it into small circles, and wrap meat and veg inside. Wake up, Singaporeans. You expect to pay cheaply for a lot of Baos?

Some commentators complain that the service is slow. I say this: it is run by a very slim crew. Their food is quality. You expect crazy, big-chain, 20-man kitchen to churn out your food? The consolation is that they serve your dishes once or twice every 10mins. So it is actually okay. It takes a long while for every dish to come out, but at least it keeps coming. They dont do one table by one table from what I observed.

Some commentators complain that the boss shows favouritism. I say this: You dont? I thought most of you are chinese too? ""Ka Ki Lang""? ""Guan Xi""?  So what if the boss likes to chat with regulars, and laughs with them? So what?

Finally, they serve free flow chrysanthemum tea. You can see the yellow flower petals in the jar served to you.

Amazing. Yes, the best chinese restaurant I have gone to. I think of the expensive, grand chinese restaurants.... you know what? They're different. Hard to compare. But this place doesnt lose out on taste at all. Not at all.

I wish them the best. I can tell they just want a humble, simple, quite life in this AMK enclave.

As for you, make sure you call well in advance to book your table and your Sheng Jian Bao. Simple. Ignore all the rubbish comments here from ugly Singaporeans. Call, book, then, go, and eat. Very simple.",,,,

This stall is mend by young hawkers and have been around the area for a few years now. The coffeeshop has a few other stall that sells very nice food such as curry chicken and Thai food, including mookata as well as western cuisine.

Back to the Loklok review. Comparing it to the ones that I have tried before elsewhere, it is one of my favourite. From the sauce that they use, the chilli options that they have and the freshness of the food, it has been great so far. Their choices of Loklok is also quite wide but so come early or you might not be able to get some of the favourite options such as mushrooms, brocoli and etc.

Cons:
We went there Sunday night, 19th September 2021, and there wasn't a lot of people but it was very chaotic. The staff were arguing (guy in yellow shirt at counter was screaming to the staff to ""open their eyes"") and there was a lot of banging of plates. It's a small indoor seating area so the noise was very hard to ignore.
We ordered a set meal with one mushroom soup(top up $1, the soup of the day was chicken soup) and one chicken soup and chocolate cake.
My friend is a vegetarian so ordered veggie chow mien and the mushroom soup. The older lady taking our order didn't write down any of our orders.
We were served two chicken soup and when we informed them, they didn't even realise that we ordered mushroom soup (keyed in wrong order, maybe can write down the order next time?)
The mushroom soup took about 10 minutes to serve.
Then the Chinese waitress served my friend ""chicken chow mien"" and when my friend asked if its veggie chow mien instead, she was like ""oh ya, that""
For dessert, the Chinese waitress served us yellow sponge cake and said it was prune cake and then said it was cheesecake? She didn't even know the menu... It was a regular pound cake (the type you can buy at giant supermarket) and we asked what about the chocolate cake the older lady told us about? And she said they ran out.... They didn't even inform us about it.
Food is edible. But the portion is questionable. Do Not order the pizza. Its $12 for a pan sized, those you can get for better quality for $5 at pizza hut. The dough was also RAW. Also asked for extra sauce because chicken was dry but was told have to add $1 for any sauce lol. This is the first place I've been to where I heard such thing. Other places like Aston don't have?
Overall, horrible service and bad atmosphere. Been here before where we were served by I think it was the owner, older guy with glasses, who was very polite. Unfortunately, this time, was a bust.",,,,

Yes, sponge cake.

Personally, I prefer my Donburi taste to be cleaner and that I can taste the freshness and sweetness of the fish. In this experience, we weren‚Äôt sure what we were eating. The fish though generous did not taste premium. For $35++ a bowl, a lunch for 2 could send you away $80+ poorer easily. That explain why the restaurant was practically empty.

Their chendol ice is so so good! Red beans were big and juicy. The ice makes it chilled and crunchy. The chendol is also soft and smooth. The coconut milk also adds fragrance. Overall it's delicious!

We ordered several dishes including the Chicken Hotpot, Griddle Cabbage with Pork, Spicy Fried Chicken, Tomato Eggs, and some assorted skewers.  Out of all the food, only the skewers were good.

The Chicken Hotpot was very disappointing, it was oily and the chicken were mostly chicken bones with little meat.  We ordered the Large portion but it was very little.  We had to add a plate of spicy fried chicken as there was very little meat.

The Griddle Cabbage was very oily, serving was small, and there were only 3 small slices of pork in it.

Tomato Egg was too salty and we needed rice to go with it.  We probably wont visit again in the near future, but if we do, we will probably only go for the skewers.

I paid using paywave and it did not go through the first time (machine fault or sth) bc the second time I used the same card for the transaction it went through. Cashier felt the need to announce loudly that my card was not working after the first failed transaction, whatever. During the second time I paid using the same card and the transaction went through (machine showed approved but cashier wasn‚Äôt looking) but right as the transaction went through, there was a power outage throughout the restaurant (second time within 20 mins btw). After the power came back on, cashier told me to tap my card again and I informed her the transaction already went through. I showed her that I already have a payment made to the restaurant (via my GRAB app), she kept saying it didn‚Äôt show up on her machine so I need to pay again. The fact that there was no transaction shown on the machine wasn‚Äôt her fault but her attitude was really terrible to be in customer service, she didn‚Äôt bother explaining or try to be empathetic. As a customer I already paid so obviously I wasn‚Äôt keen to pay twice and have to wait for one of the payments to be refunded to me. She took down my name and number and said she will contact her bank to refund the payment to me so I‚Äôll need to keep an eye out for that.

Upon ordering was shared that a number of items were only available in the evening and quite a number not available from the lunch menu (odd for a newly opened restaurant).

Waited close to an hour for our food to come, a family that arrived after us had ordered, ate and paid the bill to leave.

After a good long wait one staff told us that the rice we ordered can't be fulfilled as they have multiple orders in the kitchen (not sure why this was told to us after waiting so long and why it our order that was depriortized when we were the first few to come).

Food finally came, it was subpar some parts seasoned with too much salt and drinks too sweet.

Towards the end we checked on our takeaway item as well and noticed some back and forth- am assuming that order wasn't put in and that the chef just threw the ingredients together to make it then and there.

Shared our disappointment with the counter staff when paying and he told us the long wait was due to the soup my mum had ordered which doesn't make any sense because that was the first item to arrive.

First and last time here.

I only see 2 service staff during our visit. Not sure if the restaurant is understaffed because you need some patience to get their attention at times. Otherwise no complain about the service.

Food wise, the price is definitely on the much higher side and we were glad that the food quality and taste justify the price paid - except the dessert. Simple cake, ice cream and sweet red bean cost $15++ which I thought it‚Äôs way too overpriced. 2 simple appetizers, 2 assorted plates and a dessert set us off slightly above $100.

1) A5 miyazaki wagyu ribcap 120g - the beef was really soft & tender! Also quite fun how we can torch our own meat and add the toppings up our preference!
2) Crispy pork tonkatsu - Super good?! It‚Äôs crispy yet not oily and so flavorful! Better than tonkatsu specialty places actually...
3) Torched shime saba - super good too and flavorful! I also like how it‚Äôs fillet so it doesn‚Äôt have a ton of bones!!
4) Side dishes - the chuka kurage (jellyfish) was fragrant with the sesame oil, and potato salad is always a favourite!
5) Onsen egg rice (add on) & miso soup - I like how the rice has onsen egg and furikake on it

The Axe is a new western stall in the area. Definitely better than the one in 409 hawker center! Must try! Cheaper, bigger quantity, friendly staff, and definitely more delicious!

I ordered the Mexicano grilled chicken for $7.90. The chicken skin is crispy and you can tell it is grilled slowly with care, hence the 10 minute waiting time. The mashed potato gravy has black pepper and tastes yummy. The aglio olio is okay but very large portion even when I ask them for less. I chose salad over fries, but the lettuce is chopped roughly anyhow with too sweet dressing. Overall, very big portion and hearty and enjoyable. Worth!

The mexicano version has a lot of raw onions and cheese, I think buying the normal grilled chicken for $6.90 is even better.

Probably the first and last time I will order from this restuarant. Pizza base looked pre-made, ingredients are in generous quantity but the pizza looked like something you can simply whip up at home. Pasta was probably the only dish I might give a slight thumbs up for.

The ribeye was overdone. Salmon steak was also a miss (these mains comes with somd salad only, in case you were hoping there were fries as well)

Customer service though was a plus as there is this guy who would give out papadum to customers waiting for their orders.

I waited close to an hour for my order too.

We chose the 4 pax package. The hakka noodles and suan pan zi felt like it was pre cooked, instead of cooked fresh. The taste of the hakka noodles were abit disappointing in the sense that it was to the blender side. However, this might be because the other dishes are saltier and the noodles might be meant to be eaten with the other dishes.

The yong tau foo is really nth to shout out about. Average at best.

The Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ was towards the saltier side, but I really like the flavor. I would have given a higher rating if the pork was more tender. But some people like it that way. The chicken was nicely done.

Their chillis are a must try for those who are in for a kick and it really blends well with all the dishes.

Staff was courteous, efficient, and nice. One thing I really liked was that this restaurant serves Chinese tea or warm water foc. Which is so hard to find nowadays and something I really appreciate.

We had the tandoori set for two and used an eatigo discount for 20% at 6.30pm (only at Northpoint outlet) $25.60 for two of us plus two teh tarik. Impatient diners must note it does take some time for tandoori. It was a very good deal because the set was huge and most importantly, the quality was good. Chicken was well flavoured and tender. You queue, pay and collect your drinks. The buzzer system is a little odd. They ring you once but it is actually for the drinks which you have already collected. The second buzzer is the one which would indicate your food is ready. Good service at this outlet. Having said that, I am quite a patient and forgiving person.",,,,

There were people standing around the tables to wait/chope the tables. There were people queuing to order the food. You wouldn't know what to do, whether to find a table first or to queue and place order at the cashier. Just very messy. We immediately left the place and the group behind us pretty well did the same.

Went there again ytd, a Friday afternoon. Around 2pm plus which was already after lunchtime. Only a few tables were occupied but there were at least 3 to 4 tables with crockery uncleared. There was only one uncle trying to clear all the dirty tables and the used crockery after being cleared was placed beside the self service station for the clean crockery. The hygiene level, IMHO, was totally not there. The menu at the cashier was also stained w gravy and they didn't even bother to wipe it.

We ordered curry chicken noodles, assam laksa, two fried chicken. Assam laksa was quite good, the flavour was there and as close as those I had in JB. Curry noodles on the other hand was lacklustre, and the chicken pieces were probably 4 thin slices. The fried chicken was my least favourite, one dimension flavour tho it was served hot.",,,,

Also be prepared to wait 20 mins in an afternoon with nobody because the ‚Äúchefs‚Äù (management trainee) have no idea how to make the food.

Tried the fried Rice before. While it looks nice, it‚Äôs tasteless and flat. Very little meat also. Definitely not worth the price paid.

On top of that each chicken satay cost 70cent, and its really worth the bucks for the quality it serves.

So far almost all the dishes we've had are delicious. I've probably had 1 or 2 that weren't good but that's normal for every restaurant. The thin bee hoon and lychee pork ribs are staples for us. There is also a green juice that looks like a health drink, but I promise it tastes 10x better.

We brought a couple who just got married there, and the manager carved a pair of swans from a watermelon rind as a surprise. So sweet.

We had the noodles and congee as mains and they were just fantastic. The congee was well cooked and the taste blended in perfectly. The noodles were springy and the meat (Irish fat duck) was so juicy. Combined with their delicious greens and signature sauce, it is something you won't taste in hawker establishments.

Dim sum wise we had the harkau and liu Sha bao. Both were well presented but only averagely tasting. Har kau skin was too thick, and lacking in taste, despite the full filling of prawns. Liu Sha bao was cute but also lacking in flow ability and also buns were not fluffy enough.

Overall, it was a very good lunch and we would definitely come back again due to the friendly service.

Puffed rice went quite well with the latte adding some texture. Giving a cereal feel when it is soaked up with latte. Recommended to try. Speculoos latte is ok but hope that they can be more generous with the speculoos topping.

I liked the flexibility of being able to upgrade dishes from the cheapest plan to those that we liked better. I also appreciated other perks that were included in the package including the printing of wedding cards, wedding favours and free corkage.

Owen was an amazing coordinator who never failed to respond to my questions and arrange to things I require on the wedding day. Wendy helped me on the actual wedding day, leading us in and out of the ballroom for changing, as well as with the tea ceremony.

We were also able to book a meeting room at the Grassroots' Club separately for our tea ceremony which made things really convenient.

My guests loved the ballroom and food and we had an amazing time all in all.

Thank you so much for helping us hold such a successful wedding! Eternal Garden Restaurant has proved that you don't need to hold your wedding at a fancy and expensive hotel to have a wonderful wedding. Would totally recommend this place if you're looking for a small venue for 50 to 100 pax though they can probably accommodate up to 200 people too.",,,,

which serves up bowls of ramen at very afforable prices. Arguably one of if not the cheapest ramen you can find anywhere in Singapore as their cheapest bowl of ramen here goes for only $5.90 that come with an entire torched chicken drumstick!! I was in total disbelief. The torched chicken drumstick is also available as add on to other ramen at just $4. Also their broth are made in-house and is boil for 15-hours.

What I tried,

Shinjitsu Ramen‚Äôs Tonkotsu Special (S$10.90)
Come with four big pieces of sliced chashu, a giant sheet of nori, and one ajitama egg, which had been cut in half. The tonkotsu broth is smooth, rich, flavourful and not too salty. The ramen noodles soak up well of the glorious richness broth. The chashu has a delectable smokey flavour, my only gripe is that it's slightly dry but that‚Äôs just a personal preference.

Shinjitsu Ramen‚Äôs Red Spicy Tonkotsu (S$8.90)
Pack with a pile of spicy minced pork and three big pieces of sliced chashu. The little bits of minced meat added a nice contrast to the smooth noodles and rich broth.

(Add on) Torched chicken drumstick (S$4.00)
I choose to add this to my Shinjitsu Ramen‚Äôs Tonkotsu Special ramen. This large drumstick has a gorgeous sear on the outside and is fork tender soft succulent. Absolutely delicious.

Pork Gyoza ($6.00).
The gyozas here are handmade fresh. Generously stuffed with minced meat and spring onions, and each bite was springy and juicy with the skin being thin, slightly chewy and a lovely charred bottom. This is a champion.

Grilled Squid ($6.50).
Big chunk of squid. Soft and tender not jaw inducing chewy, and you can just bite through. Is amazing.

Very affordable yet quality not compromise. Is really value for money, delicious for the price paid and generous in portion!",,,,

However, maybe not get the thosai here. Not sure if the standard has changed but I tried that twice and both times the thosai took a long time, felt like it was made from ready made flour and came with watery curry. Prata was meh.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjRtRU1BEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Had been here a few times before deciding to drop a review for them.
The place is clean and well ventilated !

Most of the time we are here on weekend afternoon, slightly less crowded compare to night timing. There's aircon, so no issue even if you crave for mooks during lunch ~ Be sure to drink more water mannnnnn~

Staffs are friendly, but tends to get a little busy. So do give them more time for the preparation of your orders, or additional orders.

There's two type of choice for this mooks i believe. Buffet Style or Ala-Carte.

Most of the time, we will opt for Ala-Carte. Each plate range starting from $2.00 , if i didnt remember wrongly. On the pricey side, but for the location & air-con , acceptable la.

Love their minced pork & bacon cheese ~ The rest are good too, but personally skip black pepper, too heavy for me. But teriyaki pork belly is great !

There's also FOC ice cream for you, just help yourself to it.
Great fix for midnight cravings, open till 2am .

One pointers for all customers, do take note yourself on what you have ordered and no. of orders. Although as the usual practice, at most mooks, they will combine your no. of quantity into the same plate/bowl, sometimes there's still a few missed/overlooked orders. So if in any doubts do ask them, they are nice people so dont worry. At times, it happens to be a missed for our favourite meat, so we tend to realise.. Hahah, else i think its easy to overlook for everyone, too much selections too much orders. Just whack all the meat ! Hahah.",,,,

What we will come back for:
Onion Cheese Prata
Egg prata
Try a few more of their unique flavours

Pro tip:
Go on fave and buy their e-voucher. You pay $27 for $30 credits. Save $3! üòÅ

Their shop is relatively small even with outside seats I would say the place can only take a max of perhaps 40-50 people with safe distancing etc.

Thankfully we arrived before the dinner crowd and managed to snag seats in the air conditioned area. We got the side seats by the wall and the seats are essentially just concrete. Quite uncomfortable honestly.

The drinks came rather quickly and then soon most of the other pratas started being served up. They also provide curry as seen in the picture for free. If you want sugar with your prata you can also ask them to pass a bottle to you. In essence service here is pretty good even though they are extremely busy.

The onion cheese prata and the egg prata was excellent. Super crispy and tasty as well. Would highly recommend!

The plaster was quite meh to me and the dessert prata is similar to the chinese red bean pancake you have in restaurants except its much sweeter and also the red bean is not as fine and fragrant. I would give this a miss the next time.

Bandung is ok. Big cup is sizeable but because we make our own bandung at home we prefer it more gao with more carnation milk and syrup. This was a tad bit diluted for me.

By the time we completed our entire meal plus drinks our coin prata had not been served. Not only ours but the tables close to us as well. We thought good things are worth the wait... right? Wrong! We totally disliked the coin prata and ended up not finishing it. It was so thick and so much flour even though it was crispy it was just too floury for our liking.

Will we come back? Definitely! This place is right beside Springleaf MRT along TEL MRT line. See how I rated them on the individual components.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeC0yYVF3EAE,D'Rubinah Eating Place Pte Ltd,1,"Please avoid this vendor.

This eatery should be boycotted. Ripping off your money for unhygienic food. My Husband waited 45 mins for his takeaway order of 2 mee goreng and 1 nasi goreng thai. Extremely exhausted and hungry on a Saturday night, plus it was raining. We just wanted to taobao food home in peace.

The cook is from India, no offence meant, I am a local Indian. But majority cooks from India working in eateries here clearly do not know or do not bother to learn the local singaporean/malaysian mamak flavours.

Semi-cooked mee soaking in oil and the mee goreng sambal. No eggs, no veg. And the cook had the audacity to stuff the dirty paper receipt (which fell on the ground) into my mee. Contamination. Similarly, prepared oil and rice mix. Prawns were raw and not cleaned for the nasi goreng thai. I was grossed out.

Worst is the packer spills in lots of tomato ketchup, with no cucumbers into the oily mee. Why? I have no idea. Wonder how many people suffered from stomach upset.

Unbelievable mess. I saw many other customers having to remind them their orders.
We were charged $17 for this nonsense. We couldn't eat. Had to throw all away. Such a rip off.

I called up this shop the same night. The person in charge who claims his name is Raja was passive aggressive on the phone, aggravating me further, did not apologize, did not offer a refund. Typical, unscrupulous attitude. He doesn't even feel accountable for cheating a customer. Lack of conscience and ethics. Indecent.

I'm not sure how this outlet is still operating. Clearly the D'Rubinah management does not care despite the numerous complaints and poor reviews against them. They are simply getting rich by cheating customers. Customers (including me but no more!) are enabling these unscrupulous vendors.

Authorities NEA or SFA should look into this place. There's absolutely no hygiene, no actual cooking except slathering lots of oil into uncooked noodles, stuffing receipts directly into the mee. Lack of ethics too. I'm sad the hard earned money went to waste, we slept hungry that night, and even disappointed that the local mamak food culture is rampantly ruined. Real sorry state.

I'm actually furious that my 17 bucks was wasted at this place. No more patronizing at all the D rubinah outlets. Have shared my experience with friends and they too are boycotting this place.",,,,

Hear me out and I will explain.

I was there to order 2 plain and 1 egg prata at around 4.15pm. There were only one other male customer dining in at that time.

The female cashier kept on asking me whether I want crispy. I found it weird that she asked but nevertheless said yes. She asked a few more times to confirm and I said ""of course I want crispy"". I even said ""if you have freshly made, why not?"" And she never replied. By the way, tell me who doesn't want crispy prata, Right? And it also insinuate freshly made right?

But upon receiving the bill, I noticed I was charged 10 cent more for each prata. I quickly took a glance at the menu board above my head and realized I was charged the prata made of wholegrain.

At that moment, I knew I was cheated. Why did she not use the word 'wholegrain' in the communication? It was an outright lie to get people to buy the wholegrain prata when she said 'crispy'.

I confirmed with her whether she meant wholegrain when she said crispy and she admitted.

Even though it was only 30 cents more in total to get the 3 wholegrain pratas compared to getting the normal ones, but that wasn't what I initially wanted.

And because I'm rushing to fetch my daughter from school, I decided not to argue anymore.

It is so disappointing that the staff lied to sell the wholegrain prata which I assume might not be popular with the general public and probably trying to improve her own sales. It was plain dishonesty.

Please guys, this is a true story.. don't fall into the 'crispy' trap.",,,,

We decided to try the Thai restaurant, Siam Kitchen, which we had not eaten at before.
Placed our order for an appetiser platter and a seabass set. We got the glass of Thai milk tea that came with the set but was told we don't get SAFRA member discount with that set meal and so no discount for the meal. Disapppointing. üòü Just as well that we didn't order dessert which looks to me was overpriced. Ended up spending about the same amount I lost at mahjong earlier.
The soup with meatball was served with the baked potato. The baked potato still tasted OK but the soup was too salty for me so I didn't like it.
The appetiser platter had a lot of food. I guessed it can be filling enough for a full meal for some people.
The seabass was last to serve. The taste was OK but not something I'd missed enough to come back for more.
The place wasn't crowded throughout. Diners came and left while we were there and the number of groups was more or the less the same before and after our meal.

This is my second time visiting this place. They have different level of spiciness; local, Thai and super Thai. I went with the local version. Unlike many Thai food restaurants, their flavour will change with the spice level but this one maintains the flavour irregardless of the spice level.

The only downside is the fish. Tried twice based on different cooking style I guess they have still some rooms for improvement. Mind you, the fish is fresh and soft but I prefer it abit more crispy (deep fried fish fillet) and prefer a stronger flavour for chilli and lime fillet. Oh yes, you can choose either to order whole fish or fillet which many stalls doesn‚Äôt give this option.

I would still go back and try many of their other dishes because price for the food quality is a steal. Plus don‚Äôt have to queue to get a seat :)",,,,

Service really terrible from one of the female service staff. We asked for chopsticks but she says she‚Äôs busy. So we took from another table without anyone. Then she came over to scold us and said ‚Äúyou cannot take from here, we already lay out properly, if you want ask from me‚Äù. But we already did ask‚Ä¶? And she said she was busy‚Ä¶??? Confused by her service and action. Really not needed. She could have just replenish the chopsticks on the empty table without saying anything.

We probably have asked three different staff 4-5 times to please check on our orders. They all told us it‚Äôs cooking now. All the people who came after us have taken their food and left. We were really upset and told them  off. After that they checked and one staff said that the orders were missing. They told us they will cook now. It was such a frustrating experience, especially it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and all our old parents at home waited and hungry. One staff wearing an NUS shirt was rude, back faced and yelled in frustration. The service was so lousy. No one apologise at all.. all back faced us.. only one lady told us ‚Äúcooking now cooking now‚Äù. It was such a disappointing experience. Service could have done better by giving us a better service recovery or at least sound apologetic. No apology at all. Shame on them.

I've tried many so called
"" esoteric""  sotos and after now I reckon this is the best.

This Soto is more inclined to the Indonesian style.

Some of the prominent differences are :

1. The materials  especially the chicken is very fresh.

2. The blend of spices in the soup is perfect.

3. The portions of chicken is generous and not OVERLY Cooked. So it's very SOFT, TENDER & SUCCULENT .

So the combination is thus  perfect and they have also  successfully RETAINED a home cooked touch.

In the past I've a Malay friend from Kuala Lumpur who came and packed 30 + packets and brought it back by plane ( what an effort)

So its has to be good.

If you've been following my reviews you'll know that my comments are very Conservative and alway ""under promised"" & over performed, always way above what I shared and you'll not be disappointed.

Do go and try once and you'll be longing for the taste of this unique Soto.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NDRUUm93RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,1,"Having Chinese New Year reunion dinners in restaurants are rarely pleasant experiences. This year's experience was no better, despite a recommendation that Famous Kitchen's food was supposed to be good.

We chose the $318 menu for 4, and had to top up an additional $79.50 because its on a per pax basis and we totalled 5. No sharing. Fair enough, I thought.

We were told to be seated by 4.45pm as dinner will start promptly at 5pm. It started around 5.10pm when all tables were filled. We felt like we were in a Chinese wedding banquet. The food streamed in unison.

Salmon yusheng was fine. No surprises there.

When they dished out the crabmeat fish maw soup, it came in a small pot which hardly filled 5 bowls. It could have filled 4 nicely. And mind you we paid for 5 pax.

Fish was OK. No surprises there too.

Broccoli was over cooked. Mushroom was  soaked way too long. Sea cucumber was acceptable. Portion seems to be for 4.

Noodles was for 3 pax. No garnishing. Plain appalling and forgetful.

Dessert was sugary water decorated with bits of fungus and chestnuts.

Service started out fine, courteous and prompt in the beginning but ended up rushed. We felt as though the restaurant had run out of plates as they were clearing them as fast as dishes were served.

Sorry for the long post. For almost $500, it was outrageous and for a first timer visiting this eatery, consider it my last. I'm surprised a renown brand will wager their reputation to stage reunion dinners like these. Shameful.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbk03elpREAE,Rahim Muslim Food,4,"Malay braised noodles, or Mee Rebus is a comfort food since childhood growing up in Singapore's multicultural heartland. And tucked in the heartland of Singapore is this Muslim food stall of more than 4 decade's history moving from location to location over the years. On offering is a few basic dishes only, Satay from 230pm, Mee Soto and of course Mee Rebus their specialty. Menu starts from $3.50, $4.50 Power Mee Rebus or $6 Extra Special. In general, Mee Rebus is a yellow noodle dish, and most places offer them with bean sprouts, fried taukua, green chillies and hard boiled egg, topped with fried shallots. The star is always the thick, taucheo sweet potatoes sauce with rich umami. Different stalls uses different braising base from mutton, beef, chicken, dried shrimps, ikan bilis to even swimming crab as soup base of the sauce. Some has strong taucheo taste, some rich while some watery, and mostly too sweet. Hence at Rahim's their rich and thick sauce has the right consistency, not too starchy and not too sweet. Enough savoury umami to coat the sauce, ans unique to this stall, top with a coat of peanut satay sauce. And on the side, if you like it spicy, black chilli and ketchup manis to add depths to the flavour. Enough sauce to coat the chewy noodles nicely, and add a whole lime to give the broth a tangy twist. The Power version gets you tumeric flavoured boiled chicken slices, and the extra special gets you a whole chicken leg. The chicken is nicely marinated, juicy and simmered to the right texture. Enough to bite chunks off the chicken meat, flavourful and tender. Bean sprouts and vegs provide crunch to the dish, and my only gripe is missing fried shallots or would have made this 5/5.",,,,

My birthday party group of 33 were made to feel very special with good attentive service that was not overwhelming - no pushiness to buy drinks, although I must say the wines are so completely affordable compared to the much higher prices you pay elsewhere for the same. We were a bit noisy but with our separated dining area, I am sure nobody noticed.

Ordering is online via QR code and quite straight forward.

Waited for almost 20 minutes for our food which I think is a little long for ramen

I had the chicken based Ichikokudo Ramen (Extra Rich). Noodle texture was the best aspect of the ramen; stock was over salty and overpowered any chicken flavor. The chicken meat was not tender and stuck to the teeth. The egg was very ordinary.

My wife had the Hokkai Ramen Gifts from the Sea - Regular. The seafood was average at best. The stock way too salty even for someone like myself who likes salty food. At least the seafood stock wasn't too overpowered by the salt.

The iced green tea at $1.90 is a rip off. More like iced water with no green tea taste at all.

I went alone for my lunch and wanted to eat Penang food, but upon reaching there. It was packed with lunch crowd, I decided to eat at the china food stall besides it, as there were seats available. After finished, I thought why not have a Cendol, I politely went over to this penang food shop and asked one of the aunties if I can order from them and eat at the shop beside. One of them who looked plump rudely brushed me aside by saying.. ""Don't know, you go ask that china shop can eat or not"" OK, I went back and asked for permission and they said ok, no problem. I went back to order the Penang Cendol and said I seated at next shop.

The aunties started to gossip among themselves and very grumpy, grouchy about it. I told them the shop already said ok, since you told me to ask them. One of them asked me to pay up first in a rudely tone.. OK, never mind. I paid up and went to my seat. A skinnier with short hair and slightly grey hair bespectacled auntie came over with the Cendol and rudely said to me...""Next time, you come take yourself."" By the way, my table is just right next to their table.

Seriously! I paid up as per instructed and now i have to collect Cendol myself? and deserved your rude service? If can I eat at your shop, do you think i need to order from you and seat at other shop? You could have tell me not allowed in the first place and not showing me attitude.

After reading many positive reviews, I ordered a deep fried fish with rice.
The soup was added with milk and a  generous amount of deep fried egg, seaweed, tomato and leafy greens. Soup was good though not outstanding. 5 pieces of deep fried fish nuggets which were still piping hot. More crusty and it had a larger batter than the fish slice. Couldn't tell much of the fish type.
Aircon seating filled quickly but the  service is quick and friendly as they will try to get you a table at the outdoor (large fans were observed).

Try sweet and sour pork as it was highly recommended in  the reviews. Love that they use lean meat and the taste is well balanced and does not feel oily. Although the portion is labelled as 'Small'  I think it is good enough to be shared between 3 to 4 pax.

Black bean noodles is great üëçit is chewy and taste authentic. Portion is HUGE. I think 1 bowl can feed 2 girls or 3 small kids.

Kimchi is great and they are refillable.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbS1hYVRnEAE,TANOKE,5,"Room for improvement but a good first visit nonetheless. Found Tanoke on restaurant week's list and booked to try but ended going ala carte instead. Nestled in small cosy space on the second floor of a shoplot building at Purvis St. Chic modern interior accentuated with the play of light. Quite a few favourites but after having 9 dishes off the menu, I found some of the elements used to be repetitive. Would love to see more variation in flavour and style.

We started of with the otoro aburi handroll and they were accomodating to cook one of the fish more and shift some of the toppings over to mine so I had 2 portions of uni and ikura(in pictures). We loved the wagyu marmalade toast and made a second order if it. The sweet buttery finish on the crisp toast and rich umami mash of braised wagyu complimented perfectly with the dollop of yuzukosho cream.

Refreshing, sweet tomatoes and tart vinaigrette a top creamy thick mascarpone tofu. Love! It's like a fusion take on italian tomatoes and burrata. Definitely order this. 3-cut wagyu platter failed to make an impression. These had a beautiful smokey aroma when served. A5 Kyushu tenderloin, A5 Kagoshima ribeye and MB7 Australian striplion. Meats were cut too thin, 1-1.5cm thick. Tenderloin had the best mouth feel and melts but was cooked done, no pink probably as it was cut the thinnest. The Ribeye section we got was bottom half fat and some pieces with gristle. Striploin is forgettable.

Even grilling on the US jumbo asparagus. Bonito flakes and yuzukosho cream made all the difference for this simple dish. Koji aged NZ coastal baby lamb, semi-frenched. Appreciated the clean cut, less fat and well seasoned outer char. Tender and juicy without any gamey scent. Great if you aren't a fan of fatty cuts. One day air dried flying squid was overkilled in chili flakes and meat itself was rather flat. I wouldn't recommend this. Iberico pork jowl with sweet karashi mayo. Decent but again overkilled in chili flakes. The mayo helped here. Love that it was served with pickled radish slices on the side.

Nice jiggly matcha pannacotta with strawberry jam and pistachio nuts to finish off the meal. The  Smores Tartlet would have been perfect if not for the marshmallows being extremely chewy. I shared that perhaps the marshmallows were not toasted long enough to caramelize and melt inside, or the ice cream on top made them harden back too fast. The tart shell was perfect, thin and cracked easily while holding firm. Lots of melty dark chocolate at the base and bits of raspberry inside that brought it all together. This was waved off the bill after my feedback and the kitchen agreed that this could be improved.

Naren took great care of us during our visit. I was offered a complimentary sake to try and was served the Senkin Modern Moku Junmai Ginjo.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN0stVXVBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,"Affordable yakiniku place, however for big eaters may not be the best price(Big eaters may have to go for large rice[Upsize is free] and more meat). Meat is ok, ordered the Like set which has harami, short plate and tongue and ordered extra pork jowl. Best meats were the harami and pork jowl. The grill can be set to high or low temp, which is good for giving meats like harami a nice sear but not cooking it entirely to keep the inside juicy. However given that you are only given 50 mins i think most people will just set it at the highest temp. The grill is quite small, recommend going solo cause even if you go as a group you are still using the same sized grill, so 50 mins may not be enough. And because of the 50 mins time limit maybe hence why the meats are cut thin for quick cooking time. Same concept to ramen shops in Japan, you're going in for a fast meal not a social gathering. I would go again solo but if i we were to gather with friends i would go other yakiniku places.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbnNIM29nRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"I ordered the ‚Äò100-Second‚Äô Stewed Yellow Croaker on promotion for $8. The soup although little, is extremely sweet from the fresh fish. The fish is very soft and smooth with great texture but many bones. Not for those who are fearful of fish bones.

As indicated on their website, ""This signature PUTIEN dish is carefully boiled to precision at 100 seconds. It allows one to taste the true freshness of the yellow croaker. The original taste of the fish is accentuated, with the dish‚Äôs light seasoning of using onions, ginger, Fujian aged wine and Puning bean sauce. The perfect pairing of the tender fish with the sweet broth is best enjoyed piping hot upon serving.""

I also ordered another 2 seasonal dishes, Spicy Fried Duotou Clams (UP $26.80), ""Tossed over high fire, with just a touch of spice. A must-try!"" and Putian Farmhouse Clam Soup (UP $28.80), ""A traditional farmhouse recipe. Taste the delicate freshness of the clams in the soothing smooth soup."" Both dishes when ordered together is $43.80

Both dishes are nice. The soup is not too salty and I packed half the portion since I can't finish it alone even without rice. The Spicy Fried Duotou Clams is actually a stir fried dish. I decided to remove all shells before eating with the sweet garlic snd spring onions. To me, it isn't spicy at all, tasted just like a little light sprinkling of pepper.

The chrysanthemum tea ($3.80) is non-sweeten and refillable. I like it that they don't add sugar to it.

Overall, I had a quiet lunch as I went in before noon. The staff were polite and able to advise me on my selection how the clam should be cooked as they have 9 ways of preparing it.

The food tasted good without making me very thirsty afterwards. Be prepared to pay a little more for better quality food. I paid $65.45 for my lunch today. The portion is sufficient for 2 pax with rice.",,,,

1. Even before we were shown our seats, the lady service staff pre-empted that orders might take longer due to shortage of manpower. We didn't wait more than 10 min after our orders. That's more efficient than I mentally prepared for

2. E-menu showed certain bundled items as unavailable, but they were mostly available separately. Fernando patiently helped to take the orders and proceeded to serve our food. (Disclaimer: We took quite a long while to decide)

3. Service staff was able to acknowledge our request for help with a simple hand gesture while continuing to serve another table, instead of simply ignoring us.

4. We stayed till closing and all the staff were cordial throughout without ""black faces"" or veiled sarcastic comments.

Kudos to the team!

The Compoy with braised vegetables and steamed threadfin also left a lasting impression. Really liked the umami from the Compoy dish since most of the ingredients were naturally high in umami.

I think one very strong area for improvement is their service and attention to customers, which is the reason why I didn't rate them 5 stars. When ordering, we informed that one of our dining party was still on the way and requested for the food to be served later. 5 mins before she reached, we informed one of the staff to serve the dishes, but half an hour later, nothing was served. When we checked in with another staff, he had the cheek to tell me that we had requested for the food to be on hold even though our party had been there for a good half hour.

We also placed an order for the threadfin subsequently. However, 40 mins later, this was still not served and we had to check with the staff on the status. Because of these delays, we had to spend close to an additional hour at the restaurant.

While I think the quality of the standard meat selections was fair, the premium selection touted as A5 was below expectations. There was a wide variety of condiments for the choosing. Drinks were served right out of their commercial bottles. The interior is rather cramped and quite hot, thus not a place you would want to be in other than to eat and go. The relatively short timing (yes there is a dining window) also made the whole experience feel a little rushed. Do note that the buzzer doesn't ring and just vibrates.

Food was served within 15 mins. The mutton biryani was not so special. Normal and raita was not so good. Side gravy was sambar! Why sambar for biryani?

The only saving item in e platter is the mutton pcs which were juicy n gravy was spicy n tasty.

Mee goreng was a messy wet mixture of uncooked masala n day old fried chicken pcs wt bones. Unnecessarily spicy and its a raw masala soaked yellow mee.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dzctaV9BRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,3,"Had the Dinner Dim Sum Buffet.

It comes with abalone, sharkfin and a few other dishes on top of their free flow dim sum dishes.

However, not all dishes are worth the order.

For instance, prawn paste chicken tasted bland and felt more like a KFC crispy chicken with very very subtle/non-existent praen flavors.

Their charsiew and chicken, which si their BBQ roast, weren't nice at all. It taste more like a microwaved dish that's dried and weirdly flavoured.

Carrot cake was just average.

Sliced fish (with pork?), wasnt very nice as well.

But that's most of their bad.

So what's good?
Sharkfin literally had sharkfin in it, abalone was nicely seasoned and done. Fried beancurd prawn paste was unique, crispy and flavourful.

Their pork chop with chef's sauce is great as well.
Their spicy vinegar wonton is very nice, in contrast with the typical dim sum stores that barely had any filling, TungLok had it filled with prawn filling and very flavourful sauce.

Siew Mai were meaty and nice, worth the order for any dimsum trip.

Poached prawns are very savoury and fresh.

So is it worth another visit? Maybe? Likely not. It's refreshing to see their dimsum being served by the sushi trains u saw in Genki. But other than that, food wasnt very amazing.",,,,

Ever since it shifted to United Square, we have not try.

We came this afternoon and there was a Q. We waited in line for about 10 mins and was ushered to our table.

We ordered:

1. Chicken for 2pax
2. Mixed Roast pork & Char Siew
3. Prawn roll (small)
4. Sambal Kang Kong
5. Dumpling soup (6 pcs)
6. 1 plain rice
7. 1 chicken rice

Total damage: $54.15

Food reviews (subject to personal taste):

1. Normal chicken - doesn't give me the smooth texture or tasted succulent. Cucumber not even whole slices but within the big slice, sliced up even more

2. Roast pork tip didn't have that crunch which was disappointing. Char siew was little chunky sliced up and not much of charred flavour

3. Prawn Roll dish was decent for me

4. Sambal Kang Kong came out extremely salty and had to send back to change another. When returned 2nd time, it was still salty. Staff shared with sambal is such and is salty. We didn't want to comment much as for those who cook, is the amount of sauce/salt that a chef adds. Thus is adjustable.

5. Dumpling soup was decent
7. Chicken rice didn't capture the essence of chicken stock(if they use to cook)",,,,

Twice I've been here for dinner and once for lunch, and never once was I ever disappointed. In fact the portions are so huge for both our dinner set ($128++ or something in that range) and the portion is generous! I'm disappointed at my own shrunk appetite for not being able to finish my ricecovered in truffle shavings!

The wagyu, it melts in your mouth, the grilled lamb omg that char‚Äîgrill on it is perfect! The rice with the onsen tamago in it, and nothing but black truffle shavings on top, it's luxury at its best. And let's not forgot those appetisers that build up to the main course that you'd have thought could not get any better. Oh it does, it SO does.

I super love the sushi of uni, with ikura wrapped in crispy seaweed, with some gold flakes on top and a side of deep fried gobo shavings. It's all so good! And the portion, they're so generous with the uni that it's spilling out!

Let's not forget the dessert! The first time I was there I tasted their sorbet, not just any, but a shiso with Lychee sorbet, it's an acquired taste, but I so love how it cleanse the palate and makes you want to continue eating even more! The second time I visited, I had the gin infused jam with matcha panna cotta, speechless good. Its so silky, smooth and omg so wonderfully easy to keep eating it despite how filling all the other dishes before makes you.

If ever you need some drinks to go with your food. Everyone in the restaurant are well-versed in their knowledge of sake and could recommend good sake pairings for each of your dishes too. I love how intimate the mezzanine is, and it's just so cozy up there in the private space that I wish the night of fun dining will just keep continuing.

I'm always back for more, especially to try out their lunch menu, and omg it is so so SO GOOD! They serve mainly dons in the afternoon, but the miso soup is so good, I wish I could have just had more. And the staff are so kind to pair my grilled pork don with a glass of sakura sake.

To be fair, then it was still a private dining place, and it was more than 10 years ago. I was so wow that I went to the HK branch when I was over there.

Now it is just an ordinary restaurant dishing out boring fusion stuff. It's execution can be better as well. The only ok dish was the platter. The best is the soaked cherry. But this was an early creation since private dinning days, except that it has shrunk in size.  The rest of the dishes were so under-whelming. 1 star is for the food.

The odd sounding name has to do with them serving bull frog as one of their signature. We had the chicken hotpot and added ingredients like beef, noodles, and vegetables. Although we asked for less spicy, to us, it was still very spicy so for those of you who are not so tolerant of spicy food, beware!

We also ordered some bbq skewers - beef, mutton, pork belly, chicken üêî ... all were tasty and nice.

We will be back to try their bbq fish and also their signature bull frog hotpot.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ3ZpdDNBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Was previously an avid fan of obba.jajjang but after I visited this place!! I‚Äôve never visited obba!!!
Their price point is more affordable than obba $11 for Jajangmyun (didn‚Äôt take note for the tangsuyuk and jam pong) but other than it‚Äôs price it‚Äôs one of the best Jajangmyun I‚Äôve ever had!! (Even compared to those I got delivered to in Korea). You can tell that the sauce was home made (or at least I feel so) because it‚Äôs light and had a unique flavour. The jjampong also blew my mind with its milky seafood broth. The tangsuyuk is to die for esp with the portions and ingredients. I love the black fungus they generously added in!!
I think overall what I‚Äôm most impressed about is that most food I eat outside (obba included) leaves me thirsty however for mukkja amazingly it doesn‚Äôt!!

I even brought over my parents who hardly live outside food out and they approved!!!

Only have good things to say about this restaurant and would recommend to anyone who wants to have a good hearty bowl of Korean Chinese food.",,,,
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcXEzQmJREAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,Visited on a weekday night 8pm. Ordered the set for 2 pax with spicy fried chicken cubes. The chicken cubed was delightfully crisp yet tender to Bite into and were flavourful. The Jjampong noodle was brim-filled with seafood but atad more wok-hei for the soup broth would certainly have brought the overall taste a level higher. Jjajƒ´ang noodle was slurpy and gd to have nothing much to comment nor complain abt since nt much ingredients for this noodle. Overall liked the service and overall foodfare and reasonably priced for korean noodle place in sg. Total paid $60 for 2 pax that will probably feed 3 so will recommend if one is in the area and craves korean Chinese food.,,,,

We ordered the Tasha Special Murtabak ($15). It is FULL of ingredients. It has cheese, mutton, ham, egg, mushroom, capsicum and tons of other stuff. Surprisingly it goes nicely together. 5 stars here.

The mee goreng is the wet style. It spicyness level is there and it has nice chunky potatoes and tau kwa. It has a thick sauce coating every strand of the noodles. Nice!",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOEppQmRREAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,"Food is ok. Basically just Tze Cha food. Unfortunately the service standard needs to be improved. I get the sense that servers here are either highly stress or just unhappy with their work. There was no one in the queue. I was very very polite when I approached them but they were not welcoming, and seems to be rushing me to make my decision.

It was lunch time and I just ordered a one dish meal and again, they don‚Äôt seem to be please with my small order.

After seating now, I was asked to shift my seat due to distancing breach with their neighbor stall even though I was sitting in a seat marked ‚Äúallowed‚Äù.

It was so salty that I left without touching much of it. A total waste of money. To be fair, the Indian rojak was good. The rojak sauce either make or breaks the overall satisfaction.

The pork ribs were cooked just right and had plenty of smokey flavour. What let it down was the amount of bbq sauce - too little and barely having any sweetness. The meat marination also needs work. It tasted very flat. Just smoky and very salty with not much other flavour to give it depth so it got sickening quite quickly. Ratatouille was microwaved - film on the sauce and some parts of the dish were piping hot while other parts were not even warm. It marred the experience of an otherwise pretty decent side dish.",,,,

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejdUTEZBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"2nd table seated, but had waited an hour or more for food to be served. It seemed like they cared more about fulfillment of the Grab food orders since we had to wait so long. Even tables after us gotten some of their food first, this was made even more unpleasant with my hungry children.

What we ordered:
Basil pork with rice - first impression was terrible, serving of pork was also little, egg white was cooked too long as it was rubbery, though the sauce was okay. You can probably get better ones from coffeeshop Thai food stores which I used to get at Ubi.
Phad Thai - serving was small, really small. I also found the fish sauce lacking and this was supposed to be a chef recommendation
Pineapple fried rice - still ok, serving was ""average"". My kid could finish this, so it's ""average"" as there is always leftovers at other Thai food stores that we visit.
Fried Kway Teow with Beef - kiddo say ok not bad. Was alright but didn't tried the beef and once again serving was ""average"".
Tom yum (creamy) soup with seafood - ok, soup was the saviour. But I gotten a piece of squid that was mushy and was disappointed.

Overall, ok to eat but never will patronise this outlet given such waiting time for such food. Several better stores that serve much faster than this. Not hungry children friendly, but instagrammable with their signature neon sign",,,,

Happen to be running some errands around Tai Seng and decided to check out this place.  It was already closed to 2pm when I reached. There isn‚Äôt any crowd. Dish selection was quite limited as well. Managed to choose 3 dishes, Ayam goreng, stir-fried cabbage and begedil.  I paid SGD$6.50 which includes a can drink.

Food was delicious, Ayam goreng was crispy and it was topped with the crispy bits. Meat was tender as well. Begedil was also quite nice. Pricing wise, quite reasonable for me.

Found the price of the food quite expensive. Breakfast for 3 easily exceeded $100. They had a promo with Citibank but we had lots of problems with it as it couldn't accept applepay or if the credit card is stored inside the phone without the full 16 digits.
Order a few dishes to share, the one we enjoyed most is the Chicken and Croffles. Both croffles and chicken were well cooked. The Roffles platter was interesting because of the rosti waffles and also liked the way the mushrooms were cooked.
Service was very slow. Not sure if they forgot the order or what. The staff are all very young and had to call them over a few times to check the status of the dishes. The sides came almost last, the Spicy Chicken wasn't really nice it didn't taste Korean but the sauce more tasted like the Thai sweet Chili sauce.

Fried rice.. Sup kambing and nasi briyani. Mee goreng had nothing in it.. Just plain noodles with dark soya sauce.. Not even a stripe of beansprouts or vege..not even with sambal.. N yet tasteless at all.. We all were very very surprised n dissatisfaction with the food. Eat halfway n end up in dustbin chute. Haven't mentioned that each of the food was priced at 5-6 each. Sorry to say even hawkers economic noodles looks n taste better. Sup kambing was just spiced with water, only 4pieces of small cut of meat in the Sup..n not to mention was full of grease. Chicken Briyani rice just don't feel like it..to cut the bad time short.. Too harsh to say.. We hope you may cheat us that night... But hope that others will take note. That's our first and last.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbzdMX3RBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"Another visit: another one of those promo dish.. Fried duck a la orange... Absolutely scrumptious. üòä

Revisit: The lamb ribs isn't so good anymore... Sadüò≠
The meat tasted dry n leathery.. Rkn consistency is an issue.

Previous review: Typically I'm not a big fan of Aston. I eat at this location because it's convenient and I can get Safra discount. Generally the grill meats and pasta are so so, with the grilled seafood somewhat better.

Occasionally Aston do deliver some special promo dishes that's a bit more appetitising than normal, and this is what caught my eye... Moroccan lamb short ribs. It was pleasantly surprise for me as usually they tend to overdo on the meats but this lamb ribs is really worthy to command 4 stars. Nicely  charred, with a thick layer of yummilicious fats over laying tender and juicy pink meat. Grilled to medium doneness, the taste of the pinkish meat is simply delectable with natural sweetness and a subtle tinge of Moroccan spices (could be heavier with the spices if I was the cook). Leave the pepper sauce alone. It's too heavy and will overwhelm the natural taste of the spiced lamb. I must have had my month's fill of charred lamb's fats at 1 sitting but heck, it's just melts in your mouth. Too tempting to resist..YoloüòÅ, will take a couple of motilum when I get home.  üòÜ

As a purchase with purchase, I opted for the escargot baked in garlic/olive oil. That's brilliant too. Aston shd seriously consider make this lamb ribs a permanent part on their menu. I'll definitely patronise more frequently. At $19.90 a pop, this lamb ribs is great deal! üëçüëçüëç",,,,

One can never misse the Curry Chee Cheong Fun, either topped with shredded chicken or pig skin. The pig skin curry  is unique as we do not really get it easily here. It was deep fried then stewed with curry sauce which turned it soft yet retained the chewy texture. Curry sauce is really thick and aromatic. The CCF was tender, when soaked in curry sauce, one just cannot stop eating it until finished. The thin Hor Fun Noodle Soup has clear soup, mild chicken soup taste,  suitable for young kids who cannot take spicy food. Nasi Lemak is ok only, not really fantastic, the sambal is more on sweet side. Asam laksa is not really sour after sweetened. Broth is not very thick,  taste average. Curry Mee has the most generous portion with pig skin,  boneless chicken thigh pieces, tau pok and sliced fish cake. I changed yellow noodle to vermicelli which absorb the curry sauce more. This bowl of noodle is very satisfying and value for money. Coffee is not really nice if compared to the one we had in Ipoh.",,,,

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaXJic3ZBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),2,"First outlet to have a self service concept. BUT I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this self service concept is going to work.

What happened was staffs basically just stood around doing nothing. 2 staffs stood at the entrance, basically doing nothing. Another stood at the self payment counter, who tried to give instructions that isn‚Äôt clear nor loud.

Further back, you have more staffs gathering together, talking among themselves, or standing behind customers, asking them if they can clear their plates the second they picked up that last piece of meat to grill.

Food wise, standards aren‚Äôt exactly comparable to other outlets, the spicy miso sauce seemed to be a lot thicker and salter; the garlic miso was quite diluted. The meats also came drenched in sauce which made for uneven and inconsistent cooking.

Management needs to look into their staffs at this outlet. If they are already this unmotivated to serve customers within their first 3 days of opening, it does not bode well for their future. Either they need a new store management who know how to handle operations, or these staffs need to go for customer service and communications training.

My elder brother stays nearby for years and I have passed this store countless times. Strangely on the eve of his relocation, he suggested to dine here and he has never been here before. It was a last minute reservation (made 30mins before we arrive) and it looks a little empty for a saturday night.

Honestly I didnt harbour much expectations and ordered mainly the signature items which are less likely to go wrong. The dishes were promptly served and oh boy.. i was so wrong. The chicken soup is flavourful and though most of us didnt like chinese parsley and there was abundance in it, we slurped our bowls empty in no time (skipping the parsley of course) and found ourselves wanting more! The assam fish we've had before were mostly a tad too sour and this was amazingly balanced, the fish was cooked just right. Despite swearing to go on a diet, i had to have half a portion of rice to go with the sauce or I will sleep with regrets.

The final dish that came which sealed the deal was the signature prawn noodle. Gu ma jia is located just steps away from a famous prawn noodle available in single portions at a starting price of $5 while for this, the only size comes in a huge claypot at $30 but I will gladly choose this in a heartbeat. The broth is rich and yummy of course but what's shocking is there is wokhey. Show of hands, who had prawn noodles that had wokhey?

Lots to choose from and stalls display famous roads to state  exactly where the dishes come from. I wonder if this is really the case. Prices are not cheap. It‚Äôs like paying premium for the name and air con. Char kway teow could pass off as Penang char kway teow but lacked hum and lup cheong. Penang laksa was chock full of vegetables. Quite close to the real thing although I probably didn‚Äôt try this style before. Chendol had the right taste but ice shavings were not fine enough.,,,,

Average price roughly 16sgd(for 8 pcs sushi) and 7-8sgd for 4pcs and similiar price with udon. All menu has small or large portion, and of course the price will be different.

If you plan to eat dinner here, either make a reservation or come extra-early or you will not manage to get a table. Nearly every large table had a ""Reserved"" sign on it when I walked in.

The single and most important part of chicken rice has got to be the rice. What we got was a plate of undercooked rice that was bland as well. The roast chicken wasn't any better as the meat tasted dry and overcooked.

The Kang Kong and hot plate tofu were decent and the saving grace of our dinner was probably the prawn roll. Service standards didn't do them a favour either. Don't think I'll be back here anytime soon.",,,,

The gyoza is really the main star here, perfect meat to skin ratio.
Karage fried to perfection
For the tonkotsu broth, I find that it could be even more creamier.
The choice of ramen noodles wasn't what I expected. A thicker noodle would better complement the broth in my opinion.

I loved the smoked beef briskets, plenty of fats in this one tho. Not for the faint of heart. The bbq chicken has a good flavour, well grilled I will say.
Pork belly was a bit on the dry side but I enjoyed the flavour it had.
We had two sides, the ratatouille and the garlic fries. The fries wasn‚Äôt too overpowering, with the garlic taste just showing through enough. Having the ratatouille with the meats balanced off the meal.

They serve really solid la mian, xiao long baos and sheng jian baos (favourite). For a small restaurant, i think the items in the menu is just sufficient for them to run the store efficiently without giving much choices to diners.

in my opinion, i love the XLBs here more than other stores. Only issue with the XLB here is that the skin have not achieve the standard of DTF type.

Different outlet's chefs perform differently hence we have favourite outlets. Our first choice used to be at Holland Village. Another favourite haunt is the one at Ngee Ann City.

Recently, we've been ordering from their Toa Payoh outlet for home delivery. Although the experience is not as good as in-house dining, the convenience and quality of the takeout more than makes up for it.

My grandchildren love their beef so we usually order 2 portions. Another favourite dish we would order in twos is the four season beans. The lion head meatball stew is delicious but I prefer a more meaty bite. I find them a little mushy for my taste but perhaps the young children and older folks may like it that way. The tofu stew is also very delicious. I appreciate that they pack the sweet and sour fish sauce separately from the fried fish.

The food were served very quickly by  push-carts crews.  There were quite a variety of food to opt for.  We did not take up some of the food offered in order not to waste.

The chicken feets if cooked in a little spicy way will be best.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdXM2c2tRRRAB,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,5,"A surprise find along Neil Road is Jing Hua Xiao Chi. After the huge disappointment previously at the nearby Maxwell Hawker Centre for Wo Tie (Pot Stickers), a find just 5 mins walk away managed to wash away that disappointment.

Opened in 1989, this local homegrown restaurant specialises in traditional Chinese Dumplings and other Chinese Appetisers. All the dishes and Dumplings are handmade and not factory prepared. Decided to order some takeaway food to sample their dishes.

The Pan-Fried Mixed Seafood & Pork Dumplings were exquisite. The skin was pan-fried and seared to have a light crunch while keeping the juices of the meat within. When paired with the vinegar and ginger strips, it was so good.

The other item ordered was the Chinese Pizza. Yes, the name is somewhat misleading. It is like a cross between a Pastry Pie and the Pork Dumplings. It was an interesting dish and just as enjoyable as the Pork Dumplings.

From the above, this restaurant is definitely a go to place for future cravings of Wo Tie (Pot Stickers).

General Verdict: Traditional Chinese Appetisers done well and done properly for a wonderful gastronomical experience

Opening Hours: Daily 11:30am-3pm and 5:30pm-9:30pm

Queue Situation: Next to none but seats within are generally filled

Price: SG$8.50 upwards

Payment Mode: Cash and all Major Credit Cards (Physical and Paywave)

1)
Item: Chinese Pizza ‰∏âÈÆÆÁõíÂ≠ê
Description: Mixed Seafood and Pork Fillings in Pastry Skin. An interesting and enjoyable dish that is really yummy

But you can't beat the good variety of fried veggies, meat and seafood to accompany your mookata (23 in all). Although there is a minor queue when I turned up, the food is served fast (within 10 mins). You can choose from a selection of 4 sauces (satay, sweet thai chili,  sweet sauce and  homemade made Chilli). The place was rocking when I turned up (around 7.45pm) on Friday. The place attracts the young crowd and I recommend the outer sitting areas ( which is cooler). The place can get quite warm because of the many platters of mookata sizzling. I have chosen the mushroom set paired with a few odds and ends. The tare sauce with a dusting of white pepper on it enhances the nuances of fried unami. One thing can be improved is the rate of replenishment of the popular ingredients, the ingredients can be standby in the larger chiller in the back and quickly replenished in small batches as the night goes on. I happen to missed out on the eggplant üçÜ and fried fish because of that. But overall a good spot if you are looking for a platter of fried stuff and to nibble in a patpong soi vibe.",,,,

The food has been consistently good throughout the years and you get a good sense that the owners really take pride in their ingredients and quality.

I've also never had a dish here that disappointed me and when I visited today, the pork chop $7 was excellent, very tender and the portion generous. They also make their own coleslaw and this might be one of the best coleslaws I've tasted in Singapore (so none of that KFC garbage-tasting coleslaw). If you are looking for an affordable and filling meal, you can also pair their fried rice with a protein like chicken chop or fish.

But the pieces was cut rather huge with bones therefore tougher to eat with utensils. As for the spinach with eggs and clams, taste just so-so like any other zhi char. As for the triple mushroom with asparagus, it has a unique truffle flavour gravy which rarely found in other zhi char stores.

Restaurant was quiet; only four tables occupied. Was told that our claypot rice would take around 25 minutes to prepare. Lucky for us, it arrived earlier.

Ordered medium size claypot rice. To be honest, at $13.80, it does feel a bit pricey. Fortunately, it tastes okay.

Ordered a small plate of their San Lou Bee Hoon. It was a first for me and my father liked it. Yes. It's dry. But that's how it should be.

Customer service is what you'd normally get from a well-mannered Foreign talent from the middle Kingdom.

In conclusion, tastes okay. But if you factor in the price, I reckon it's a wee bit pricey. Parking and seating will most definitely be an issue during peak periods. Will come back again just to let my mother try the food here.",,,,

I ordered the Garlic Naan with butter chicken. Butter chicken is okay nice,
But It's the Naan that's special. Never see before naan is like that. Soft, Puffy yet chewy like as though got mozzarella but I didn't order cheese naan so it's not. It's just the texture of the naan that's somewhat stretchy like mozzarella , puffy airy soft like bread yet you eat and know it's still a naan.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyek5LS2FREAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Initially when I saw all the bad reviews about this place in Google and all the good reviews in Xiao Hong Shu, I thought this must be a case of non Chinese nationals disliking authentic Shanghainese flavours. So I decided to give it a try. I was wrong.

First there was the long wait, which is expected for a new restaurant offering Shanghainese food. We were a group of 3 and when it was our turn, we were seated at a table meant for two only. Just make do, we were told. If and when a table frees up, the waiter promised to shift us. Never did, even after more than one table frees up.

Food wise, we ordered the Sheng Jian Bao, Beef Guo Tie, Scallion oil Noodles, Chilli Oil Dumplings, Crab meat dumpling soup and Drunken Chicken. The dumplings, Sheng Jian Bao all tasted sweet without the umami of meat juice coming from steamed fresh meat. Someone in the kitchen took the idea of adding a little sugar, to elevate the taste of the dumpling filling, too far. The scallion oil noodles had too little scallion taste as the noodles was a disproportionately large serving. Only the beef potstickers and drunken chicken impressed, the former because it is a rarity and the latter because it tasted genuinely good. And I should know because I lived in Shanghai for almost 20 years.

Service was polite but inadequate. We were left sitting there to twiddle our thumbs for 10 mins without menu nor means to order using their QR code.

Rojak was decent, slightly on the sweeter side.  The vegetables fruits like radish, cucumber, guava were fresh and crunchy.  The youtiao had a crunch as well. The pineapples were unripe.

Popiah was similar, since the sweet sauce was the same base, over powered the salty fragrance that the cooked radish would have provided.

Lontong was rich and tasty.  The saving grace for the meal.  The gravy had the right richness and taste that made you want to dig in more.  The Tau kwa was generous.  Portions were right for 1 pax.

Oyster omelette was the first to order and last to receive.  The cook on the starch was poor and ""jelak"".  The oysters over cooked and the chili was ""off"" with a rancid water taste.

Their specialty hometown tofu had no special taste nor texture to it,and their fish slices with ginger were insipid and tasteless.
My all time favourite of olive fried rice was clumpy and yet superbly oily.

Understanding that drink and dessert will be served after your main course. Only our dessert arrived and we did not receive our drink at all (suspect that they forgot about it). When we rectified at the counter, they apologized and offered us can drink instead which we declined.

Ordered the famous carrot cake large size $4, took about 40mins. Not as nice as I recall and frankly even too salty, and this was after I had my other dishes. Wouldn‚Äôt have it again.

Had the large size $3.50 mee Siam, it was really good and I would be happy to have it again. Auntie squeezes the lime juice for you so you don‚Äôt have to do it yourself.

The tauhuey $1 was good but I didn‚Äôt prefer it. Though silky somehow I felt there was no more soybean taste. It felt like I was eating agarAgar or pudding‚Ä¶

Hokkien mee smallest size $5, was really good. It was flavorful, umami, good taste of lard without the porky taste. Chilli was not my fav but the base noodles itself was way too good already. Would have it again but it is a big portion for the smallest size.

Toapayoh HC is not bad. Was wondering why it was quite empty today but realised must have been because of the current covid cluster here . Lol‚Ä¶",,,,

It came with crab meat in the dish! Luckily the diner noticed it or she would have ended up in the hospital already!

Before that when I went to check if the fried rice was ready due to the ridiculously long wait, I saw 2-3 servers picking out seafood from a plate of fried rice (I thought it wasn't for my table hence didn't say anything). Hello, do you guys know what is severe seafood allergy & how serious it can be how?! How can you just freaking pick out from the plate of rice & serve it, misleading customers to think that it is cooked seafood free. But thankfully because you guys just picked out the crabmeat like that, the diner still managed to spot leftover huge chunks of crabmeat before she took more than one bite or all of us would have ended up opposite at TTSH worrying for her life already!

As for the food, it completely lacked quality. For the price charged, you‚Äôd have a better time at other more establish dim sum places.
