ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPamRpb2x3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Located at #03-05 of the mall.
Not that crowded even during holiday.
Wide range of options for the soup base, do take note that each person was expected to have an individual pot. The staff did mention that even if 2 people wished to share a pot, it was alright.
The food as fresh and the quantity was sufficient. The price was still considered reasonable.
The service was alright, but to compare with other hotpot restaurants, clearly it was lacking.

The joke was, one staff couldn’t even recognise me when I stood at the entrance after my meal. She still asked me if I wanted to go in to have a meal. And after I told her, that I just had a meal inside. She gave me the weird look."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeDZldndBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"A mini version of Beauty in a Pot, where each can order and individual hotpot. However, the good thing was is not like everyone has to order one hotpot, and two can actually share 1 too. No collagen broth but quite a few other flavours (more than Beauty), and ordered the ginseng chicken soup which was flavourful. The Tang O was very fresh and gave the soup an additional kick. Meat wise was also fresh. While I wouldn't say this is a budget friendly younger sibling of Beauty in a Pot, as the bill still came up to about $80+ for two. However, still worth to visit once in a while and especially if you are not planning in advance but kinda want it last minute."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM2NyR2J3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Two person ard 90-100$ after discount. Coz portion of meat is quite small, so need to order more portions. In the end overall cost similar to other steamboat restaurants. Food is fresh. Cabbage is not good all the root side.  Generally I prefer beauty in the pot under the same group."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybmVqQXZBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Visited at off peak hours to enjoy their 40% off food ingredients deal. Definetly worth it and their tomato soup base was definitely one of the best out there, and the food ingredients we ordered was good too as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtME9XRjd3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"A hidden gem on par with BIAP - this place is easily overlooked with a hole-in-the-wall entrance nestled between seemingly grander food options and we were really surprised by how it opens up to an unexpectedly spacious and cavernous dining area. The pork bone soup tasted EXACTLY like BIAP’s collagen soup and they even had the signature bean curd rolls?! With their 3-5pm 40% off it’s like getting BIAP for half the price. Everything we got was amazing as always for a restaurant under the paradise group; must order items include the bean curd roll, ebiko prawn paste and ramen.

Coming back for the 4th time on 28/3/22. Our staples for 3 ppl include:
- 1 portion of beef
- 1/2 portion of pork belly
- mushrooms: oyster, enoki, king oyster (not recommended to get shimeji as they swim around n get lost in the soup)
- pork and chive dumpling
- ebiko prawn paste
- 2 x ramen
- bean curd skin roll
- veggies: cabbage, tang-o
- condiments! My personal fav includes vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, spring onions and parsley."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdVpHeDVnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,Really love this place for steamboat! Really recommend it ! Products are so fresh and clean! The pork broth is really good as well!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNks2U1RnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Definitely my favourite Hotpot Restaurant with individual pot of soup🥰. U can share a pot for 2 pax too. All the ingredients are really fresh and most importantly, have tried about 4types of their soup base so far and it's all been really yummy especially tomato🍅 base. #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdTY3RkdBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,3,"We found the unit price of each food item increases quite a lot, almost 20 to 30% compared to last time we came about one year ago, though they still offered 40% during 2:30 to 4:30, for 2 pax, it costs almost 100 to get just 70% full.
The service is faster this time compared to one year ago, food itself is fresh and they do have Sacha souce that is quite rare to find in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHel9hZUF3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"My first time here, service 👍 due to service charge also, some customers will give tips after paid bills. When busy peak period, slower waiting time.....me alone spend $30++"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLXV6SlZnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,Tomato soup base is rich and flavourful. Sevice is great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaHVlY2VREAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Served with individual pot cook under portable gas stove which may taste better but it always ran out of gas for like 3 times throughout the dining.
Services are not comparable to HaiDiLao but prices are almost the same - may be slightly more expensive if it’s not for the member voucher used.
Food are pretty good and soup is tasty which is a good change from your usual HaiDiLao menu.

May worth consider visiting during non-peak hours which has a promotion 40% going on between 2 - 4 pm on weekdays."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcDk3YkRBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Spacious with soothing decor, clean and new, comfortable environment. Slightly different concept from their beauty in a pot branches as this gives you individual pots on a burner at your table. I guess it makes it slightly hard to see what’s in your pot and less options for soup base, but you get exclusivity! Also, they have kindly sorted into sets for the number of pax with all the popular ingredients (yay fried beancurd!) thus you don’t have to mull over what’s best to order. You can’t change any items in the set though.

The sets are really filling and gives you a bit of everything which is really nice. We took a 2 pax set $48.80++ and that excludes sauces ($2.20++ per pax). We added some beef and fried luncheon meats too. Water is not complimentary and chargeable at $0.30++ per glass refillable.

Their soup bases are similar (and more) as paradise beauty in a pot with the exclusion of collagen soup not available for sets. I stuck to my usual tomato (would have loved to have mushroom soup) but would try to be more adventurous next time.

Ingredients provided are fresh and the meatballs are really good and most tasted handmade.

Service is also polite and warm, with service staff constantly refilling your soup or water, and reminding you with little tips.

Do sign up for their membership to get rebates across their entire group of restaurants"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaWFIOHF3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"I’ve visited Paradise Hotpot a couple of times — it has a similar concept to Beauty in A Pot / Haidilao except each person has their own little hotpot. It’s also has a similar price point as the two other restaurants stated above, but the difference is Paradise Hotpot offers a really great promo (40% off the total bill if you dine at off-peak hours), which makes it quite reasonable.

I don’t have any complaints about the ingredients. The seafood and vegetables are fresh, and I also enjoy the innards (eg kidney and liver). My favourite soup base is the pork soup, but I’ve also heard good reviews of the beef bone and chicken soup!

Service staff are attentive so that’s a plus. Overall, good atmosphere and good food, and a pleasant experience! I’ll definitely come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeGRYYVRREAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Food was fresh and good. They had 13 soup bases to choose from. Husband had the Teochew Style soup. I had the beef bone soup. We both preferred mine over his.

There is a teatime special promotion - 40% discount. Huge savings off the total bill. Together with the ShopBack Voucher I purchased ($40 for $50 worth) we ended up paying $82 for a bill of $132."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdU8yTDVRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"I would say this is the best hot pot in Singapore for me. I tried the famous Hxx , althought their service is impeccable,  the food n soup base lose out to paradise's hotpot.
The soup base here is superb n the ingredients are so fresh. What's more with the discounts of 30% from opening to 2.30pm, 40% from 2.30pm to 4pm, they are much cheaper than Hxx too.

Love and recommend their

1. Authentic Pork Bone Soup Base
2. Bean curd ring
3. Because of the thick n delicious soup,
all other ingredients n vegetables cooked in it would taste awesome esp with the wide variety of side condiments and sauce at $2.2 per pax chargeable.  I would mix coriander,  spring onions, garlic, cut fresh chilli,  pinch of salt, sesame oil n some premium light soya sauce for the ultimate kick.

Complimentary sweet dessert after meal too 🥰"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMDYyOENnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"We tried four soups, tomato, chicken teochew and kimchi. Tomato was rice and smooth, sweet n tangy, great for kids and adults. Teochew was obviously good. Chicken broth was nice and light. Kimchi soup was not too spicy. Beef were all good, ad well as signature dishes. Everything was fresh.

Service was good, staff very responsive and quick to clear empty plates. Prices quite high though, three adults and two kids the bill came to $250"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cDhLNVVnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,3,There's something about trying a new place when they've just opened. We had a horrible experience at Paradise Hotpot years ago when they just started.. and we've avoided it ever since. But I came back today to give it another shot and I think they are a lot more competent now - but not spectacular. And given that the bill would have been ~$100 without the 40% discount during super off peak.. its a tad pricey.. don't you reckon? (and I ate alone ;)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdmRuMklBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,One of the best hotpot places in the northeast part of sg :-) you can share the soups too. The service varies depending on the server but 80% it's good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0aFBMcUdBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"We ordered the Teochew and Tom yum broths and they were delicious. 4 pax shared 2 broths and it was actually quite okay, cos the pots though advertised as individual pots, were a good size. They allowed us to add soup later on. All the ingredients we ordered were very fresh. The fish ball with fish roe was especially delicious. What a good satisfying meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMDRyb05REAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"The food is fresh, environment and service are great... Especially the taste of the soup 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdGJ5ZGlnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,All the staff in The restaurant are very friendly and helpful. The food are good and they have very good promotion during 2.pm to 4.30pm Daily. 40%off on all food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDd19ydjBnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"👍 for Friends and Family.
Love the ideas of personal pot as you get to try different flavours when you eat with friends or family.

💕Service’s quite fast, and the staff are attentive and friendly. Even though the portable gas seems to run out very often, the staff are quick to fix it.

🥩 Ingredients are fresh and very well presented with wide selections!
If your table ran out of space for the food, they will provide food trolley / cart for your food. My Favourite will be the Teochew Style Fish Paste & Beancurd Skin.

🌟Comfortable and relaxing environment.
Will definitely return again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbC1tX09BEAE,Paradise Hotpot,1,"Asked to top up drinks,asked 3 times never come never apologize.went cashier passed the bill with seat number n lost the bill still asked me where I sat.Told you n pointed to you where I sat 3x also still dont know.Your eyes blind or what?Never apologize too.Thats why your service will always lose to HDL.You all can only use discount to attract customers. f u.oh ya.and you all never bother to reply to complains.f u x 2"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPazZYaFlBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,Excellent service. Glad finally able to take condiments. Enjoyed the discounts for tea time meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeDhyR3RnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Delicious hotpot with yummy soup! I am always not sure why people prefer Beauty In the Pot over Paradise Hotpot.. It's essentially the same ingredients and somewhat similar soup.

This place is conveniently located at the 3rd story of Compassone. It can get crowded during dinner timings, so be sure to reach before 7pm and claim your seats!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNHNYMElBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Really yummy, especially with the current 30% of menu items during lunch. Recommend the fried rolled bean curd and the fishball with fish roe inside!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3RTUTdBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Good service but the prices has got up quite a bit. The hot soup based has not changed much through the years. Wished the had more local flavour like laksa etc..... We always go for the tomyam soup base. The personal pot style is expensive, to save money we always only order one small pot to share. Even with only one soup pot, the bill for two was over SGD80."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbDl0ZRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"I was not aware of this restaurant and it impressed me! Quite a varieties of soup base, I chose the sze chuan spicy and the other was pork soup.. lovely soup! Ingredients were fresh and at the sauces station, fried garlic was something I like! Refillable of certain beverages was via a constant walk around from the server.. empty plates are cleared promptly so that we have more table space! Pig skin and dace fishball was my fave!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvc0lyMGNnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"steamboat offering that is almost same as Beauty in a Pot. Price points is the same as BIAP and HDL. as we went during after peak lunch hour, it wasn't very crowded. restaurant was spacious and comfortable and ingredients are fresh. the current promotion is 30% discount for lunch until 2.30pm and 50% off from 2.31pm to 4pm. love the pork bone broth as well as cordycep flower herbal soup with mushroom."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOFlfOEVREAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,The 2.30-4.30pm discount is good. Ingredients are fresh and broth is also tasty. Love their mala broth.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbE43UEh3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"One of the first (I think) kind in Singapore with individual hot pot.

No need to share if you are particular about sharing.

Service is good. Food is fresh."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZ05XejN3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Food is good and price is reasonable, don't compared the soup with beauty pot. Individual liking.  2A2C, The staff told me I have to order additional pot for my kids but I saw other table come in later than me order 3 pots share by 6 Adults. I did not question the staff, I will order 2 pots next times instead of each per pot"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbHNXTEVnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Although the price is on the higher end, the food is great and service is good.
Definitely more worth the price if you go for the set meal"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNnN5MEV3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"One of the best hotpots I've had! The set meals are perfect! Great variety of dishes, so delicious! The broth was amazing too. Can see myself coming back to this place. Value for money ♥️ A gem of a find from Paradise Group"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvcU9ISjRBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Hotpot ingredients were very delicious and fresh! The soup were also very nice, very well worth the price that you pay for the food items itself! Even better, there is a lunch time promo where there is a 40% off for the food items that you order, this place also has Shopback Go support which is even better after all the discounts!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGNPbElnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,Price a bit too high! Service good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbk9xR3J3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Excellent service from Chunyan at Paradise Hotpot! She really went out of her way to rectify a mistake by the foodpanda rider.

We ordered the 2 pax set via foodpanda, and order came with only the ingredients without the soup base. When we called the restaurant, the staff was already waiting for my call, and explained that the rider had picked up the ingredients and left without collecting the soup base. She then got my address and cabbed down to my place herself to deliver the missing soup base. Very grateful for the excellent service and great attitude.

If there were 6 stars we would give 7 😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbF9ySFZnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Individual hotpot, selection not as much as ""beauty in the pot 美滋锅"", price about the same."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Z1lpTS13RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Expensive and feel not really nice. 2 of us eat dinner already $59.70
Nothing special."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcjVERDlBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,2,"Food quality is ok but poor service. Was there at 5.30pm, approximately 10 tables of guests. My 2nd order of food took more than 30 mins to be served. And it was after a reminder from me to check on my order. One of the waitress who was attending to me halfway scooted off to the cashier to bill customers. When she was done, she forgot she was attending to me halfway. She then went to push a cart containing soups and beverages around. Until she saw me at my table, she then realised she was helping me halfway."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdUl6bmt3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Good service, awesome food! The ingredients are fresh and the soup bases are delicious. My family's favourite...the teochew style soup...a must try. Lunch time promotion - 30% off. Good deal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdDdEMHRRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,My favourite hotpot place. The lunchtime discount is awesome. Can’t wait to go back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNF9YWGhRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,Good food as usual! 3 pax around $100
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd2VuVkRREAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Totally immerse with the Tom yam soup! Especially when days that you are feeling down, hotpot at paradise will never go wrong!

The best time to pop by are during lunch and tea time, to make your money worth while! since they are having promotions! But not to fear, always call to make reservation for weekend dinners (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

Did a company event here years back and the service is really 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻. As a fan of hotpot, I will recommend here as compare to those Buffet style. Good food, good service, worth coming!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaWRqd0JnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,1,"Service was bad. Food was worse. Had pork broth and tomato corn soup base and they were not good. I thought the Paradise brand prides itself for being a top player in the market. Well, this truly was disappointing. Water had sand grains at the bottom of the glass, and when asked about it, the wait staff couldn't explain and hey, no apology was given. I couldn't even make out what they served for dessert. Not coming back to this outlet for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbHBmNzhRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Good atmosphere, good quality of food. You pay for what you get. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaGIzZUFREAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,Same group as the beauty in the pot.... ingredients similar with similar pricing... but have discount ranging from 30 to 40%. Service level not as good as beauty in the pot. Very different soup base.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbnJiV1FBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,1,"Another table left early, when I pay for both table the cashier argued say the other table got 3 sauces and can even name the sauces. Already told them no sauce, once I cally mum ask them, it is no sauce, they suddenly say yaya no sauce... Trying to cheat money!!!"

It’s also has a similar price point as the two other restaurants stated above, but the difference is Paradise Hotpot offers a really great promo (40% off the total bill if you dine at off-peak hours), which makes it quite reasonable.

I don’t have any complaints about the ingredients. The seafood and vegetables are fresh, and I also enjoy the innards (eg kidney and liver). My favourite soup base is the pork soup, but I’ve also heard good reviews of the beef bone and chicken soup!

Service staff are attentive so that’s a plus. Overall, good atmosphere and good food, and a pleasant experience! I’ll definitely come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeGRYYVRREAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Food was fresh and good. They had 13 soup bases to choose from. Husband had the Teochew Style soup. I had the beef bone soup. We both preferred mine over his.

There is a teatime special promotion - 40% discount. Huge savings off the total bill. Together with the ShopBack Voucher I purchased ($40 for $50 worth) we ended up paying $82 for a bill of $132."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdU8yTDVRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"I would say this is the best hot pot in Singapore for me. I tried the famous Hxx , althought their service is impeccable,  the food n soup base lose out to paradise's hotpot.
The soup base here is superb n the ingredients are so fresh. What's more with the discounts of 30% from opening to 2.30pm, 40% from 2.30pm to 4pm, they are much cheaper than Hxx too.

Love and recommend their

1. Authentic Pork Bone Soup Base
2. Bean curd ring
3. Because of the thick n delicious soup,
all other ingredients n vegetables cooked in it would taste awesome esp with the wide variety of side condiments and sauce at $2.2 per pax chargeable.  I would mix coriander,  spring onions, garlic, cut fresh chilli,  pinch of salt, sesame oil n some premium light soya sauce for the ultimate kick.

Complimentary sweet dessert after meal too 🥰"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMDYyOENnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"We tried four soups, tomato, chicken teochew and kimchi. Tomato was rice and smooth, sweet n tangy, great for kids and adults. Teochew was obviously good. Chicken broth was nice and light. Kimchi soup was not too spicy. Beef were all good, ad well as signature dishes. Everything was fresh.

Service was good, staff very responsive and quick to clear empty plates. Prices quite high though, three adults and two kids the bill came to $250"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cDhLNVVnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,3,There's something about trying a new place when they've just opened. We had a horrible experience at Paradise Hotpot years ago when they just started.. and we've avoided it ever since. But I came back today to give it another shot and I think they are a lot more competent now - but not spectacular. And given that the bill would have been ~$100 without the 40% discount during super off peak.. its a tad pricey.. don't you reckon? (and I ate alone ;)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdmRuMklBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,One of the best hotpot places in the northeast part of sg :-) you can share the soups too. The service varies depending on the server but 80% it's good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0aFBMcUdBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"We ordered the Teochew and Tom yum broths and they were delicious. 4 pax shared 2 broths and it was actually quite okay, cos the pots though advertised as individual pots, were a good size. They allowed us to add soup later on. All the ingredients we ordered were very fresh. The fish ball with fish roe was especially delicious. What a good satisfying meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMDRyb05REAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"The food is fresh, environment and service are great... Especially the taste of the soup 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdGJ5ZGlnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,All the staff in The restaurant are very friendly and helpful. The food are good and they have very good promotion during 2.pm to 4.30pm Daily. 40%off on all food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDd19ydjBnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"👍 for Friends and Family.
Love the ideas of personal pot as you get to try different flavours when you eat with friends or family.

💕Service’s quite fast, and the staff are attentive and friendly. Even though the portable gas seems to run out very often, the staff are quick to fix it.

🥩 Ingredients are fresh and very well presented with wide selections!
If your table ran out of space for the food, they will provide food trolley / cart for your food. My Favourite will be the Teochew Style Fish Paste & Beancurd Skin.

🌟Comfortable and relaxing environment.
Will definitely return again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPazZYaFlBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,Excellent service. Glad finally able to take condiments. Enjoyed the discounts for tea time meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeDhyR3RnRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Delicious hotpot with yummy soup! I am always not sure why people prefer Beauty In the Pot over Paradise Hotpot.. It's essentially the same ingredients and somewhat similar soup.

This place is conveniently located at the 3rd story of Compassone. It can get crowded during dinner timings, so be sure to reach before 7pm and claim your seats!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNHNYMElBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Really yummy, especially with the current 30% of menu items during lunch. Recommend the fried rolled bean curd and the fishball with fish roe inside!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3RTUTdBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Good service but the prices has got up quite a bit. The hot soup based has not changed much through the years. Wished the had more local flavour like laksa etc..... We always go for the tomyam soup base. The personal pot style is expensive, to save money we always only order one small pot to share. Even with only one soup pot, the bill for two was over SGD80."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbDl0ZRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"I was not aware of this restaurant and it impressed me! Quite a varieties of soup base, I chose the sze chuan spicy and the other was pork soup.. lovely soup! Ingredients were fresh and at the sauces station, fried garlic was something I like! Refillable of certain beverages was via a constant walk around from the server.. empty plates are cleared promptly so that we have more table space! Pig skin and dace fishball was my fave!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvc0lyMGNnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"steamboat offering that is almost same as Beauty in a Pot. Price points is the same as BIAP and HDL. as we went during after peak lunch hour, it wasn't very crowded. restaurant was spacious and comfortable and ingredients are fresh. the current promotion is 30% discount for lunch until 2.30pm and 50% off from 2.31pm to 4pm. love the pork bone broth as well as cordycep flower herbal soup with mushroom."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOFlfOEVREAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,The 2.30-4.30pm discount is good. Ingredients are fresh and broth is also tasty. Love their mala broth.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbE43UEh3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"One of the first (I think) kind in Singapore with individual hot pot.

No need to share if you are particular about sharing.

Service is good. Food is fresh."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZ05XejN3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Food is good and price is reasonable, don't compared the soup with beauty pot. Individual liking.  2A2C, The staff told me I have to order additional pot for my kids but I saw other table come in later than me order 3 pots share by 6 Adults. I did not question the staff, I will order 2 pots next times instead of each per pot"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbHNXTEVnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Although the price is on the higher end, the food is great and service is good.
Definitely more worth the price if you go for the set meal"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNnN5MEV3EAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"One of the best hotpots I've had! The set meals are perfect! Great variety of dishes, so delicious! The broth was amazing too. Can see myself coming back to this place. Value for money ♥️ A gem of a find from Paradise Group"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvcU9ISjRBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Hotpot ingredients were very delicious and fresh! The soup were also very nice, very well worth the price that you pay for the food items itself! Even better, there is a lunch time promo where there is a 40% off for the food items that you order, this place also has Shopback Go support which is even better after all the discounts!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGNPbElnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,Price a bit too high! Service good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbk9xR3J3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Excellent service from Chunyan at Paradise Hotpot! She really went out of her way to rectify a mistake by the foodpanda rider.

We ordered the 2 pax set via foodpanda, and order came with only the ingredients without the soup base. When we called the restaurant, the staff was already waiting for my call, and explained that the rider had picked up the ingredients and left without collecting the soup base. She then got my address and cabbed down to my place herself to deliver the missing soup base. Very grateful for the excellent service and great attitude.

If there were 6 stars we would give 7 😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbF9ySFZnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Individual hotpot, selection not as much as ""beauty in the pot 美滋锅"", price about the same."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Z1lpTS13RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,3,"Expensive and feel not really nice. 2 of us eat dinner already $59.70
Nothing special."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcjVERDlBRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,2,"Food quality is ok but poor service. Was there at 5.30pm, approximately 10 tables of guests. My 2nd order of food took more than 30 mins to be served. And it was after a reminder from me to check on my order. One of the waitress who was attending to me halfway scooted off to the cashier to bill customers. When she was done, she forgot she was attending to me halfway. She then went to push a cart containing soups and beverages around. Until she saw me at my table, she then realised she was helping me halfway."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdUl6bmt3RRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Good service, awesome food! The ingredients are fresh and the soup bases are delicious. My family's favourite...the teochew style soup...a must try. Lunch time promotion - 30% off. Good deal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdDdEMHRRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,My favourite hotpot place. The lunchtime discount is awesome. Can’t wait to go back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNF9YWGhRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,5,Good food as usual! 3 pax around $100
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd2VuVkRREAE,Paradise Hotpot,5,"Totally immerse with the Tom yam soup! Especially when days that you are feeling down, hotpot at paradise will never go wrong!

The best time to pop by are during lunch and tea time, to make your money worth while! since they are having promotions! But not to fear, always call to make reservation for weekend dinners (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

Did a company event here years back and the service is really 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻. As a fan of hotpot, I will recommend here as compare to those Buffet style. Good food, good service, worth coming!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaWRqd0JnEAE,Paradise Hotpot,1,"Service was bad. Food was worse. Had pork broth and tomato corn soup base and they were not good. I thought the Paradise brand prides itself for being a top player in the market. Well, this truly was disappointing. Water had sand grains at the bottom of the glass, and when asked about it, the wait staff couldn't explain and hey, no apology was given. I couldn't even make out what they served for dessert. Not coming back to this outlet for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbHBmNzhRRRAB,Paradise Hotpot,4,"Good atmosphere, good quality of food. You pay for what you get. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaGIzZUFREAE,Paradise Hotpot,4,Same group as the beauty in the pot.... ingredients similar with similar pricing... but have discount ranging from 30 to 40%. Service level not as good as beauty in the pot. Very different soup base.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbnJiV1FBEAE,Paradise Hotpot,1,"Another table left early, when I pay for both table the cashier argued say the other table got 3 sauces and can even name the sauces. Already told them no sauce, once I cally mum ask them, it is no sauce, they suddenly say yaya no sauce... Trying to cheat money!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaTlYSGpBRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"We love the food here. Highly quality and full of flavour! We especially love the salad prawns, century egg appetiser, and black pepper beef.

We did have to remind them to serve the glass of water when almost all the dishes arrived though.

Everything else was pleasant and chill."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaU9LbUVBEAE,Canton Paradise,4,Quality of food still remains and my favourites still stay at the standard expected of the restaurant's reputation. Unfortunately service was a little tardy as the restaurant is busy and have to request for waitering staff multiple times to get condiments.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMUl2RWdnRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"Nice roast duck noodles with crispy skin.. Favorite accompanied with sour and spicy thick soup. Usually quite packed during lunch, so good to visit earlier."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MmVhSUZ3EAE,Canton Paradise,5,"The restaurant's roast meats are quite palatable.A light texture with a slight crunch.

delectable. mouth watering.

scrumptious meal"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMUppcHZRRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"Canton Paradise CompassOne has had a major redecoration and it looks great.
As usual, the food was great and the service staff was attentive and helpful.
Always a good place for a tasty meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcmFLaWpnRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"The roast duck is awesome. Their main dishes are pretty good too. The dim sum though, is just average for a higher tier restaurant such as this. I don’t mind returning for their roast meat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOHJHbGlnRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"First dine in after phrase 2 was over and glad that the experience was largely positive. Food was decent, especially like the HK style congee though the pig intestine was a tad too rubbery and hard to chew. Service was prompt and friendly which is always a plus. Will go back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNzR2YVl3EAE,Canton Paradise,5,"The place was full. We made a reservation for 1pm and was seated in around 1.10pm due to full seating.

Food was served up considerably fast after ordering. Taste wise the food was good and the price is justified. For the premium price, the taste was premium too.

We had the noodles and congee as mains and they were just fantastic. The congee was well cooked and the taste blended in perfectly. The noodles were springy and the meat (Irish fat duck) was so juicy. Combined with their delicious greens and signature sauce, it is something you won't taste in hawker establishments.

Dim sum wise we had the harkau and liu Sha bao. Both were well presented but only averagely tasting. Har kau skin was too thick, and lacking in taste, despite the full filling of prawns. Liu Sha bao was cute but also lacking in flow ability and also buns were not fluffy enough.

Overall, it was a very good lunch and we would definitely come back again due to the friendly service.

One thing that can be improved is the speed of serving drinks so that we can remove our masks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeWZIV0V3EAE,Canton Paradise,5,"My fav dim sum joint !
Love their egg tarts , siew Mai , har kao, chicken claws and more !!"

First of all, thanks to the chinese lady by the name of Yique for your excellent customer service. The Food came fast. ALL are very delicious and that includes the beverage that i have ordered ( Water Chest Nut + Ice Lemon Tea ) The Sweet And Sour Pork is NOT hard ....Surprisingly it was Tender and Juicy.... Oh and the French bean it was very very delicious....Loved it when mixed with the Minced Pork.... By the way i have lost count of how many times i have dine/pack away order @ this outlet  :-)

2020 Review This Canton Paradise @ Sengkang their Porridge is super delicious and their Roast Duck is SUPER Good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2ZTM3V3RRAB,Canton Paradise,1,Not worth the long wait and ended with food that is not living up to expectation. First and last time. Ding Tai Feng or Soup Restaurant is a better alternative.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLXRIaTJRRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"One of the paradise group restaurants that never fails to deliver good food and services.

It’s usually crowded during dinner time especially weekends so do expect estimate of 30 minutes waiting time.

Food came relatively quick after ordering.
Beef noodle - it’s surprisingly good on both the noodle and meat! Would even be better if the portion is slightly bigger.
Ting Zai congee - one of the signature dish and its tasty even without soy sauce.
XO carrot cake - soft and fragrant
Liu Sa Bao - nicely presented though it seems to downsize a little
Spicy vinegar dumplings - well filled on the ingredients

If you were to go during weekday 3 - 5pm, there is an ongoing tea time promotion with up to 40% discount. If not otherwise it may be slightly pricey."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMU9yaTB3RRAB,Canton Paradise,1,Never going to order from here again and i advise others not to as well unless you rly nothing better to do. Waited close to 1hr for delivery food and yet still preparing. Not the first time as well. Had to head down personally to see whats the situation and found out so many riders waiting for orders. Poor kitchen management. DTF or paradise dynasty better than this
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck9DcFpBEAE,Canton Paradise,1,"1. most of the staff were good, but one of them, Yi Qiu was mean and ignorant. we tried so hard to order the food and had requests like taking photo, but she ignored us when we asked 3 times.
2. one of the dish, the roast duck, was not roasted well enough. it was frozen meat and the texture was too hard. i wouldnt order it if i were you.
3. what kind of establishment is this? no tablecloth and the table is dirty. i pay for expensive service charge and the food is expensive, but i do not receive equal amount of service that i paid for. i mean seriously? if i walk into a high paying restaurant, paying 8 dollars for service, at least set up a new tablecloth to give me good hygiene!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwc19pQmN3EAE,Canton Paradise,5,"Consistent dim sum & Cantonese cuisine in the heartlands but portions have reduced over time, becoming more costly by the day!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJekl1RE1nEAE,Canton Paradise,4,"The food was well done, with an authentic Cantonese flair. Some dishes to look out for would be their roast meat platter and spiced dumplings.

Service was adequate, but the place is usually swamped in the evenings, with long wait times and poorer service. At times it felt like the place was understaffed. The service staff made do with the manpower they had however, and did their best to make the dining experience enjoyable.

Would definitely recommend having a meal here if authentic Cantonese cuisine is what you are looking for."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncmVfaXVRRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"It's a nice place to dine in with the family. There's a great variety of chinese/cantonese-style food to please everyone in my family, from my parents-in-law to my young children. And I love that they now cater to vegetarians too by including a number of great vegetarian dishes in their menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcVkzWjZRRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"Dined a couple of times, on weekdays evenings and weekends mealtimes it can be quite crowded but weekends 3-5pm it’s rather empty.

Food 🍽
Recommended dishes are:
- roast pork belly/ bbq pork
- XO carrot cake
- signature bbq pork bun with boluo crust
- congee - so smooth and delicious
- HK milk tea - served in an iced tumbler, very creamy and full of flavour
- Cheong fun (rice rolls)
- glutinous chicken rice wrapped in pandan leaf - it’s a small portion so just nice for one to eat

Ambience and accessibility 🕯♿️
Have seen plenty of elderly in wheelchair coming in and restaurant is spacious thus definitely accessible. They will even help to shift the chairs to make way for wheelchair to slot into the table instead. Have baby chairs and also booth seats.

Service is generally pretty attentive and welcoming. Do note the nuts at the start are chargeable so feel free to reject if you like. Wet tissues are also chargeable.

If you have a Citibank card, pay with it and get $10 return voucher with $50 min spend. Weekdays 3-5pm diners can also enjoy 40% off dim sum"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcl8tcnVBRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"One of the better Tim Sum place in SengKang
Tim Sum quality is consistently good.
Avoid lunch and dinner times during weekends due to overcrowding.
Drink portions are small
Service has room for improvement"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcnFuZFdnEAE,Canton Paradise,4,"20171119 - seems a little overwhelming on dining times, better to plan time accordingly. When compared to taste paradise (ion orchard), the food served here is less impressive. rice skin has a tangy taste to it, not fully firm. pig organs in the porridge should be sliced thinner, else they are not cooked evenly. XO stir fry rice cake were wet and bland - could not finish. on a broad basis, it is above average but as a paradise group and price (raised) component, it does not meet the mark. service is good and attentive. 4-star at best."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbnEtaHBRRRAB,Canton Paradise,1,"After confirming additional food order, the food did not come despite 3 attempts to remind the service personnel. When it comes to payment, it was promptly included though.

Updated review. Service has improved although they still miss out on 1 item on our order."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0tDUG53RRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"Great food as usual. From the century egg to wanton mee to crispy char siew bun and the fantabulous egg tarts, we couldn't get enough of it. Just a tad costly though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOGY3ekRREAE,Canton Paradise,5,"Good food & good service.
Salted egg prawn: 5/5. SGD21.5 without GST. Only 6pcs. However, the prawn are big and fresh!
Sweet and sour pork: 5/5. Best sweet and sour pork in Singapore.
Tofu salt pepper: 2/5. So so..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOElPUTZnRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"Nice Cantonese cuisine and also dim sum dishes available. Good soups plus 3 types meat available - steam chicken, roast pork, Barbeque pork!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvN1pEbldnEAE,Canton Paradise,5,The food and service was really good! Highly recommend to give this restaurant a try! It is part of the part of the paradise group chain of restaurants in Singapore. Cost wise it is also very affordable and won’t break the bank! Would visit again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeHR2SHZnRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"I think this place deserves more credit. Everything that I ordered today was perfect. Service was a little sub-standard, but the food... I would come here just for the food. The 水餃 was crunchy, light, the XO Carrot Cake flavorful, and the E-fu noodles just the right amount of oil."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4dlo3cFpREAE,Canton Paradise,4,"Roast duck, egg tart & crispy bbq pork bun are recommended. However, the molten salted egg yolk piggy bun was a big disappointment. It’s more like a paste than “molten”. Cute but not worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJbzVTQTBnRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"WoW. Is it possible that every dish you order is worth your 4 or 5 star rating without complains?

That is what happened to my family and I last week. Food ordered were roast duck (yummy), braised beef (with tendon in clay-pot), spinach (wet with egg), chee chung fun (crispy mushroom), pear and ribs soup (double boiled), 3 treasures porridge(smooth).

Staff were attentive and courteous even though placed was PACKED. The queue outside was insane. Quality food and family time spent =)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrM3AtSXZBRRAB,Canton Paradise,3,"Took the signature porridge, fried bean curd wrap and the egg tarts. Egg tarts were the only dish worth commending. The rest were too salty and not half as good as those at the Canton Paradise at JEM, Jurong."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNUlEaV9BRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,BBQ platter & XO carrot cake standard seems to drop. Overall satisfactory.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZX0tPWDVBRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,"Finished all our food, totally wiped clean. Great quality food, pleasant and warm service staff, consistently good, family friendly, a bit pricey to the wallet, but it’s really decent quality Cantonese dim-sum. Generous Portion and nice for a family dinner together.

Ordered their Yang-Zhou fried rice - 5/5, can be shared with 3 person,
we had steamed rice roll with fried bean curd - 4/5, extremely tasty and need to be shared or it becomes ‘jelat’.
Steamed pork-bun, nice char siew filling....
Prawn steamed dumpling aka Xiao long bao - decent, but can make their skin thinner...
Steamed pork meat dumpling in chili oil... nice! It’s not too spicy and ‘numb-ing’!

All in all, I love the experience and I will certainly come back for more!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0eGNueTZBRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,Price is reasonable and the food is also not bad. There is also promotion for duck meats per plate at only $8.80. (U.P $18).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcjlXblZBEAE,Canton Paradise,1,"Very dishonest practice and misrepresentation. The waitress gave us two plates of fish skin and said please try as appetizer, if you like it,you can buy two packets at 13.80. we asked if it's chargeable and she repeated the same to ask us to try.

One of my folks started eating the first plate and another waitress came and said it's chargeable.. we were shock and she said it's okay, she will bring one back and only charge one plate. It's covid season, they left food down when our masks were down and they took it back to serve another table ..

At the cashier I asked if they knew they were dishonest and many had complained, the cashier just smiled and kept quiet. She did not refund when I requested and just said,"" I will feedback"".

Simply dishonest Canton Paradise staffs..
Patrons, please beware."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ19DRjJ3RRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"The food good staff good but the whole restaurant got mirrors everywhere, no matter where you turn can see people"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeGVIcnhBRRAB,Canton Paradise,2,"Food quality and service standard has dropped. Price has gone up. Tea charged by no. of persons, although the serving size is the same - one pot regardless of head count (add water only)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNHN1bklBEAE,Canton Paradise,5,"Wonderful service, nice dim sum and definitely great service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bk1TdVRnEAE,Canton Paradise,1,"I called the hotline to try to get a booking but my call was turned down every time. Called multiple times over different timings throughout the day but same thing all the time. ""Open for bookings"" they say."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbU51NzFBRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"Dine in the restaurant a little later after typical lunch time to avoid the crowd.

The admission was quick and friendly, the waitress came promptly to take our order and the meal was served up pretty quickly.

The food quality is good and the portion is appropriate for the price. However, the lack of the 5th star was attributed by the lack of attention from the staff, we have to wave our hands fanatically and called out loudly before I can get my chili sauce.

But the dining experience was saved by a senior (age, not ranking) staff who took over the service from the other one who was supposed to be waiting at our table. She was friendly and chatty but not overwhelming for us to enjoy our meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNja2VLWGZBEAE,Canton Paradise,5,Food is yummy. Very good service. Even take temp and Sanitize all customers hands before going in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld09iMmhnRRAB,Canton Paradise,4,"Now they had a promotion if order value above $30, free kids menu set"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeUplUnRBRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,Currently there promotion ongoing for member. Expect to be crown during weekend dinner
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMW9qYW5nRRAB,Canton Paradise,1,"I order pick up from food panda, and the item late for 35-40 mins from the agreed time. Poor management!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEtUbjFBRRAB,Canton Paradise,5,Happy hours discount is fabulous. Comfort food to the max
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaU9YNmlnRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Nice little 煮炒, air-conditioned, neat and clean. We had deep fried squid, tofu and broccoli. The prices may be steeped compared to coffee-shop prices but I think it is worthwhile as it is after all air-conditioned. I like it that the food isn't salty or taste like msg. The tofu was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. As I don't eat pork, I simply scrapped the pork toppings from the tofu. I appreciate that the waitress is service-oriented. She was attentive and the food were served very promptly. Oh yes, their barley was homemade without the canned drink type of taste. We'll definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyak1Mb21RRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Worth visiting if you are looking for Chinese food in Jalan Kayu area. Visited on Friday evening. Quite packed around 7pm and seems to be short of experienced server. We were seated inside and situation was sort of chaotic as the service staffs seems very disoriented but they are doing their best to serve.

Food came out of kitchen at a fast speed. Taste wise is good. Of all the dishes ordered (sorry not all had pictures), we only find curry fish head gravy a bit watery and Mongolia pork ribs not to our expectation. The rest of dishes were good. Especially the homemade tofu and hand shredded cabbage are very nice.

They had local food and also SiChuan dishes. Saw a lot of others ordering grill fish. Will want to try in next visit! And hoped that their service staffs are better trained up by then."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdTZMQWt3RRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Was looking for a TingKat meal for the family during the CV19 period and was recommended this place. Was informed that they had to convert to TongKat business due to the CV19 and I’m glad that they did. Coz it allowed my family and I to have a taste of their home cook style food. Also... might I add that there’s a standard to their cooking. Unlike mass cooked food caterers, you can see the effort and pride put into preparing the food.

Received the first delivery today and am really impressed. Rice was well cooked. Not too hard nor soft. Braised fish was fresh and not too spicy or salty. Mushrooms are not the el cheapo type of mushrooms. Soup was yummy and flavorful too.

Over all... they are not the cheapest in the market but comparing the food quality and that the food is delivered hot... it’s definitely worth every cent. Portions are generous too. My family are quite heavy eaters and are all quite stuffed after lunch.

Was so impressed that am going to change the 10 days trial to prob the 20 days menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLTQzLVV3EAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Mala hotpot with beef. Soup mild spiciness, beef added flavour to the soup. Homemade tofu thumb up, with a little minced pork and spring onion soya sauce blends well. La Zi Ji, bits of chicken skin, was crispy. Also their Mongolian salted egg pork another must try(not in pic)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHF6VGNBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,The fish head curry is good. But the price point is higher than normal Zi char. Very surprised that the food taste very good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a09pNDRBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,We ordered delivery since heightened alert in May. Made several rounds of changes to reservations due to restrictions. Lady was super patient in handling changes including menu change. I was quite paiseh. She eventually delivered it to me personally to Punggol in Sept. On time. Food was good. The $99 crab promo for 2 was worth it. Surprisingly not small for the price. Lala n tofu were good too. Hopefully to visit the actual store soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1di1pamRBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Tasty Mongolian pork rib ($15.90) & FuRong egg ($11.90) for dinner.

Portion was reasonable but unfortunately prices went up quite a lot by between 22% to 49%.

Only one waitress managing and occasionally a kitchen staff help to serve out food , so be prepared to wait.

I must admit that this waitress is superb at handling the dinner crowd; taking orders, collect payment, serving food, clearing & cleaning tables - where to find"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaC1PWUJ3EAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Food and ambiance was great!
Crayfish was fresh"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbW9uRktREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Tried the mala fish and taste good. Kids like the tofu too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbVB1WEp3EAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Food: 4* but slightly sweet for mee goreng,  others just nice.
Service: 4*
Chrysanthemums and rose tea: 4*
Location: shop just in front of the bus stop at Jalan Kayu.
Will be back again to try other foods"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaWNDbEt3EAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"The price of food is quite reasonable. The taste was OK for some of the food. The shop also offers quite a number of ""China"" style food (which we happen to not order).

The services is also good as they will help to top up hot water for drinks as well as help to pour the tea.

Definitely will comeback"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbUlyal93RRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,"Love their food. Their hotpot is good and their chi zhar is good. They're one of our favourite stalls at Jalan Kayu, but unfortunately the restaurant is severely understaffed. There's only one poor guy as waiter during peak hours, and you can see him struggling to juggle so many tables.

If you're the owner of the place who happe  to read this, please for the love of good food hire more help for your restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTejQ2MFJBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,My 2nd visit n this time I brought my family along. Enjoyed all the dishes while seated in the airconditioned area. The service from the staff is once again  great n staff is courteous n patience. Highly recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aE5qalhBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"We ordered FuRong Omelette, MaPo ToFu, baby kailan, hot & spicy boneless chicken. The food was delectable! The service was outstanding. Short-staffed but still attentive. They checked if we preferred chopsticks or fork/spoon. They made sure we knew size portion, etc. They communicated well. Everything arrived quickly. Beer was served ice-cold as well. Premises was spotless and tables very clean. No GST and no service charge, so definitely deserve a tip!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbllmVE5REAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Very good food... Specially the seafood and curry fish head.
Recommend to call and book in advanced.
Am super impressed with their service during the 2 pax limit time.
We had 2 + 1 pax that time. Lady host offered to assist to split portions equally into 2. She frequently check on us if need additional assistance.
Keep up the great service and food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGV2UGlBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Good tze char food in the Jalan Kayu area, the milk tea is great and I recommend ordering it. Service is fast and prompt. My partner and I love the Szechuan-inspired food, particularly the kao yu. Tried the salted veg one and the signature one before and it was very delicious.

The only bad thing is that there are no options to put extra ingredients into the broth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbl83WUtREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,Delicious comforting grilled fish. The non-spicy option was delightfully tasty. Need to wait abit as the restaurant can be packed at peak periods.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMjVPdGJBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,2,"Update: standard has dropped, waiting is now endless, and it’s really hard to get food decently here.

-old outdated-
Umpteenth visit to this aircon clean zhichar place with great food and reasonable prices. Ate the seafood horfun again and again.. with lovely wokhei for only $6.50. highly recommended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNza3U2YXBnRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Finally got to try this place along jalan kayu, which happened to be open despite being CNY D3! We walked past a couple of times and it’s always filled with long queues. Food is pretty tasty, decent pricing although the portions tend to be slightly on the small side! Must haves: salted egg chicken, ngoh hiang, furong egg (has lots of ingredients inside and very soft!)! Toilet is super clean, like that at orchard road!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpb29xRU5nEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Visited this restaurant a couple times. The restaurant is located alongside several eateries on Jalan Kayu. On both visits, the restaurant was not very crowded and we got a table immediately.
Service is good from arriving at restaurant, ordering food and waiting time.
On this visit, I ordered the curry fishhead. The taste is perfectly balanced and really delicious.
The shop is also kept very clean and bright.
Overall experience is very good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aFlMYVlREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Satisfied with their service here. Food was ok but will be better if dishes like yangzhou fried rice and furong egg can be less oily and lacking of wok hey smell. Will revisit again for their Sichuan dishes and western food, hope it will not disappoint us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMVltQWlBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,food is nice. staff is friendly. outside seats too many mosquitoes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcy1mVk1REAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,Great flavour food. Have the sichuan style. Price is affordable. Can be short handed during peak hours during to only 2 staff on floor. Parking lots available at open carpark around 8mins away. Hidden gem.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNS1QNTVRRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Tasty and decent pricing.
Sweet and sour pork rice was too sweet, but the Mee goreng was good!
Accepts cash, nets and Amex."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM3VqdTZBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"We happened to step in to this place by luck due to our prior bad experience with another Bistro. We were super surprised with the food choices, quality and taste of the food. The gold plating was the service offered by Wei Meng, we loved it.. Thanks for making our Sunday evening blissful.. Highly Recommend this Heroic place.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNGJxSjJ3RRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,3,Taste good. 3 dashes (photos) + 2 drinks and 2 rice at about $40. Will try again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybDZpMndBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Japanese oysters not on the menu, quite fresh and tasty! Fried rice portion a bit small but taste wise is good 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDlLcmNnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Reasonably priced food. However, fried dim sum is at best average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbGZxZ1RnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Portion was alright, good place for family dinner, lunch hours is not packed, but for dinner do call ahead to make booking"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbDVTYVFBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,2,"This is apparently their clay pot noodles. First time I’ve seen a clay pot noodles with soup. I overheard the service staff asking the kitchen staff why was there soup, but somehow it still was served to me. The service staff also insisted that the clay pot noodles had soup in it. Benefit of the doubt I suppose. The “claypot noodles” was passable. An egg was also forgotten from my order.

In the half an hour in this establishment, there was also a blackout."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPc2FHcTRBRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,The male waiter is pretty rude and the service is extremely slow. Food is so so and be ready to wait and be seen as transparent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhc3NxdThnRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,We had the hot pot today and it was nice!  Husband got the chilli dip and I had the sesame dip.  Mix them both and it was really yummy!  Will be great if we can have different drink choices instead of the default lime juice :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcHFUdWJBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Hotpot is great!! Must order beef.... absolutely 💯% recommended ❤️
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aGRyZWFnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,"Very unpleasant dining experience at Lao Hero kitchen on 12 Mar around 6:30pm. , I booked a 6-8 seated round table at the back of the restaurant 2 days prior, with another 5-6 seated square table at the corner as backup in case of the former was occupied on that day. The manager of the restaurant told me she might not be able to secure the round table for me if a group with 6 or more people came before me on that day. But she promised that the 6 seated table at the back corner of the restaurant would definitely be reserved for me. I agreed and a confirmation message was sent to my phone afterwards. However, on the actual day, the round table was taken while the 6 seated table at the corner was deliberately split into tables for 2 and 4. Confused, I approached the staff and she told us to sit at the table near the door. After explaining to her about the reservation 2 days prior, she helped merge the tables together and let us sit there. However, the manager saw this later on and approached the staff, reprimanded her for letting us occupy that table, and demanded us to shift, we told her that we had booked that table and she said she was aware but still demanded us shift to the table near the entry door. My friend was shocked what was happening and demand a explanation and apology. Although we were finally allowed to occupied the table we booked, but no apologies were given at all and the manager was extremely impatient the whole time. I was really appalled and disappointed by their rude service and will definitely won’t recommend this restaurant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaHJUN29BRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Ordered cereal prawn, broccoli scallop & 2 chili crabs with a seafood soup. Didn't manage to criticize any of the dishes. All dishes of the taste found spot on and waitress was single handling the ground in well manner. Lastly, the rice was quality. Expandable future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTaUtyVEh3EAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,3,"food is good but only 3 stars because there is a young waitress who served my table that was very unprofessional and rude. She served and push a hot bowl to my table that 烫到 my hand but she just walked away 😓 when serving it, she didn’t even say excuse me to inform us she was placing the hot bowl down.   (also she also wears a really short denim shorts while working????)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkw2SFhBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Great food & service. They have promotion for crabs currently. Crabs are fresh and in decent size. Value for money👍😋. And whole rows of interesting food shops outside the restaurant including durian cake was good.  Will go again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpa3R1Z1NREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,"Been there afew times, both dine in & takeout.  The crab promo is a good deal. Their crabs are fresh & of good quality, especially loving their black pepper crab. Their hor fun is good too. Their price is reasonable and no service charge if you dine in. Free milk tea if you order for takeaway."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpX0l1U0NnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,"I made a reservation via Chope, was happy there was a follow up automated call to confirm the booking & I had specifically state i need the coolest seat available yet when we turn up they told us 'reservation' seat are all alfresco seats & we have to wait till the diners indoor are done. What was not acceptable was no table was set up ready for us at their alfresco area despite telling us 'reservation' is outdoor. If you cannot afford to take reservation, DON'T. I don't see any customer service provided. Totally disappointed & left since the they prefer to entertain walk ins."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdFl5dVlBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Cosy place . Good food . Will come back again . Nice experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMmF5U2ZnEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,4,Nice food yet not too expensive and quite affordable depending on people's views. Restaurant has nice interior and seemingly unique exterior. Service is good with friendly waitress who seems to like to talk to customers.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnJLdGJREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Nice Chinese food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvb3ZEeFhBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,Visited multiple times since they opened. Friendly staff always.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcS1ueFRREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Nice and cosy place to dine with good air conditioning. Staff was polite and responsible but do note that, I was dining during off peak hours. The restaurant operates on staggered hours so please call to confirm and reservation maybe required for evening peak hour dining. Food pricing is definitely economical and affordable dining in such environment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4cllXVjF3RRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,My family & I liked this place food and overall Lao Hero kitchen food are good not too salty but tasty n environment is also nice . Now they have promotion for 2 crabs $60 & can cook 2 types of sauces & foc 6 buns. Worth to eat😋😋😋😋.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrODhiVGFBEAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,"Terrible experience and customer service!
3 of us went and restaurant was kinda full, there was an empty small round-shaped table available but the waitress did not invite us in, we assumed it was being reserved. Waited at the door for around 15-20 minutes, another group of 6 queued behind us and obviously did not made a reservation, but was being invited in directly. When we asked the waitress, she replied because they can use the round-shaped table, and wanted us to wait for another smaller square-shaped table, with the customers still eating half way and who looked like gonna take at least 15-20 minutes to finish eating. We turned around and left, totally disappointed with this kind of service, and the waitress looked like she couldn't be bothered more.
Great job in prioritizing profit maximization rather than customer's experience! Will not recommend anyone to patron this restaurant!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0b01QZjNRRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,3,"Terrible service.
First, long waiting time for our group of 6 despite the restaurant being only half full.
Secondly, the PRC waitress had to ask us what we ordered when serving out our food when it eventually came. After that, she even got another table's order for ice water wrong and delivered it to our table!

Only saving grace is its food which is decent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MXNqRDl3RRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,1,Ordered food for pick up. Came at the timing they told us to come and they didn’t have it yet. Waited for another 15 minutes but the food wasn’t ready. Had to ask them again before they realise they already packed the food but didn’t search it properly the first time. The food also became cold since it was left waiting for so long. No apologies offered as well. Really bad customer service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNejVieGtRRRAB,Lao Hero Kitchen,2,"A very neat & clean chic air con Chinese restaurant. To be fair, for $6/- a small black hot clay pot of Lao Hero Laksa is graded satisfactory. The sliced fish cakes were not fresh and only 2 medium size prawns. Much improvement needed on the laksa."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdm9meGJREAE,Lao Hero Kitchen,5,"Cosy place with good food and great service. A wide variety of dishes are available and on weekdays, there are lunch sets. The food portion is generous and balance of taste is just right. Prawn paste chicken is a must try. Will definitely return to try more on the menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dk1UYTdnRRAB,One Chuan,5,"Was recommended to come here and the place didn't disappoint! Really surprised at the food quality and taste despite being located in an obscure location of a residential neighbourhood. The residents in the area really lucked out!

Food and good and tasty, also generally not too spicy. Service was good but the food took a little longer than expected to come out. From the looks of things, the kitchen is pretty small so can't be helped. Totally forgot to take a pic of their winner dish cause it was so good. Some special pork which you stuff into a fried mantou. Sorry this doesn't help much.

Definitely will be back to eat again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc0tpMjVBRRAB,One Chuan,4,"What a cute find in Buangkok! The menu looks super tasty and the dishes served up didn’t disappoint. Highlights were the grilled spicy sliced fish, mapo tofu, fried eggplant and that sweet and sour pork (in a nostalgic batter from our childhood) made for a very moreish dinner. Prices are great, peppercorns are numbing and we will be back soon to eat the rest of the menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cHRYdmp3RRAB,One Chuan,3,"Environment was clean.
Some hits and misses here for the dishes.

Fried rice with slightly bland. There was some canned luncheon meat, carrots, egg and sliced pork.

The beef hot pot stock was quite salty. The beef was sliced beef. Our guess is they are using frozen beef. When it came, a chunk of them were stuck together and raw when we separated them.
We ate a total of 1 slice. There was also canned luncheon meat.

Cabbage was crunchy and tasty with slight umami. Quite good.

The fried bun with pork was very nice. Slight porky taste. But still bearable if you are not sensitive to it.

So overall I would have to say this isn’t value for money if you are going for quality of ingredients.
Would be a nice restaurant to pop in if you stay around the area. I’m quite sure they have other dishes that are tasty. However, this was all I could eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX1piS1BnEAE,One Chuan,5,"Really liked this place!! Good vibes and good food, had no complaints on the customer service too! Maybe jus a tad lil pricey but i would say for the taste, i would definitely come back for more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHA3SmJnEAE,One Chuan,5,"Extremely tasty Sichuan dishes 🙌 Service was A+ too, the kitchen missed our order out, and compensated by giving us a free dish! Food is very affordable for the quality, WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK AGAIN :) 好吃!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtamZXYktnEAE,One Chuan,5,"Very comfortable environment.  unique and special.  Like a garden different with other Chinese restaurant.
Food are authentic.  Tasty. Potion enough for us.  Worth to try"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOU5QRV9nRRAB,One Chuan,5,"Highly recommended, and probably one of the better Sichuan cuisines in Singapore. Very authentic and the 水煮牛肉 is really tasty. I will definitely go again. Worth the extra mile! 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd1BLQUp3EAE,One Chuan,5,"Love their zichar dishes, especially the 烤鱼片片香 & 金汤肥牛. Great food at reasonable price. Portions are of good size. Will definitely return again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdi1pam9RRRAB,One Chuan,3,Food was alright but the place is dirty. We were seated behind near the kitchen and floor is wet. The water is coming out from the kitchen. Staffs are not attentive to customers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGV6R2tRRRAB,One Chuan,4,Surprisingly good. Loved the eggplant and salted mushroom.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc01ySkR3EAE,One Chuan,3,"The food is a little bit pricy but acceptable. Don't recommend order 老北京羊蝎子 as the portion is quite small.
As for the taste, it is good.
The most upset thing happened was the table next to us was realy loud. other customers also asked them to keep voice low but no use. So it was horrible experience in terms of the environment. However I'm sure this is an occasional case."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybE5XOFlBEAE,One Chuan,2,Be there twice. Food is just ok. Not aware can use their promotion tab via online menu. Order same dish but like 10 dollar more cash. Unable to refund back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOWV1aGJnEAE,One Chuan,3,Food so so. Price is reasonable.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHZiVDZRRRAB,One Chuan,5,"Good vibe restaurant. Clean & comfy, food was served fast on a not so busy weekday afternoon
Mapo Tofu = Good taste, authentic not too oily compare with others
Grilled sliceFish = Fresh fish, fresh ingredient
Rice = Fragrant rice, not the usual dry/cheap type"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOFlUOEt3EAE,One Chuan,4,"Just returned from the family's first visit to he cafr after we shifted to this area, so we decided to give it a go! Environment was really pleasant, the interior feels like that of a vegetarian dining cafe. The customer's srervice was really commentary- you get alert and friendly staffs. Food is relatively good and we were quite surprised by the portions , certainly sufficient for larger groups. The fried rice on the other hand needs to be improved though 🤪 overall, nice vibes!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta1lhTzNBRRAB,One Chuan,1,"The service at the restaurant is bad and slow. My takeaway order of ONE dish took almost an hour. Needless to say, I saw many helpless diners waiting in vain for their food today in the restaurant. In particular, the cashier's service is very bad and rude. I recall that she used to be a staff at the previous Chicken-Up restaurant. I used the CDC voucher as I saw that they accept it. However, the cashier insisted that I had to 'round up' the charges rather than be able to use a combination of CDC/cash to make the exact change. A case of cheating the customer?"

Price - a bit expensive for the portion and location.

I left 30 mins after finishing my cold dishes - as the hot dishes are still in the kitchen - not a place to be if you are just here when hungry."

When they have fewer customers. They will allow you to sit in as long as you want.

The food is so authentic and yummy. And can choose your spicy level.

Lao ban niang so nice also, will always do her best to attend to our special requests.

Didn't expect much before coming. I never thought that a Sichuan restaurant could be so delicate and beautiful. The lady boss is really awesome👍🏻

And the moment I sit down, I feel so comfortable, so casual, I can really sit there and work all afternoon.

And the point is that the food is delicious, but only if you can eat spicy food🤪 But there are also several special dishes that children can eat.

而且坐下来的那一刻就觉得好舒服，好休闲，真的可以坐在那里整个下午工作。

而且重点是东西好好吃，只是前提是你要能吃辣🤪 不过也是有好几样特色菜是小朋友可以吃的哦。"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM0l1eUhREAE,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Boon Tong Kee is your chicken rice stall at your local coffee shop, but ✨ fancy ✨. Food is good though, paid about $16 for a chicken rice set meal with peanuts, broccoli and also a drink to go along with it and gotta say, yummy. Only thing is that $16 is somewhat too much for chicken rice considering there’s coffee shops selling stuff similar to this for $5, but the air conditioning, clean tables and friendly staff makes up for it slightly. Overall, quite good for a chicken rice enthusiast like me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycjR6Ymd3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Basically good ol’ chicken rice with upscale zichar vibes!

Some dishes such as their classic steamed chicken and 炒粒粒were delicious, whereas some really bordered on being too salty (the braised tofu with seafood had wayyyyy too much sodium than needed)

Prices are also much higher than your regular kopitiam chicken rice, but that’s reasonable for the location and the fact that it’s a standalone restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnFhNVZ3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,4,"All dishes are yummy tonight!

Food tastes are much better than delivery. This branch location is convenient. Just a straight walk after exit MRT station."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNUx1YVFREAE,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Place is clean & service  consistence. Food portion just right & testy of course. But they use dettol as cleaning solution for table, leaving a strong disinfecting smell quite unpleasant. They can use odourless disinfecting solution. Just a suggestion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM1k2NG1nRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Food is always served quickly and its delicious. Rice is tasty, chicken is tender, and chilli is not too spicy but still adds alot of flavour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbWZPb0tBEAE,Boon Tong Kee,2,"Had dinner here. Chicken and vegetables were ok, but sweet and sour pork was terrible! No pieces of meat at all, just pork fats and flour crumbs, see photo! Tiny pieces, not a single proper piece of meat. We gave feedback, was told their boss said that ""their sweet and sour pork is like that one, is all fats one, no meat, that's the way they cook.""

Ridiculous! Shame on them. Never order their sweet and sour pork, such a disappointment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNE1MT0tnEAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"It's a chicken rice place, so we ordered chicken rice. The steamed chicken was great and the sauce was really good. The prawn roll and crispy tofu were tasty too. Service was very good, prompt and friendly. This place is walk-in only and didn't take reservations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNl9tdmhRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,This Boon Tong Kee outlet is probably the nicest one I’ve been too so far! Very upmarket feel with very reasonable pricing. The service was also great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3NhaHJ3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,"General service is good. 5 stars because of this lady who really made our dining experience  positive. She will check on us to see if chilli is enough, or needed to pack when she saw some leftover. She also make sure that our additional takeaway order is only  when we almost done with our dine in. So that we won't have to wait too long and still warm.

However the food quality has dropped. The chicken meat is hard, still tasty and the skin has some obvious ""feather"". Rice is still good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc0tqSG13RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Chicken was quite nice and boneless, portion order was for 2 and it's delicious. Only problem is that the soup wasn't provided. Highly reccomend"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMnJySUV3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Was ordering a set B for lunch 2 days ago on Monday. The set comes with steam chicken, rice, side dish mushroom and lotus root soup. Potion is just nice and tasty as usual. But what stands out from my dining experience was the service. I broke the strap of my mask accidentally while trying to put it on at the end of my meal and try to re-tie it. During payment, without my mentioning about my mask, the cashier handed a new and better one to replace mine. This make my day.

Good service from Ah Liang, keep it up."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNTl2MlRREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"This place never disappoints. Chicken is fresh, rice is fragrant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlanNmN0NREAE,Boon Tong Kee,2,"Ordered the Set D chicken rice with pepper pig intestine soup.  Not impressive. Soup tasted like pepper water, ginger paste was watery.   Staff chatting non stop next to my table, couldn't have a relaxing lunch after a busy morning. Environment is very clean and cozy.Overall experience, 2/5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdGIzeVZnEAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Perfect place for a decent chicken rice. Ambience is great, service staff is polite. Price is at the high side, but still worth it. The vegetable is lightly salted and chicken rice is very fragrance. Their signature chicken is still the best as compared to the roast chicken. Chilli and ginger paste taste fresh and great too. Will come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMklHZmRREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,We had dinner there and the food was excellent. The service was quick. I have yet to go to a restaurant where all the food is served within 15mins. Only spoiler was it was a family night and a few screaming kids spoil it a bit for us.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNE5mWENREAE,Boon Tong Kee,3,"Haven't had it for sometime now but the chicken rice, chicken, the fragrant soya sauce and chili plus the crispy tofu. Would like to add that the only missing item would be to have some nice hot soup served with the meal to make it even better"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMExDX2dRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,"BTK has a name for itself, for good reasons. Fragrant rice and tender chicken, perfectly cooked and chilled which left it juicy and gelatinous. Fried tofu was also a surprisingly good dish - soft and silky inside, with a crispy and lightly salted skin. Avoid their coffee ribs, until they do something about it - we all had one bite and left the dish alone for good reason, it was both too sweet and too bitter, the coffee and sugar flavours did not merge successfully and left an awkward aftertaste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweTg2Ni1RRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,Had dinner at the new compass one stall. The chicken is good. You must try the chicken when you are there. Ordered other dishes and found them too be good as well. I will surely return for more of the chicken rice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpN0k3Z1dREAE,Boon Tong Kee,4,The chicken dish used to be much better and rice is a little too starchy. The classic deep fried soft tofu still as good as ever. Still good overall.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWNyS0V3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,1,Pathetic chicken rice set.. not sure how much meat in there but pure pathetic. Guess the better meat are reserved for dining in customer.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMXN5VEtREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"So yummy... Toufu is very crispy , must try it ... all food was delicious also ... love the all..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDlUVjBRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,👍 😋 Chicken tasty 🐔 rice and fried bean curd with hard crust but soft 🔥 inside.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd19XSzR3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,Nice fragrant chicken rice. Tender chicken pieces. The bundled meals are value for money. Chili adds a punch
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwZ18yYVJnEAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Newly opened branch at Compassone about 2 weeks ago. Conveniently located a short walk from Sengkang MRT after walking straight down with Polar Puffs and Cakes on right, BTK is on the left. Restaurant has crowd waiting for takeaway and to dine in. Am glad it didn’t take too long for me to queue for takeaway. It only took 15mins for me and the customer before me to receive our takeaways. Maybe because it’s a little chaotic in the kitchen, some customers with queue numbers earlier than me were skipped.

The takeaways were very nicely packed with all sauces and sturdy cutlery set given. The Chicken rice tastes similar to BTK at Boon Keng. Takeaways are also available on Deliveroo."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOV9hQVhREAE,Boon Tong Kee,3,"Food is great, service used to also be good when they first opened, today was my visit after 6 months and I was disappointed.

Spoon provided was dirty, I asked for an exchange, the middle aged staff with dyed dark brown pony tail and hair bun attended to our table, no apologies provided. She took the list of order, which clearly stated 1 chicken rice, 1 plain rice, but served us 2 chicken rice instead. I highlighted, she did not even apologize and just exchanged with white rice.

We were preparing to leave and was about to wear our masks, halfway through she asked to clean the table. We kindly requested for her to wait till we stand up, she looked at her colleagues, repeated what we said while rolling her eyes. The reason we requested that was because we had past experiences where food and drinks were spilled onto our clothes during clearing, was it too much to ask since wearing mask was just 10-20 seconds?

Overall food was great, but fairly bad experience with this particular staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXanY2WEJREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,Never will complain about the chicken. The meat is tender. Generally good service and good food. Only need to take note of side dish price before you order. Some side dish could be over price!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbmFqcV9BRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,1,"The food is generally decent but the staff attitude is hopeless.

I ordered a takeaway and was given a number buzzer. A staff came by and left my takeaway next to all the food orders on the table next to me. Not a single word that it was mine. The buzzer did not go off.

It was only 5 min later when I realised it was my order and asked the staff why noone told me it is mine.

This is the second time I have to deal with poor attitude from this branch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjbE1PMGR3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Thanks to Covid-19. We’re only able to do takeaway. But since every restaurant is only able to do takeaway. They are competing among themselves with various deals & promos. Boon Tong Kee is no exception. They have some of the more value deals in the market. At $8 plus GST. You get boiled chicken, veggies, a meat ball & a side (fish slices, Thai tofu, prawn roll, meat ball, salad you tiao or pork belly mui cai). Not only this they got various other deals available. Check out the website. Thou their online service is really not up to standard yet. Some inconvenient as it’s not that 100% process."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMm9feFd3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Overall quite good.  Just chicken a bit tasteless (although v tender) if eat without the chilli sauce.
V crowded ."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHNDbnlRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,Very nice and delicious chicken rice. Fully recommended to give a try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdnU2cDV3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,4,"Nice ambience, good service, and fragrant chicken rice. Only missing part is there is no soup served together"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXB1ZUV3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,3,The combo set was a disappointment. There was any chicken meat at all for the chicken. Lots of skin and fats.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHek43TEF3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Excellent service provided by Alice from Compassone. She was extremely friendly and helpful. I saw her paying attention to the customers and took initiative to offer help. Very hardworking elderly lady. Other staff not as helpful, cashier was a little grumpy. Food is excellent as usual."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNXJQZ1lREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,Super friendly staff who goes beyond to make us feel welcome despite us reaching at 9pm+ for a late dinner. Special mention to the very cute auntie who came over and gave us more cucumbers and making sure we have enough rice! Will come back more often! Food is excellent as usual :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeXM2eG5BRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Superb service. I was initially confused when they didnt let me and my lil one sit at a vacant 2 seater, but realised they take seriously 1st come, first served and were planning to rearrange those seats for the group of 3 before us. They were also v kind to let me and my tired kid wait for seats inside at the sofa area and made my kid's day with a free lollipop. They cashier was very good in that she asked me first if it was ok, before offering the candy to my son. Very impressed by the service and kindness :) Thank you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2LXFxTWRnEAE,Boon Tong Kee,1,"Outlet in Compass One with no chicken left after 730pm. Poor Business ethics and failure to provide enough number of chickens to serve customers. Wondering if customers buy chicken is like Singapore is undergoing another Circuit Breaker or end of the world. Else the outlet will only sell chicken rice at SGD$100 or One whole chicken at SGD$1000. I can't believe that the outlet does not even have chicken drumstick rice which I wanted to buy for my three year old for her dinner.
Do avoid Compass One outlet by all means if you do not want to leave Boon Tong Kee empty handed or you do not want to get deceived by price in Menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX2JHYm93RRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,Totally will come back again. Very good service and the food is always so yummy! Staffs were very attentive and we're quick to top up drinks. They even bring extra continents when we din even ask for it. Love the fried beancurd! Must try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbDhXVnBRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,"Chicken is very smooth and tender, Fried beancurd was special and well-cooked. Ordered the Black pepper fish fillet, pretty nice sauce too! Egg was also very nice. Chilli and sauce all very good, but staff tends to be a little rough and noisy while clearing plates. Other than that it was a really good restaurant tho price might be a little on the high side, but very worth the quality"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaU1tVWRREAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,"love their steamed chicken, highly recommend 1/2 chicken for 2-3pax, with their chicken rice of course. the rice is a must-try, it goes wonderfully with their smooth, tender steamed chicken. also suggest their 3 egg spinach (苋菜) and thai style tofu. worth the money, i'm a frequent diner here for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ3ViLUl3EAE,Boon Tong Kee,5,Friendly staffs. Dishes are delightful. The chicken is one of the best I've had.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ck4tRXVBRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,5,"My toddler's chicken rice of choice - he loves it so much he proclaims chicken rice is now his favourite food of all time.

Also, the aunties and uncles working at the restaurant who pamper him always probably are factors influencing his proclamation. 😁"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjhXYnlRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee,3,Just ok for me. Honestly I felt quite pricey ($90+)for just 3 persons.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcGYzc2ZnEAE,Xing Hua 兴化,4,"Went twice for their crab promotion, only $59 for an order of crab (2pcs), fresh and delicious! Fish is fresh too but their steam fish is a bit bland to me. Overall I enjoyed it, for my both visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnM2aEhBEAE,Xing Hua 兴化,5,"It's a wonderful place when you have a family of young and old. Drop off elderly at LRT pick up point which is just outside restaurant. Sufficient big round tables for families. Park at hdb multistorey carpark beside seletar mall if you find mall parking too long queue or expensive.

Food is great here. Tasty, adequate servings, good service. They cook fast too.

Currently having promo 9.90 for  soon hock so good news for fish lovers.

The Heng hua thin bee hoon and lor mee suits different ages. Lychee meat will satisfy the young without fail, the special yam cubes for the older folks.

Give it a try esp if you're sick and tired of weekend crowd everywhere."

Food always good. We always order their beehoon and meesua and recently they added some items to their menu and their crabs promotion is very worth it and super tasty! I must say taste even better than some of the high rated seafood restaurant's crab. My mum loves their red wine chicken and my children loves their 辣子鸡! Will be back this weekend with my family! 👍🏻🙂
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxak9USVNREAE,Xing Hua 兴化,5,"Best xinghua food I've tasted so far. I personally find it better than putien even and priced very well.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Ml8yaDVBRRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,5,"Unexpected gem! Each dish we ordered were yummy, and served super quickly too 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

辣子鸡 was super crispy and flavourful! Cabbage fried rice sounded very normal but wow it was definitely a good plate of fried rice - recommend to try it! Everything else, like the lor mee, Xing hua bee hoon, 奶白 were above average too~

only the fried yam and duck roll were slightly disappointing, because the amount of duck in there was pretty insignificant.

will definitely return!"

She was extremely polite and helpful, never gave me the feeling of any impatient or frustration vibes when I actually asked her alot of question regard the costs, packaging of the food for take away etc.. I must admit that I took up quite a while of her times. Thank you Tong for your good services & recommendation of all dishes, my whole family really enjoyed all the dishes.
Good food at reasonable pricing..
will come back to dine in next time.."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnF6Uy1nRRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,1,"The worst service ever!!
Came early at 5.15pm to order a packet of XingHua Meehoon.
After ordering, waited there for quite long and was told it will probably take 45mins to an hour mall, so they told me to leave HP No. and will call when it’s ready.
After 2 hours later no call at all. It was 7.30pm. How can a packet of noodles take more than 2 hrs to cook!!
Went back to check on my order then found the food was cold and chucked at a corner.
Asked why they didn’t call, the staff shouted: Crazy, who has time to call you!!
I answered: You asked for my number and I waited for your call patiently.
She replied: it’s none of my business, you go ask the cook lah! It made me so angry. My neighbors also had similar experience!
The noodles were miserable at $13.40. Only crazy pple will eat there again!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M3BDb3NRRRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,5,Been to this place for many meals. Their lunch time promo of 20% discount is so worth it. The Xing Hua Bee Hoon is our favourite for quick lunch. Service is good and prompt too. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aWVIN3NRRRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,5,The customer service here is great and the waiting time is not considered long for me. The food is also very appetising and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXODYyUGd3RRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,5,"Underrated gem, my experience having a meal there not too long ago has been a pleasant one.

Food variety is good, and those i ordered were really tasty and had good portions. We had the seafood fried rice, spinach, lychee sweet and sour pork, and the xiao long bao, all of which i found were really good and i don't really have any criticism for any of them; all were freshly made to order and not overcooked. Special mention to the sweet and sour pork which was crispy on the outside and juicy pipping hot on the inside coated with the sweetness from the lychee and tomato-based sauce fused in one.

The service was also impeccable; the staffs there were so attentive and most of all polite. They were welcoming and quick to ensure we had a really pleasant dining experience by tending to our requests or query (on dishes) very promptly.

Really recommend for people, especially people around the neighbourhood to come by here and show them some support.

I myself will definitely consider to come by here more often for meals after having experience how good the food and service here is."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlem9MSUJREAE,Xing Hua 兴化,4,Taste and prices are good. Promo crab and sea bass are really good value.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybDk2X1lREAE,Xing Hua 兴化,5,"Very nice quiet place to drop by on weekdays . I believe this used to be the Xin Hua Lou in some Food courts which serves putien lor mee at a much cheaper price than PuTien.

The $8.90 bowl of lor mee was generously filled to the brim with lots of ingredients , we were really surprised it came with a 20% discount too on weekdays . In a period where prices are rising and everyone just jump on the bandwagon to take a cut , it’s heartening to see some eateries still doing their part to maintain fair pricing ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaklxYWdnRRAB,Xing Hua 兴化,5,Taste good and very satisfying portion. Razor clam was superb and the steam fish was good not fishy at all. 👍👍👍 polite and good service from Seletar Mall

Technology update: you can scan the qr code at the entrance to get the q number. Can be busy during lunch/dinner times. Be sure to come early."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NjkyRm1BRRAB,Din Tai Fung,3,"Din Tai Fung was an all time favourite for me for many years but this visit was a disappointment. The service is good as always but waiting time to get a table is still long.

The disappointment is with the xiao long bao and spicy dumplings. The xlb is not longer as flavoursome. The spicy dumplings are sticky together and tough where meat tastes like a flour dough more than pork. I used to love this dish and can have 2 bowls but now it is neither spicy nor sour.

On the lucky end, the fried rice with shrimps and chicken soup are still as good.

But as always and recently, everything is getting  pricey. For the price it is, it is not quite worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2ei1PWHJnRRAB,Din Tai Fung,3,"Had a little unpleasant experience from one of the (part time) staff who was chasing us out after 9pm. I had arrived at 8.30pm which was apparently the time for the last order and the food arrived at 8.45pm. I was expected to finish my food in 15 minutes which was frankly quite ridiculous. Perhaps they should move the last order time at least 1 hour before closing time or inform the customers about closing time before they make any orders.

In terms of food, the dumplings were not really well prepared compared to usual. You could tell they were left in the cold for awhile before serving and the skin were all stuck to each other. Tried the crab meat xlb for the first time and surprisingly it was quite good. An interesting seafood twist to the usual.

That said, it was just one unpleasant experience. The other staff were very friendly and professional throughout."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLM3FEcVpREAE,Din Tai Fung,5,"Always long queue but the serving speed is fast. Most of the dumplings are pre-made though as you can see the chefs keep making the dumpling behind the glass.

The queue management is ok. Just get the paper and wait for your queue. If you missed just tell and it will be your turn next. Most of the queues are about 30 minutes long at least.

Foods are good. There was one time I over-ordered a lot of dumplings because there are so many options. They were great until we were full. The truffles are a bit overpriced. One at $5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0pHR0tREAE,Din Tai Fung,4,Service is okay and food is average. Place is family friendly and recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDZ2R1T1Z3EAE,Din Tai Fung,4,"Good place to get consistent good quality xiao long bao  the rest of the dishes were quite yummy too lole the wanton in spicy sour sauce, the garlic paste pork and the zhajiangmian.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleUltN1N3EAE,Din Tai Fung,5,Been to this outlet many times.es probably once a week for dinner at about 8 plus. Never ever disappointed with the food especially the xiao long pau. I always  lazy to scan the QR code to place oder a d was always assisted by Su Fei in ordering.  She always serves with  a smile.  Keep it up!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cDhXNVpnEAE,Din Tai Fung,2,"It was lunch for two at Din Tai Fung in Seletar Mall.  The steamed basket containing 5 pieces of xiao long bao was an upset. The bao and minced pork within has shrunk in size and content to a small dollop of 4cm diameter easily gulped down in one mouthful. The noodles with sliced mushrooms was also an upset. It was soggy with soy sauce. The only salvos were the fried rice and pickled cucumber.
Didn't bother to take photos."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzejRTZnFRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,Food is pretty nice!! Strongly recommend their dimsum and prawn fried rice. The environment is atas and classy !

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdnFXRjBRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,5,What I love the most in din tai fung is their JA JIANG MIAN!!! don't forget to add their chilli and mix it tgt super duper yummy 😍 xiaolongbao is too mainstream I mean like everyone loves it and it's a must order too.  So let's talk about other food like the century eggs and the suan cai 👍 din tai fung never fail us NEVER!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcl8zY0NREAE,Din Tai Fung,5,"Food is definitely great. The chopped pork was juicy and rich with fat and paired well with its light egg fried rice. Earl grey lemon tea recommended. The steamed dumplings here are well done. Service and speed is up there, considering the volume of customers.
Can be a tad pricey, but the value is still okay. Also, it's open to the noise of the mall."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MnBqT1RREAE,Din Tai Fung,3,"Food was ok, would prefer it to be more flavorful. Service was very good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneV9IUzlnRRAB,Din Tai Fung,3,Slow service although the place is not crowded stepped in almost 4pm. Tried very hard to signal the waitresses but to no avail. Got to walk up to them to inform that we wanted to order. Food wise is as usual. Still as good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZdk5QZ1hnEAE,Din Tai Fung,5,"Always great. Always consistent. Super fats service. I recommend the spicy noodles, rice with egg and pork, spicy wonton, hot and sour soup, duck in crispy spring onion pastry"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHUyTVZ3EAE,Din Tai Fung,1,"Am utterly disappointed with the service I’ve just experience at Ding Tai Feng @ Seletar Mall. I’m physically queuing outside the restaurant at around 8.20pm but was denied entry by a petite looking lady, informing me that last order by 8.30pm - so left with with disappointment despite seeing a few empty tables just that no one bothers to clear them. But the next moment , I saw her allowing entry for another family. Just don’t understand … last order in 10mins defers between customers. Great disappointment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLVpXMXZRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,"Food quality has been consistent but soft skill of staff lacking over years. Unlike in their earlier days, staff are super attentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdWVQUXRRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,5,"I can't rate it any lower than 5 stars when the food is a 5 and service level a 6, can I?
I had my meal there just a few days ago and will not forget the incident when i accidentally dropped one of my chopsticks. It landed with a faint sound. I could not see where it landed so i decided to continue enjoying my delicious meal of egg fried rice with a spoon that was on the table. To me it was a non-event. But before i could continue with my meal,  a service staff appeared with a pair of chopsticks and placed it right in front of me. I was totally stunned. The attitude that 'nothing  is too small a task' 无微不至的态度when coming to service just overwhelmed me.  Thank you Din Tai Fung for the good food and the remarkable service. Yes ! I will be back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNUxpX2Z3EAE,Din Tai Fung,2,"Food quality has dropped tremendously.

1. Pork chop fried rice (pork still tender and juicy but rice is too oily)
2. XLB - Thick got thicker, less broth in the bao
3. Chicken broth - recipe has definitely changed. Tasted light with some msg.
4. Prawn wanton - fillings no longer tasty and thick skin

Service wise - super short handed though staff still friendly

Visited 19th Dec for lunch"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeXZLX0pnEAE,Din Tai Fung,4,"Food was good. Ordered the drunken chicken (cold dish), duck fried with some wrap (was oily), the Signature xiaolongbao (good), shrimp and bamboo shoot noodle (hardly any bamboo shoot). Friend said the fried rice with pork chop was good and really worth the price.
We were seated near the entrance so service not great cos the wait staff were usually not looking at our table. But once we got their attention they were good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpc2RqbHNRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,5,"Good food, order pork chop fried rice and the chicken soup"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbmRuOURBEAE,Din Tai Fung,4,"Superb food as always. Pricey, yes. Value for money, not too sure. The fried rice is to die for as always. But a little ex for a small little plate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMDk3ckVREAE,Din Tai Fung,1,"Slow service. Served all dishes and worse, served the fried rice last. They fried the rice one shot with other's orders. Which was unacceptable. And so, we have to wait too long despite the fact that we ordered first. The xiao long bao crabmeat smell tested not fresh and have many bones in it. Not juicy. Noodle portion was little. Fried rice tasted like no salt fried rice meant for kids. Dissapointed as hell. Just the name is big, but food not nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOWZUeHh3RRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,"ThevXiso Loong Pows were good...but the skin for Prawn Siew Mai failed in Quality, Taste and presentation.
The skin was just too thick...and spoiled the texture and eating experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdGZTM3h3RRAB,Din Tai Fung,5,hands down best place for dumplings. Not to mention their egg fried rice which is amazingly delicious and value for money !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdFpDRk1REAE,Din Tai Fung,5,"The restaurant is fantastic because the food is always consistently good. The restaurant is better than many of their other locations because the tables are widely spaced apart from each other, giving you lots of room to move around and chat without disturbing neighbors. I There is a long queue during dinner hours so come early or later."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNzl1VEtREAE,Din Tai Fung,5,"My favourite place for hot & sour soup, beef noodle & fried rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MjZhMHNBRRAB,Din Tai Fung,1,"Extremely poor service. Ordered take out during non peak season and was made to wait 45 mins. ( I was told the wait would be 10-15 mins). The worse was the food was just sitting at the counter and left cold, and none of the service staff bothered to call out for me. If I did not check with the counter I would have been waiting for eternity. To make this unpleasant experience even worse, the service staff still came up with excuses to justify for not calling out for the numbers. Ridiculous..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX3RXS3RBRRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,"It was a mother-son bonding time on Apr 2 and he wanted to have dinner here so we drove here (instead of walking) since it was drizzling.
I leave it to him to order his usual dishes as I'm easy.
We had to wait for at least 30 minutes so we walked around the mall and it was nearer our queue, they will ping us.
It has been some time since I frequent DTF and that was back in Tampines. This is my 1st time at Seletar Mall outlet and I think it is not as crowded and it looks as if the internal is more spacious as compared to the one at Tampines. Or was it because it's a late dinner, that's why...ha ha."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNktMQS1RRRAB,Din Tai Fung,1,"Ordered a few times, the food quality and taste is not as good as the Waterway Point one. Really annoying that most of the restaurants in Sengkang taste awful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNnV5ajBBRRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,There is no prior booking of table for lunch or dinner. Need to register and will given a queue number. Waiting time about 20 to 30 minutes depending on the crowd on that day.  While waiting you can choose your dish from the given menu list. This queue system is very good. Place is cosy and clean. The service is good and food serve very fast. We like the fried rice with chicken meat which is thick and plenty. Will come again with family.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOE8tb0x3EAE,Din Tai Fung,4,"Most branches we went are quite crowded esp on Friday & weekends. Nice choices of food, kids loves their dumplings, fried rice, chicken soup & loves to watch the chef makes the dumlings! Very long queues but their services are still fast enough!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZX3NMel9nRRAB,Din Tai Fung,4,"A worthwhile visit. Nice and sumptuous food is served at Din Tai Fung. I enjoy the beef noodles which has a super stock base for their soup, taste like essence of beef. The pork dumplings are my favourite as well. Enjoy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRaXNhS3JRRRAB,Din Tai Fung,3,"Staple dishes such as fried rice and noodles only has 1 size: personal size. Not a place for proper dinning, but more for dim sum and small eaters. Menu item seem limited. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Hope they improve on the food bit."

Nice mango pudding with mango bits inside, coconut milk on top goes really well"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM3FULVR3EAE,Din Tai Fung,4,"The food is good. Very well organised for taking orders, serving by chefs and the clearing. The disadvantage for non Chinese is many of the waiters do not speak in English. Should add salted agg buns and hot drinks eg hot lemongrass"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncklDWDJBRRAB,Din Tai Fung,5,"Really enjoy the food here. My family, especially my oldest son, loves the xiao long bao. I myself prefer the black vinegar chilli wontons.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVN3Flb0J3EAE,Din Tai Fung,5,Love their特香香菇面（Noodles in fragrant mushroom and minced pork sauce) and their shrimp and minced pork dumpling. My favourite orders everytime I visit the place. Love their outlet at Seletar Mall on weekdays m

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdzcyZTBRRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"This is to share my personal experience with GrabFood Singapore on Friday 5 July 2019. The food I ordered from GrabFood is from “Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice & Noodle (Sembawang Outlet). It is located at: Blk 463 Sembawang Drive, Sembawang Riverlodge, #01-01, Singapore 750463. This food store have several branches in Singapore.

I ordered a whole roasted duck as well as 1/2 kg (500 grams) of Char Siew via GrabFood at S$ 40.50 Nett (after using a S$20 Grab Coupon) for my family. When the food arrived and my mum open the packing, she found that the Char Siew is “extremely little” and suspected something is amiss. She then contacted me and I rushed home to attend to the matter.

I then took out my “Digital Weighing Machine” and found out to my horror that the Char Siew only weigh “360 grams”. I contacted Grab Hotline and was told to file an “online customer service support”, which I do so later.

As the food shop is nearby my house, I took the whole food package and paid them a visit. The shop staff don’t seemed to be bothered to my complain and directed me to call their person-in-charge (PIC). After several attempts, the PIC finally answered my phone call.

The food menu has indicated 1/2 Kg (i.e. 500 grams) for the Char Siew and why I am only given 360 grams? This is a shortage around 25%.

At the end, the food shop finally gave me a “300 grams of Char Siew” as a “make up” after a long wait around 30 minutes.

This case shouldn’t have happened. It is unknown and remain a question mark whether the food stall staff or the Grab delivery boy has short-changed or taken my “Char Siew” initially. A lot of time and effort have been wasted on this matter if the related party are sincere doing business ethically."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaTdPNU9nEAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"Both orders were take away.

The first time I ordered a whole chicken I thought it was my imagination that one drumstick was missing.
Ordered a whole chicken again today, my husband who is taller saw the staff place a drumstick and part of the breast back on the counter.
When we went back I checked and there was only one drumstick.

Very dishonest. I will be boycotting this store."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDXzdmUmVBEAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,5,1st time try this wanton noodle and I was very happy about it.  The char siew is well roasted and costed with a layer of honey.  Noodle is al dente.  Saurce is just right too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMmVLVkJBEAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"Food is good, but cleaniness is the key to everything in food. Found a plastic in my packed food. Not sure, if I am going back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZa3N1OXRBRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"Ever since they changed their store head, the taste is totally not right, starting from half cooked noodles (which both me and my mum couldn’t finish) to the soy sauce chicken having a mild curry flavour, I had really Nothing much to say apart from some decent soup of the day rather then having ghee water soup... they used to have very good soy sauce chicken which we always ordered a full chicken... what happened?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5XzdtUmdRRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"Bought 5 packets with mixture of duck, roasted pork, char siew, chinese sausage & 1 egg with rice but egg missing. Taste still can make it but the quality of the char siew is like giving me the whole fats. Meat is 5-10% but the fats is 90-95%. Duck meat is also more on bone than meat. Suggest not to tabao (packet) but eat there otherwise more will be missing like my egg. Rice is just plain rice not using chicken rice. Please patron the stall to confirm my reviews."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbE9LczlnRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"White chicken smells terrible, very bland, watery. Like they microwaved a frozen chicken. Horrible. Styrofoam boxes also have a lot of holes as if they have been melted."

Please educate your workers. Not well stay at home.
Case No. 63884 and 63886 were not well, yet still continue to go to work. The 27yo Malaysian (63886)  already developed loss of taste but DID NOT SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION!!!!! Now it's a cluster!!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdk1iMWZnEAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,I would rate zero star if can...ordered via foodpanda and the package missed out one of the add-on order. Taste wise so so...portion small and not worth the $$ value.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycC1qT0VREAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,Serve overnight roasted duck rice. Tasteless and tough. Service is poor and staff is rude.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbmJYb25RRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,Lousy packages. My char siew and roasted pork rice.. soggy with sauces. Order thru Deliveroo!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvaF9maU5REAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"Ordered the Roasted Duck Drumstick Rice through GrabFood, since it was stated ""top-rated"". While some parts of the meat look like drumstick, the others look like other parts of the duck. Besides there were plenty of bones, the meat was tough like chewing on rubber. The gravy was a bit too sweet. That was the first time I tried. It will be the last time I ordered anything from them as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdXU2a3BnRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,5,"Value for money.

Sometimes have to wait longer due to a long crowd during peak period.

Portion might be small for more than average eater."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOU1tcE5REAE,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,Ordered using Grabfood. Treasure signature combo($27+) and the Boneless duck & chicken ($20+) with free chicken. Only the free chicken potion is real whole chicken. Everything else very little.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMTdHMXhRRRAB,Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle,1,"This review is for the Serangoon View outlet which is not on map.

I ordered the dry char siew noodle. Discovered the noodle was submerged in a lot of chili oil which made the noodle inedible. Picture shows how much oil in the container after I separated the noodle. It was disgusting. The noodle was too oily to be consumed."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHazVuZjdBRRAB,Little Kitchen,5,"Fried rice (Chicken /pork) are good. The seafood fried noodles has a lovely  side of crispy and creamy mix to it.

The Deer meat curry and rice is  a good try as well .but would suggest to go for the pepper mix rather than sambhal..

All in all a good place to have chill out with drinks and food...Value for money too💲😃"

Upon reaching home,  ate both and realize that the meat inside clump together and completely not tasty.  The buns must have been  kept overnight and heated up again otherwise the meat ought to be loose.
Hence there isn't any quality control or seems to be lacking."
