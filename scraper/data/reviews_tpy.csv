ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM3RTbzhBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"The way Chinese Dim Sum meant to be served. Fast & efficient. I love that they have the same menu on the weekday and weekend. It gets really crowded on the weekends so come on a weekday if you can. You will not miss out on any items.

The porridge was particularly good on the day I visited. The service is simple and homely.

Enjoyed my meal there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MmEyQ1VnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Large seating area with plenty of space.
Glutinous rice is a mushy, flavorful rice. The porridge was particularly good on the day I visited. The service is simple and homely.

I didn't get to order the Egg Tart as I would think it is overpriced for 3 small tarts."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyLUpyOTZBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,Dim sum experience as close as how its supposed to be. Large seating area with plenty of space. Dim sum quality is great! Love the mini egg tarts especially. Expect to queue especially during weekend mornings where family gather for delicious Dim Sum breakfast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3RENzl3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Good service and good dim sum. including the porridge and carrot cake
The push cart is on during weekend for better efficiency.
Better enjoy during weekday
Their signature dishes are mostly good  with ngoh hiang fritter, braised duck and fried hor fun"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHE2N1lREAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Service is good, but is good to reserve the seat before heading down for dinner.
Location easy to find and been there for year so mostly people can locate the place
Parking just right behind of the library there is open car park.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPemJfU2RREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Located on the second story above Giant supermarket, you have to look for the stairs in the center of the building. There is a long queue and it starts from the stairs. We waited for about 35 minutes in the morning for the ala carte dim sum. You can order Teochew dishes from 11am onwards. There is a high tea dim sum buffet from 3-5pm.

The restaurant is spacious, have more than 50 seats and can serve large crowds. Ordering of food is done from the dim sum pushcarts when the staff pushes them around, told us what they have and asked if we want any. You can check with them if they have any of the items you want to order on their pushcarts. Staff was friendly and service was good and fast.

It is a nice experience to get the food like in the authentic Hong Kong dim sum restaurants, but you can't explore all the dishes as you do not know the menu / the dishes available and their prices. From what we spent, the dim sum is about $5.80 per item on average. The steamed items are cheaper than the fried ones."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXVyMXFnRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Swatow Restaurant served lovely Tea Dim Sum at Toa Payoh. Food are great with Pleasantly Courtesy Service staffs namely Madam Tee, Madam Chua (Da Mei)
Both always smiley and very efficient with their service.
In fact most of service officers were very polite."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPd3JEUU1BEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"I’ll share what I like about here, the service crew, an old aunty, brown bronze shoulder length hair, when we ask her why isn’t the steam bao troller coming, she offered to help us get the char siew and chee Chong fan, she’s also very attentive and responsive. As for the food quality, I’d say most of their ingredients are really fresh, especially in times like this. I’d highly recommend the char siew bao and siew mai, the fried food is above average.. I wouldn’t recommend the chee chong fan, because the char siew tasted frozen, but interestingly the char siew in the char siew bao is fresh. You can tell when the meat is not fresh because they will use a lot pepper in the meat, trying to cover the taste. Har Gao has a lot of pepper, skin is thick too. Porridge is rather blend, steam pork rib is fresh thou. The sesame mango prawn roll is pretty good too, thou the mango has not much taste. We spend about 60 ish for all the food in the photos provided. If you do intend to visit, I’d recommend you to make reservations."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyajRqLUpnEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"One of the creamiest roe, at one of the best prices for cold crab I’ve ever had. For the quality to value ratio, this is easily a 5 star rating, if not because of some disappointments.

Although the other dishes were good - average, the other 2 highlights were a little disappointing. The steamed promfret (0.9kg) was perhaps a little too big so the flesh was a little bit boring. I would opt for a smaller fish for a sweeter & more tender experience. The teochew style crayfish just didn’t suit my palette, it ended tasting like eating onion fried eggs… it’s ok but I wouldn’t order it again.

Overall, still a highly recommended place for casual meals!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNllMVHh3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Review for : Take away for dinner. +  weekday dim sum buffet.

Dimsum buffet: Book and start the buffet at 3pm. As with everyone else, you'll be given an appetiser and pot of tea before the ala carte dishes is served in push carts. Going when it first starts ensures that you get a portion of all the dishes available as the service progresses. The dishes are served in good timing and don't rush to have multiple servings of each dish, unless u really want to, as there's new dishes constantly up until the 1hr20mins-ish mark where desserts start. Some dishes were a hit, (custard bun, red bean banana roll, char siew bao, siew mai, fish skin) some were mediocre (lotus glutinous rice, century egg porridge, egg tart). But otherwise, it's good value. Definitely worth it, had 20ish dishes between the 2 of us. We were super stuffed just an hr in.

Take away dinner: the lady taking our order was frank with regards to what dishes were good to order as take away. Generally, the food was decent, the duck was flavorful and tender. Radish fried kway teow was flavourful, altho the small portion was half size that of the small portion of the eefu. The sesame pork was a little disappointing, as it was just roasted sesame salad sauce with pork, not unique or memorable, can pass. * Note: takeaway orders have 20% off for almost all dishes. Offer not valid for delivery or dine in. Validity till unknown."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXc19UU1B3EAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Spent our Sunday morning having #Dimsum
🥟
It has been a long time since we last came. Service is prompt and dimsum taste pretty ok. There is a lot of variety and service is prompt in serving. A bit pricey but overall it is decent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdkpYaW1RRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Impeccable service - staff were very friendly and polite. They were also extremely attentive and kept refilling the tea.

Cold crab was good, other food was pretty mediocre. Chicken was extremely salty.

5 stars for the service, 3.5 stars for the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcDhiQThBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"We will bring our family here for dim sums, thus this will be a frequent visit for us. Glutinous rice is a mushy, flavorful rice. The crystal veg bun is fluffy and somewhat spicy. Siew Mai is a lovely. The lui Sai bun is fantastic. I enjoy their egg tarts as well, but I was unable to order egg tarts and mini Xiao long bao this time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNEwtWWpRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"Got chased out of the place because we spent more than the 90 mins that was given to us.

I understand the logic when there's a long queue waiting for tables but what we are seeing is there's plenty of tables with no queue at all.

We were still taking our time to eat and intend to continue ordering more, but since their business is ""so good"" to the extent they need to chase customers out, i guess i have to find other options next time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcVA3QkVnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Dim Sum buffet. They serve pretty fast, keeping coming to the table with offer of different dishes; we don't even need to call for waitress. We end up with 13 dishes + 2 dessert. (We rejected a few other dishes becuz too full). The prawns are fresh,  baos are nice. Only setback is the pork ribs which is abit too salty. The fried red bean + banana pancake was abit too sweet. Worth going back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dnJpRFpREAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Dim sum buffet for $28.80++ from 3pm to 5pm

Tea included with around 30 dishes + dessert to choose from..

No need to order.. Aunty push dishes to you.. Wan how many just tell aunty..

At this price.. With nice food.. Good service..

Can come again!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHalpQTDZRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,3,"Food was okay, but on the pricy side. The service was prompt and the vibes was right for a Chinese restaurant. Was there for a weekday lunch, and it was relatively busy. I’d suggest the weekend dim sum buffet instead for under $40. It’s more value for the money you’re paying."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM2FlRHdBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"I’m reviewing the dim sum buffet that is available on weekdays 3pm-5pm. Their style is they will serve dish by dish via push carts instead of ordering yourself. And when all dishes are served, there will be a ‘last order’.

The problem came when they served the Xiao Long Bao, I told the server to give our table 4 trays, but to my surprise there are only 2 pieces per tray. But all other dim sums have 3 pieces?? Hence it’s not enough for my table so I ask another staff to get us more xlb, but she said there will be last order soon and we can order as many as we want. Ok. So during the last order, I asked for 8 trays of xlb and nothing else, 10mins later the staff came out and apologise that there are no more xlb. Erm….. I’m paying for a ‘buffet’, I don’t understanding what they mean no more xlb, if no more then the chefs can make more right?
Really made me lose face since I’m the organiser, my table some eat 1 piece some eat 2 pieces only, despite being a ‘buffet’.

Most of the food was great though. Maintained the same standard as during my last visit before covid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMGVLV1RnEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"This is the best Push Cart DIM SUM buffet that I ever had in Singapore. The restaurant looks exactly like Yam Cha place. We have 1.5hrs to gets the foods and even the waitress will come to you for the last orders, so that you can order your favourite dishes as a happy ending! I like their Xiao Long Bao,Golden Custard Pau, Har Kao,Siew Mai,Paper Wrapped with Chicken,chicken claws with spices,fried spring roll and crispy shrimps dumpling. I love their dessert especially the Red Bean Paste and banan pastry and Sweet Almond longan.The price is $67.80 for 2 pax (included GST and service charges) which I think it is quite reasonable and value for money.I definitely will visit Swatow Seafoods again when craving for Dim Sum even though it is far from my living place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWJEM1F3EAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Good dim sum place in the mature Toa Payoh housing estate. Location is so accessible.  There is also a lift, albeit a very basic and simple model for those who need assistance.  Just give a call to the number for assistance.
Glad that the management is able to pull through the Covid period.  Saw many families, old & young."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeXBXNWtBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,3,"Some food nice some food not so nice.
The service okok but we were placed at a corner of the restaurant and the push cart didnt go to our side so we gotta wait very long to order our food. And you can only order your food via the push cart. I also dont know why the push cart didnt go around the restaurant systematically."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2I2cmZnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Pretty good selection at the dim sum buffet, very friendly and helpful staff as well. Carts came around quite frequently with new dishes still warm in their steamers. Worth the money for a good gathering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNk5LMWlRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"The cold crab is ok but the rest is not nice. I had lowered my standard but still fail beyond commercial standard.The teochew fried kway teow, oyster omelet n especially the  signature pomfret is totally disappointed. Poor taste. I think my wife, a housewife can cook very much better. Dun understand such a popular teochew restaurant provide such low standard. Too surprise to me liao. How to go back?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbGVMc1FnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Personal favorite cold crab (not cheap), braised duck and cai Poh Kueh teow and orrh nee. The rest of the dishes are okie."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjdPS0x3EAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Spent about $195 for 5 pax for afternoon teochew dim sum. The braised duck was a bit chewy but tasty. The signature steamed chicken is also not as tender as I expected. The yam paste with pumpkin dessert was not too sweet or oily, just nice for elderly people with delicate pallette. Honestly I wouldn't say the dim sum was that great, I still prefer Cantonese styled dim sum at places like Tim Ho Wan etc. Overall, quite reasonable for the price. Reservations at least 3 weeks in advance recommended but for walk in customers, arriving after 1pm is better (less crowded) especially on weekends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGFldkJREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"We ordered the set menu for 6 comprising, crispy fish skin topping on salad with sliced baby abalone, shark fin in egg broth, steamed promfret, prawn with tofu broth, vegetables with mushrooms, and yam paste dessert. We swapped the chicken dish for sliced goose meat snd ordered an additional dish of teochew fried kuay teow with diced spring onions snd crispy fried pork lard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaE1fbklREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"We went at around 1+pm and our last order is at 145pm for the dim sums as we need to vacate out by 2.30pm so that they can prepare for the 3pm buffet dim sum.

Food is good, except for the egg tart that is not those that don't have many crispy layers,  chicken feet is nice but can be softer,  I feel that they did not cook long enough, as for the rest of the dishes are good,  spring roll are crispy,  deep fried wanton is nice,  carrot cake with xo sauce,  century egg porridge,  fried prawn with mango also very nice.  I don't really like their chee cheong fan as the cha siew got a little bit of the pork smell which I'm scare of.  The cha siew bao is nice,  the lotus rice is nice too.  If you love to eat dim sum at a reasonable price,  you can come here or other outlets to try it out.  Service is fast and food serving is fast too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaVpxREFREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Authentic teochew restaurant. Dim sum are served in push cart trolley. We love their Liu Sha Bao, Zhi ma bao, Zhu jiao chu, the rest of the items are also okay. The waitresses are very friendly too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcHJxWTJ3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Best!! Love the dimsum buffet! They literally flood your table with food!! The siew mai is one of the best I have tried. With flounder powder. True teochew style. Dimsum are served hot, fresh prawns filling! Aunties are super friendly. Love the place. Will refer it to all my friends!!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMDc3RTBBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,3,"If you are craving push cart dimsum this is one of the few places that serves it, they start 8am.

Food quality is average The skin of har gow is so so n thick .  Seafood Bamboo roll was nice .  But found the char siew Chee Cheong fun to have porky smell ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcU96WlBnEAE,Swatow Seafood,1,Food is terrible. waiting 1.5hr only server 2 out of 8 dishes my kids are hungry. this restaurant put coriander in the sharkfin soup ruin the taste. pepper shaker also doesn’t work. upsetting.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeTl1aGFREAE,Swatow Seafood,5,having a set dinner for two costs $48++. It is worth it. I love all dishes. It's nice and more than enough for two people. It is highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjlUUDdnRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Usually enjoy the century egg porridge, red bean banana and crystal dumplings here (not at our recent visit however). Find the other standard items - siew mai, har kao, char siew bao, liu sha bao, carrot cake - quite average. Not a fan of the egg tart (neither buttery nor flaky) or chee cheong fun (too thick).

We visited a few times in the last 2 years when they stopped push cart service. Now that they have resumed that, satisfaction has dropped somewhat. The fried items were dripping in oil. Given earlier experiences, will give it another shot before revising ratings downwards."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNnFITWd3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"Service is more of a miss recently, and I feel the food standards have dropped tremendously of late.

The most disappointing thing is having 3 wait staff insist that it's ""normal"" for fried food to come drenched in oil. The paper liner is glazed full of oil.

Similar to our recent previous visit, I've also had to repeatedly chase the servers for status for the 1 last dish. It's really odd how they leave one last dish hanging like that, we just sat around having finished everything we've ordered but waiting for that one *final* dish.

Always visited in the morning ala carte dimsum period, but I guess not anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OFk2c3hRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Confirmed and chopped! Authentic push cart dim sum! Besides Red Star, this is the only other place with old style push cart service that I know of. And I have been looking for this on both sides of the border for some time now.

The dim sum still taste good after all these years. Not mind blowingly good but comfortably adhering to the taste you are used to and familiar with. The selection is somewhat limited and this is understandable due to manpower constraints. But they do have all the popular items like Siew Mai, Har Gao, Braised Chicken Feet, Steamed Pork Ribs, Char Siew Buns, Beancurd Skin Wraps, Chee Cheong Fun and Century Egg / Sliced Pork Porridge. Notably missing were Radish Cake and Lotus Leaf Wrapped Glutinous Rice. The one complain I have would be their rule for 90 mins service limit for each table, although I don’t really see them enforcing it.

Opens from 8am daily so yes, this is the one place in Singapore where you can enjoy a yum cha culture closest to that of Hong Kong. Call it nostalgia but the push cart system is a huge winner for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNWNfZjRRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Enjoyed eating at this very traditional Teochew restaurant. The duck with tofu was great. Enjoyed the steam pomfret fish. Very fresh. The crawfish is good, pretty unique. The onions in it very nice. The egg with oyster nice. Their gravy has the oyster taste in it. Yam dessert was ok. Chicken was ok. The good thing is it’s super spacious. You could use some private room for karaoke as well. They serve dim sum too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NU9XdG5nRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Nice, authentic and Affordable price for Teochew cuisine with dim sum"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa1pXNU9nEAE,Swatow Seafood,1,"Expect half the menu to be out of stock.

The waitress claimed it is because today “business was too good”. Excuse me, we have been sitting here since 7pm and your restaurant has not been full at any point of time.

At 8.30pm, they are left with 3 dessert options out of a list of more than 12. That’s 25%"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnNyVmpBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"My third trip to this restaurant, tried ordering the al carte menu. We ordered their famous Swatow Chicken which is really good, the flesh is tender and skin is smooth and melt in your mouth. The steam minced pork with salted fish is another dish not to be missed. Well flavored with slight hint of salted fish taste. The most surprising dish is the Teochew Kai Lan Fried Kuay Teow with Preserved Radish. Loved the char flavor and rice noodle is not overly oily. The preserved radish just add another dimension to the dish. Loved it and looking to come back and have it second time.

Sawtow seafood, been here twice with my parents to have Tim Sum. It is great that they have lift for elderly so don't have to walk up the stairs. Spacious dinning area, Tim Sum spread is fine with plenty of selection, however I prefer that they have a menu for customer to choice and they bring to our table instead having to wait for the server to push the cart and pick whatever you like. It also took me more than 10 minutes to settle my bills. Wish they have better work processes to make it more efficient for customer as well their employees. Very old school Chinese restaurant."

I was there with family at 2.00pm but was shouted by a staff who claimed that last order is at 2pm., she addressed us as HALO , HALO when we were about to walk into the restaurant, saying that last order closed, but the lady at the reception was nicer, approached us and told us to come at 3pm for the buffet.  The staff need to be trained on how to approached the customer in a nicer way than to behave like she is in the market place,  Please educate your staff."

This restaurant is quite spacious in all but not cooling enough.

We went for weekend buffet.  The restaurant was almost fully occupied; partly as being a Saturday, secondly there will be no dine-in from Sunday onwards.

The food were served very quickly by  push-carts crews.  There were quite a variety of food to opt for.  We did not take up some of the food offered in order not to waste.

The chicken feets if cooked in a little spicy way will be best.
The food and desserts were fine so far."

We going again next week! 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdnJyNXFRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Tried the Dim Sum and overall good experience. The pan fried Carrot Cake has good sear on it for favour and taste. The Salted Egg Lava Bun was so-so, didn't have that good oozing of the salted egg lava."

Enjoyed my meal there."

Parking just right behind of the library there is open car park.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPemJfU2RREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Located on the second story above Giant supermarket, you have to look for the stairs in the center of the building. There is a long queue and it starts from the stairs. We waited for about 35 minutes in the morning for the ala carte dim sum. You can order Teochew dishes from 11am onwards. There is a high tea dim sum buffet from 3-5pm.

The restaurant is spacious, have more than 50 seats and can serve large crowds. Ordering of food is done from the dim sum pushcarts when the staff pushes them around, told us what they have and asked if we want any. You can check with them if they have any of the items you want to order on their pushcarts. Staff was friendly and service was good and fast.

It is a nice experience to get the food like in the authentic Hong Kong dim sum restaurants, but you can't explore all the dishes as you do not know the menu / the dishes available and their prices. From what we spent, the dim sum is about $5.80 per item on average. The steamed items are cheaper than the fried ones."

Both always smiley and very efficient with their service.
In fact most of service officers were very polite."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPd3JEUU1BEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"I’ll share what I like about here, the service crew, an old aunty, brown bronze shoulder length hair, when we ask her why isn’t the steam bao troller coming, she offered to help us get the char siew and chee Chong fan, she’s also very attentive and responsive. As for the food quality, I’d say most of their ingredients are really fresh, especially in times like this. I’d highly recommend the char siew bao and siew mai, the fried food is above average.. I wouldn’t recommend the chee chong fan, because the char siew tasted frozen, but interestingly the char siew in the char siew bao is fresh. You can tell when the meat is not fresh because they will use a lot pepper in the meat, trying to cover the taste. Har Gao has a lot of pepper, skin is thick too. Porridge is rather blend, steam pork rib is fresh thou. The sesame mango prawn roll is pretty good too, thou the mango has not much taste. We spend about 60 ish for all the food in the photos provided. If you do intend to visit, I’d recommend you to make reservations."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyajRqLUpnEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"One of the creamiest roe, at one of the best prices for cold crab I’ve ever had. For the quality to value ratio, this is easily a 5 star rating, if not because of some disappointments.

Although the other dishes were good - average, the other 2 highlights were a little disappointing. The steamed promfret (0.9kg) was perhaps a little too big so the flesh was a little bit boring. I would opt for a smaller fish for a sweeter & more tender experience. The teochew style crayfish just didn’t suit my palette, it ended tasting like eating onion fried eggs… it’s ok but I wouldn’t order it again.

Overall, still a highly recommended place for casual meals!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNllMVHh3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Review for : Take away for dinner. +  weekday dim sum buffet.

Dimsum buffet: Book and start the buffet at 3pm. As with everyone else, you'll be given an appetiser and pot of tea before the ala carte dishes is served in push carts. Going when it first starts ensures that you get a portion of all the dishes available as the service progresses. The dishes are served in good timing and don't rush to have multiple servings of each dish, unless u really want to, as there's new dishes constantly up until the 1hr20mins-ish mark where desserts start. Some dishes were a hit, (custard bun, red bean banana roll, char siew bao, siew mai, fish skin) some were mediocre (lotus glutinous rice, century egg porridge, egg tart). But otherwise, it's good value. Definitely worth it, had 20ish dishes between the 2 of us. We were super stuffed just an hr in.

Take away dinner: the lady taking our order was frank with regards to what dishes were good to order as take away. Generally, the food was decent, the duck was flavorful and tender. Radish fried kway teow was flavourful, altho the small portion was half size that of the small portion of the eefu. The sesame pork was a little disappointing, as it was just roasted sesame salad sauce with pork, not unique or memorable, can pass. * Note: takeaway orders have 20% off for almost all dishes. Offer not valid for delivery or dine in. Validity till unknown."

🥟
It has been a long time since we last came. Service is prompt and dimsum taste pretty ok. There is a lot of variety and service is prompt in serving. A bit pricey but overall it is decent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdkpYaW1RRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Impeccable service - staff were very friendly and polite. They were also extremely attentive and kept refilling the tea.

Cold crab was good, other food was pretty mediocre. Chicken was extremely salty.

5 stars for the service, 3.5 stars for the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcDhiQThBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"We will bring our family here for dim sums, thus this will be a frequent visit for us. Glutinous rice is a mushy, flavorful rice. The crystal veg bun is fluffy and somewhat spicy. Siew Mai is a lovely. The lui Sai bun is fantastic. I enjoy their egg tarts as well, but I was unable to order egg tarts and mini Xiao long bao this time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNEwtWWpRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"Got chased out of the place because we spent more than the 90 mins that was given to us.

I understand the logic when there's a long queue waiting for tables but what we are seeing is there's plenty of tables with no queue at all.

We were still taking our time to eat and intend to continue ordering more, but since their business is ""so good"" to the extent they need to chase customers out, i guess i have to find other options next time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcVA3QkVnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Dim Sum buffet. They serve pretty fast, keeping coming to the table with offer of different dishes; we don't even need to call for waitress. We end up with 13 dishes + 2 dessert. (We rejected a few other dishes becuz too full). The prawns are fresh,  baos are nice. Only setback is the pork ribs which is abit too salty. The fried red bean + banana pancake was abit too sweet. Worth going back again"

At this price.. With nice food.. Good service..

Can come again!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHalpQTDZRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,3,"Food was okay, but on the pricy side. The service was prompt and the vibes was right for a Chinese restaurant. Was there for a weekday lunch, and it was relatively busy. I’d suggest the weekend dim sum buffet instead for under $40. It’s more value for the money you’re paying."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM2FlRHdBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"I’m reviewing the dim sum buffet that is available on weekdays 3pm-5pm. Their style is they will serve dish by dish via push carts instead of ordering yourself. And when all dishes are served, there will be a ‘last order’.

The problem came when they served the Xiao Long Bao, I told the server to give our table 4 trays, but to my surprise there are only 2 pieces per tray. But all other dim sums have 3 pieces?? Hence it’s not enough for my table so I ask another staff to get us more xlb, but she said there will be last order soon and we can order as many as we want. Ok. So during the last order, I asked for 8 trays of xlb and nothing else, 10mins later the staff came out and apologise that there are no more xlb. Erm….. I’m paying for a ‘buffet’, I don’t understanding what they mean no more xlb, if no more then the chefs can make more right?
Really made me lose face since I’m the organiser, my table some eat 1 piece some eat 2 pieces only, despite being a ‘buffet’.

Most of the food was great though. Maintained the same standard as during my last visit before covid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMGVLV1RnEAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"This is the best Push Cart DIM SUM buffet that I ever had in Singapore. The restaurant looks exactly like Yam Cha place. We have 1.5hrs to gets the foods and even the waitress will come to you for the last orders, so that you can order your favourite dishes as a happy ending! I like their Xiao Long Bao,Golden Custard Pau, Har Kao,Siew Mai,Paper Wrapped with Chicken,chicken claws with spices,fried spring roll and crispy shrimps dumpling. I love their dessert especially the Red Bean Paste and banan pastry and Sweet Almond longan.The price is $67.80 for 2 pax (included GST and service charges) which I think it is quite reasonable and value for money.I definitely will visit Swatow Seafoods again when craving for Dim Sum even though it is far from my living place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWJEM1F3EAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Good dim sum place in the mature Toa Payoh housing estate. Location is so accessible.  There is also a lift, albeit a very basic and simple model for those who need assistance.  Just give a call to the number for assistance.
Glad that the management is able to pull through the Covid period.  Saw many families, old & young."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeXBXNWtBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,3,"Some food nice some food not so nice.
The service okok but we were placed at a corner of the restaurant and the push cart didnt go to our side so we gotta wait very long to order our food. And you can only order your food via the push cart. I also dont know why the push cart didnt go around the restaurant systematically."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2I2cmZnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Pretty good selection at the dim sum buffet, very friendly and helpful staff as well. Carts came around quite frequently with new dishes still warm in their steamers. Worth the money for a good gathering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNk5LMWlRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"The cold crab is ok but the rest is not nice. I had lowered my standard but still fail beyond commercial standard.The teochew fried kway teow, oyster omelet n especially the  signature pomfret is totally disappointed. Poor taste. I think my wife, a housewife can cook very much better. Dun understand such a popular teochew restaurant provide such low standard. Too surprise to me liao. How to go back?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbGVMc1FnEAE,Swatow Seafood,5,"Personal favorite cold crab (not cheap), braised duck and cai Poh Kueh teow and orrh nee. The rest of the dishes are okie."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjdPS0x3EAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"Spent about $195 for 5 pax for afternoon teochew dim sum. The braised duck was a bit chewy but tasty. The signature steamed chicken is also not as tender as I expected. The yam paste with pumpkin dessert was not too sweet or oily, just nice for elderly people with delicate pallette. Honestly I wouldn't say the dim sum was that great, I still prefer Cantonese styled dim sum at places like Tim Ho Wan etc. Overall, quite reasonable for the price. Reservations at least 3 weeks in advance recommended but for walk in customers, arriving after 1pm is better (less crowded) especially on weekends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGFldkJREAE,Swatow Seafood,4,"We ordered the set menu for 6 comprising, crispy fish skin topping on salad with sliced baby abalone, shark fin in egg broth, steamed promfret, prawn with tofu broth, vegetables with mushrooms, and yam paste dessert. We swapped the chicken dish for sliced goose meat snd ordered an additional dish of teochew fried kuay teow with diced spring onions snd crispy fried pork lard."

Food is good, except for the egg tart that is not those that don't have many crispy layers,  chicken feet is nice but can be softer,  I feel that they did not cook long enough, as for the rest of the dishes are good,  spring roll are crispy,  deep fried wanton is nice,  carrot cake with xo sauce,  century egg porridge,  fried prawn with mango also very nice.  I don't really like their chee cheong fan as the cha siew got a little bit of the pork smell which I'm scare of.  The cha siew bao is nice,  the lotus rice is nice too.  If you love to eat dim sum at a reasonable price,  you can come here or other outlets to try it out.  Service is fast and food serving is fast too."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeTl1aGFREAE,Swatow Seafood,5,having a set dinner for two costs $48++. It is worth it. I love all dishes. It's nice and more than enough for two people. It is highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjlUUDdnRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Usually enjoy the century egg porridge, red bean banana and crystal dumplings here (not at our recent visit however). Find the other standard items - siew mai, har kao, char siew bao, liu sha bao, carrot cake - quite average. Not a fan of the egg tart (neither buttery nor flaky) or chee cheong fun (too thick).

We visited a few times in the last 2 years when they stopped push cart service. Now that they have resumed that, satisfaction has dropped somewhat. The fried items were dripping in oil. Given earlier experiences, will give it another shot before revising ratings downwards."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNnFITWd3RRAB,Swatow Seafood,2,"Service is more of a miss recently, and I feel the food standards have dropped tremendously of late.

The most disappointing thing is having 3 wait staff insist that it's ""normal"" for fried food to come drenched in oil. The paper liner is glazed full of oil.

Similar to our recent previous visit, I've also had to repeatedly chase the servers for status for the 1 last dish. It's really odd how they leave one last dish hanging like that, we just sat around having finished everything we've ordered but waiting for that one *final* dish.

Always visited in the morning ala carte dimsum period, but I guess not anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OFk2c3hRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,5,"Confirmed and chopped! Authentic push cart dim sum! Besides Red Star, this is the only other place with old style push cart service that I know of. And I have been looking for this on both sides of the border for some time now.

The dim sum still taste good after all these years. Not mind blowingly good but comfortably adhering to the taste you are used to and familiar with. The selection is somewhat limited and this is understandable due to manpower constraints. But they do have all the popular items like Siew Mai, Har Gao, Braised Chicken Feet, Steamed Pork Ribs, Char Siew Buns, Beancurd Skin Wraps, Chee Cheong Fun and Century Egg / Sliced Pork Porridge. Notably missing were Radish Cake and Lotus Leaf Wrapped Glutinous Rice. The one complain I have would be their rule for 90 mins service limit for each table, although I don’t really see them enforcing it.

Opens from 8am daily so yes, this is the one place in Singapore where you can enjoy a yum cha culture closest to that of Hong Kong. Call it nostalgia but the push cart system is a huge winner for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNWNfZjRRRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"Enjoyed eating at this very traditional Teochew restaurant. The duck with tofu was great. Enjoyed the steam pomfret fish. Very fresh. The crawfish is good, pretty unique. The onions in it very nice. The egg with oyster nice. Their gravy has the oyster taste in it. Yam dessert was ok. Chicken was ok. The good thing is it’s super spacious. You could use some private room for karaoke as well. They serve dim sum too"

The waitress claimed it is because today “business was too good”. Excuse me, we have been sitting here since 7pm and your restaurant has not been full at any point of time.

At 8.30pm, they are left with 3 dessert options out of a list of more than 12. That’s 25%"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnNyVmpBRRAB,Swatow Seafood,4,"My third trip to this restaurant, tried ordering the al carte menu. We ordered their famous Swatow Chicken which is really good, the flesh is tender and skin is smooth and melt in your mouth. The steam minced pork with salted fish is another dish not to be missed. Well flavored with slight hint of salted fish taste. The most surprising dish is the Teochew Kai Lan Fried Kuay Teow with Preserved Radish. Loved the char flavor and rice noodle is not overly oily. The preserved radish just add another dimension to the dish. Loved it and looking to come back and have it second time.

Sawtow seafood, been here twice with my parents to have Tim Sum. It is great that they have lift for elderly so don't have to walk up the stairs. Spacious dinning area, Tim Sum spread is fine with plenty of selection, however I prefer that they have a menu for customer to choice and they bring to our table instead having to wait for the server to push the cart and pick whatever you like. It also took me more than 10 minutes to settle my bills. Wish they have better work processes to make it more efficient for customer as well their employees. Very old school Chinese restaurant."

The food were served very quickly by  push-carts crews.  There were quite a variety of food to opt for.  We did not take up some of the food offered in order not to waste.

The chicken feets if cooked in a little spicy way will be best.

Different outlet's chefs perform differently hence we have favourite outlets. Our first choice used to be at Holland Village. Another favourite haunt is the one at Ngee Ann City.

Recently, we've been ordering from their Toa Payoh outlet for home delivery. Although the experience is not as good as in-house dining, the convenience and quality of the takeout more than makes up for it.

My grandchildren love their beef so we usually order 2 portions. Another favourite dish we would order in twos is the four season beans. The lion head meatball stew is delicious but I prefer a more meaty bite. I find them a little mushy for my taste but perhaps the young children and older folks may like it that way. The tofu stew is also very delicious. I appreciate that they pack the sweet and sour fish sauce separately from the fried fish. Overall, we are happy with our delivered meals and will continue to order from this outlet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3N6cXF3RRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,5,"Love coming here to chill with the family because it’s spacious and quiet, away from the crowd especially on weekends.

First time trying the la mian with chilled poached chicken Szechuan style and it’s good! Everything blend well together, have it with steamed dumplings and you have a complete meal.

The kids meal comes with a generous portion and the prawn dumplings are filled with meat fillings and prawns. Sweet potato bun is beautiful to look at and sweet too, not my kids favourite but I like it 😂😂 Kids meal comes with a free drink too :)"

The soup for Dan Dan mian was way too thick, and spicy too. Don’t mind the spiciness, but the soup was a too “jelak”. Order the fried duck, it was good. But portion is too small for the price I feel. The salted egg custard bao was the best dish we had. Hence the 3 stars."

You have to keep chasing ""what's happening to my XLB?"". It looks like they prefer that you filled your stomach with their 2 complementary bowls of la mien and a side dish which you are not allow reject.

After long waiting in between orders, you begin to feel full and your marginal utility drop drastically and hence lost appetite for more XLB.

So be careful not to fall for this type of promotional gimmick which wasn't sincere at all.

Writing them off after this bad experience. Sigh !!!"

The braised Dong Po Pork Belly with lotus bun is worth a try - it’s nice and tender and almost melts in your mouth. The sautéed Shanghai rice flour cake is average but the rice flour definitely is light on the bite which is rare to come by. This place is hidden from the main view so you need look out as you walk by.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNi1QTV9BRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,Ordered through Foodpanda. Did not pack the ginger that goes with the Xiao long pau. Even tip a idelivery rider to request for extra ginger. Not even get a single slice of ginger!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRa2VqaFZREAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,Crystal jade jiangnan specialises in la mien and does it well. The menu also includes some cantonese cuisine and dim sum.  Some lovely dishes that I would go back for more would by the seafood crispy noodles and multi grain fried rice and the xiao long bao. The chunky seafood with its gravy was thoughtfully set aside to prevent the crispy noodles from turning soft too quickly. I like generous chunks of fish squid mushrooms prawns and a dash of leafy green that made this dish a seafood haven. It was well executed without being overly salty. That goes the same for the multi grain brown rice that was well cooked and presented in a stone bowl. Absolutely delicious and very healthy indeed! They have a spread of various types of xiaolong bao but I would recommend the normal flavour that allows you to experience the delicate yet flavorful pork infused with a delicious broth and sealed within the dumpling.  I wasn't too impressed with the lao sao bao which had very little filling making it rather dry;  and the ying yang steamed dumpling that had the skin too thick and the filling devoid of flavour. Service is alright though it would be ideal to make reservations if the group is large due to the small seating area.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBby1yWUl3EAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,One of the many Crystal Jade outlets serving traditional Chinese cuisine from the different provinces of China. Food quality is decent and certainly good valued. Won't blow a hole in the wallet. Service is quite efficient even during peak hours. 3.5 stars
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aVlhMktREAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,5,"nice place, lots of menu choices"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRM3Q3WXpBRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4,"Since this is rather close to my office, I have been there about 2-3 times.

Service is pretty alright, the service staff is prompt in refilling our tea and would recommend us dishes each time (but they won’t let us know if we over ordered, so have to really gauge yourself).

Food wise is okay, portion is generous even when it’s $1 promotional dishes. The fried veggies were quite nice, xiao long pao tasted so-so."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHQtMVJBEAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4,"Good quality dishes at ok prices. Xiao long bao is priced wayyy too expensive than other similar restaurants though it's delicious.

Love their crispy scallion prata dish. Yes it's just roti prata but they made it so crispy it's irresistible. 炸酱面 is also quite different from other places I've eaten at, but good.

Don't order the drunken chicken. It uses too much Chinese wine.

Tea and wet towels are chargeable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRODUtaG9BRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4,"Glad to get a table for 4 with no dinner reservation. Lo hei is good, generous portion even we ordered small. Service is great, staffs are very patient and paid special attention to serve peanuts and sesame separately for our friend with allergy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROWM3MFdnEAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"This... is one of the worst crystal jade I’ve ever eaten at. I could go on and on about how bad the food is. The shanghai nian gao was totally off putting. It looks terrible and tastes worse. It’s bland, sweet and ugly all at the same time. Jelly fish was too soggy. The promotional item, hainanese xiao long bao tastes like dessert meat. It’s oh so sweet. The crispy fried beancurd skin was seeping in oil. Drunkard chicken is tough and salty. The har gao is too peppery and beneath the peppery mask is soggy smelly prawns. The worst thing? The damage for all these is $80++"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyai1qeW9nRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"This place is one of those which begs for help during covid but ignore u when business is back to normal. When me and my colleagues went there to eat, we spent about 100 plus with drinks included. While eating at chatting, as long as one person food is finished the waitress immediately clear the plate while others are still eating. It gives the rest of the people pressure to eat faster. Yes granted there was a queue outside but we have been there since covid period to support. But when business oicks up, they keep clearing your plates while others are eating. Hinting to u that u should leave soon. Problem is drinks are refillable for tea at it cost 3dollars per cup. Yet while we are still chatting and drinking they keep the cups too. This for me is too much. Come up to us and tell us that if we are able to go off for them to accommodate people inside to eat. I will not feel so bad. But as a restaurant, you should know people paid for everything including drinks and yet you keep everything to chase us off? Your call if you want to eat there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOXFHbjJnRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,"Had their afternoon tea set ($10.80++), comprising of a bowl of la mian, a dian xin and a glass of milk tea. La mian was good, dian xin were horrible except for the chilli-oil dumplings. Milk tea ok.

I miss the quality of their high-tea a-la-carte buffet during pre-covid days. It was certainly worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OGJHdmp3RRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,"Used to be great. Now after the menu changed, food is cooked differently too. Usual nice food replaced with questionable combinations of food, options are too limited. Signature homemade barley was also removed. Overall, dropped from the expected 5 star experience from Crystal Jade to 3.

With high prices and a reputation to uphold, I expected way better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZ19xQ2J3EAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,2,"The standard has dropped drastically. The 葱油饼 is literally like prata with a tiny count of spring onions. Where is the supposedly copious amount of 葱？Next, the fried rice was bland, not much of wok hei. Last feedback was that the 流沙包 was steaming hot outside but cold on the inside. Granted that they got it changed eventually but the deed was already done. I love Crystal Jade but this time was very disappointed. Hope they improve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc3FiTnNBRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"It was unpleasent . Staff don’t know about their promotion and insist they are right .

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRci1uVGNnEAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,"Service was average, did not clear the empty plates while they serve new dishes and when crew sees glass empty they did not take initiative to ask and refill. Need to prompt them, then they will clear for us and refill. The Yu-Sheng presentation was one of the worse. Totally no green as u see from the photo. Taste was okay though. Dim sum did not match the price, nothing unique about it."

I giving 5 stars to their service! I wanted to ordered some food for sharing but we couldn't cross table for sure. And I definitely couldn't finished all the food on my own so the staff initiate to divide the food into 2 serving for us when overheard our conversation. Really appreciated their service especially during this period of time!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndnVDVnBRRRAB,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,3,Chilli beef noodle was so-so. Same for the multi coloured XLBs.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbkttNVBREAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,2,"Been a loyal customer to this restaurant for a very long time but today’s incident really question whether I would patronised the place ever again.

Was told before ordering that there was a 15% discount promotion if we sign up as member so we happily order more than usual. After ordering we were told to we can only sign up via their apps. Despite trying many many times, the app cannot register our membership. The staff told us the discount cannot be given unless we registered as member through their apps. So after so much trouble and repeated attempts, it was still unsuccessful as the apps OTP doesn’t work.  If u go to apps store page,  u can see a lot of bad comments on their apps.

In the end, we were forced to pay full price without the promised discount. Not sure it was a scam but I definitely feel cheated. It is their apps that doesn’t work, they didn’t honour their offer and we were forced to pay full price for more dishes that we normally order in anticipation of their offer. Maybe I will consider coming back when the moon turn green one day. Utterly a very disappointing experience. Thumbs down 👎👎👎"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdWVTMVl3EAE,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4,"Lovely food. The pan-fried pork buns and fried thick noodles with cabbage and mushrooms are my favourites. Place is clean, comfortable and the service is very good too. It's also less crowded because it's not in a shopping mall. Recommended."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejh5LTdRRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Stumbled upon this non air-con Teochew restaurant. I like Teochew cuisine so why not. Ordered 3 simple dishes for lunch and they turned out good.
The standard of its Teochew braised duck, 潮州卤水鸭, is good enough to convince me to return again to try the other traditional Teochew dishes this restaurant has to offer.
It is reasonably priced too.
Only thing is.... No air-con 😅"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbnFuSld3EAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Walked past this restaurant few weeks ago and saw many people enjoying their steam boat with “imperial design” steamboats. Finally booked the restaurant for the family dinner. We enjoyed the steamboat… super fresh fish and soup was flavorful and not salty.

I love the braised duck… meat was super soft and simply delicious.

Making a reservation was a bit of a mess… they used WhatsApp but when we arrived, they didn’t capture the reservation. So call the restaurant to be sure. Try to get a seat at the extension area of the restaurant where it is much cooler."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNDYzX0lnEAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Service was fine. We over ordered until need to dabao. Lol. Should have opted for small size instead of medium steamboat, esp there are other dishes in the order 😅. The 20% discount for members only on the fish steamboat. I will revisit for the steamboat, chef popiah( surprisingly good and only on certain days) and yam paste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNk5haDNnRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,1,"If only there's minus star* The rice dumplings are simply terrible. They have no respect for food at all and their profession.
Bought 5 of those dumplings home, was told that it can be eaten straight or just simply heat it up by the staff. Went home that evening, opened one, the meat was disappointing, very tough and dry, I think it was less than 1 quarter of the whole dumpling..
the rice is not cook thoroughly and tasteless... sad evening...

How worst it get?
Well, the next morning, we open the rest of the 4 dumpling, it was all the same... no, worst, 1 even spoilt just 1 overnight, that kind of set me thinking, how long have those  $#!+ been sitting there... sad morning..
It cost $4/pc, totally not worth.

Called in to complaint, asked for management, the staff simply say: ""I don't know, I don't know"" part of their training? 🤔

Conclusion:
Terrible food, terrible people, terrible business..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMF9lLVl3EAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"$188 set dinner. The dishes that stood out for me is the imperial pot with fish maw. Full of flavour and ingredients, and the yam paste dessert with white nuts was good too. The duck was ok. They ran out of Garoupa, offered prawns instead. The crab seemed very small but tastes good. Wet wipes are chargeable. The day that we were there, there was only 1 staff serving. We had to help ourselves to the various sauces and serving spoons. The air-condition was not turned on until requested. Ala carte may be better? The dining experience seemed abit stressed being under staffed and humid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM0l2akhnEAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Got to try this restaurant for the very first time about 9 years ago when they were still located at Rivervally. Their fish porridge and braised duck are quite popular amongst the regulars.

Duck : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (can be softer)
Porridge : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Salted Egg Toufu : Better to remove from menu
Pumpkin Yam Paste (Or Ni) : ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (blend well before eating)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHRhUkFnEAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Came on the recommendation of friends. The place is actually made up of a Teochew restaurant, a dim sum stall, and a drink stall. Private rooms and airconditioned sections are available. The charcoal fish-head steamboat came out with a battered pot and sooted chimney, signs of frequent usage (popular dish). The soup was creamy and salty which suits my palate (unlike other brands that tend to be slightly sweet), and the base used in the soup was fried fish. I could taste yam, prominent salted plum, and butter. Belachan chilli was not spicy despite the mean look. The other unusual stuff that came with it was the shredded fried egg. The raw fish slices provided were fresh. We also tried charsiew bao and liu sha bao and were not impressed."

Overall this was a very good experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MGFHSzFRRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,1,"The waitress who looks like a senior staff doesn’t even know peppercorn vs black pepper. I am well versed in both English and Chinese so the menu clearly is understood by me. Plus I love to enjoy food.  But not here. Sure, she is rude but I waited to see if the food is any good.   That glutinous rice rolls are horribly salty, the rice is not even cooked at a good temperature and everything is just mashed up and salty.  Doesn’t even have the fresh taste.  The so called chicken dish is so normal. The rice is really not cooked well(a restaurant with messed up rice….), they mess up the order, comes over to do a so called I am sorry the kitchen made a mistake.  So the kitchen can’t even understand orders?  Anyway, is there a minus star?  Google team, we really need some attention here, so many people with bad taste buds or fake reviews are being paid for it?  I am strongly against bad food.  Bad service. For the price doesn’t even do any justice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNXNQOV9nRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Environment is okay, next to market.
Dim sum not freshly made, taste is average.

Porridge taste good, prices are reasonable.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhc3ZiVm1RRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,3,"Having walked pass the shop for so long, finally a visit. Very busy this particular evening. Extensive menu with not so many Teochew dishes. Food was ordinary tasting by me. Duck's braising liquid could do with stronger flavors. Kway teow lacked wok hei. Orr jiang was overly starchy for my liking. Sugar coated yam was fantastic! Just as I remembered when granny had made these many moons ago. Siew Mai filled with prawns instead of pork or fish paste was a wonderful delight, like ones you will find in a proper cantonese restaurant. Being very reasonably priced dining here makes it up. So it's a mix bag of hits and misses in here. Shall look forward to try the rest of their menu offerings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNWVIbWpnRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,5,"Yes, very yummy fish steamboat, cold crabs and Teochew braised duck with beancurd.
We will there on 24 Feb to celebrate my birthday."

We had:

1. Steam carrot cake

5. Seafood Roll

Dim sum no GST but ala carte has.

Total damage is about $35."

The soup is milky and rich and full of ingredients. Theres fried fish in it and also a plate of raw fish slices, tons of veg and fried egg in it. Love the braised duck and my dad loves the pork jelly. Theres another branch at bukit batok which I frequent as well but tt outlet doesnt have steamboat option. Overall great place and portion is very generous too! 😍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycWZTU0lnEAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,3,"Steamboat is definitely good, broth is flavourful and tasty but can get too salty towards the end..Oyster omelette is also strongly recommended but the rest of dishes such as dim sum, sweet & sour pork, fried tofu, the mixed platter wouldn't be missed. Braised items are also below average.

In conclusion, there are only 2 star items on the items.

Service is slow and expect nothing more. Dishes are also not served in sequence.

If you are not going for steamboat, then don't bother."

There was supposed to be a 10% membership discount. My sis asked if the discount has been applied and the cashier said Yes. Thankfully, my sister was alert enough and asked to see the original receipt (before discount). The cashier looked uncomfortable and presented the correct receipt.

Not sure how many times unknowing customers have been scammed.

Food is decent but please check your receipt before paying."

Asked the other junior staff and they just ignore and indicated it was not their responsibility.

The owner should relook at how they allocate staff appropriately.

After dinner, I have to queue to pay and that takes another 20min in the queue.

I will never come back. Period."

You can order dim sum or from a la carte or set meal."

No regrets. Fish head steamboat is a cut above all the other steamboats i’ve ever had. $65 for a small one. It was enough to go around for my mum, wifey and me. Generous Fresh tasty fish slices and they constantly refill the super savoury soup! i signed up for the member and got a instant 20% disc on the steamboat. We also had yam paste for dessert (pumpkin and ginkgo options available) Service was excellent, generous refill of soups, tea. was there on a weekday evening and was not crowded.

at first i thought it's only 1 piece maybe they put a bit of meat only, turns out all 3 pieces inside meat like this photo.

see photo yourself, $3.80 each, a few meagre pieces of dry hard meat. taste bad also, don't think will even try the restaurant. please warn others.

honestly, i have never been so angry, and tasted something so bad. i have had better one that only cost $2.50 each with more meat inside.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdTdYV1F3EAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"Really like the batang fish porridge as the soup is thick and tasty, alot of fish. $12 for 2 person and should be enough for 3 person. Tim sum is handmade, 20% discount after 10pm. No gst or service charge and is open 24hrs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNFktNHp3RRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,4,"On the contrary to most reviewers, attendants were attentive BUT VERY CONFUSED.. That was mostly about the orders and availability of dishes, the rest of the dinner was well enjoyed..
Food was delicious and the fish steamboat we came for was delectable (I would hope so, given the price). Not to forget, they are opened 24 hours, I can come at any hour when I miss the soup.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4XzVmU1pREAE,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,5,The fish porridge is superb! Very flavorful! Gonna try for new goers! Their seafood porridge too! Ordered 2 porridge and good for 3 pax sharing! Will go back again!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcVpuTDhRRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,3,"Had their $13.80nett dim sum buffet but alot of items were already unavailable or left one or two in stock upon arrival, what we ordered here are mostly what they left with on a Sunday mid afternoon.

Pan fried turnip cake, fried prawn dumplings, siew mai, ju chong fun are the better tasting items off whatever they are left.

My first visit here, not sure when they have most items but this place runs 24hrs, dim sum are all handmade, probably explains the lack of variety."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbXVqSl9nRRAB,Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine,5,"Very tasty steamboat, piping hot and rich. Staff keep filling soup. Fish is gd quality.

Jan 21 - 2nd visit. teochew fish porridge is excellent. $6 1 pot. See picture below. die die must try

April 4 - 3rd visit. Fish porridge standard maintained. The 韮菜饺 skin very thin, prawn very fresh"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbnVPZ2xRRRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,"Held my wedding dinner at Jubilee Garden Restaurant. Torrence and Banquet Manager Kent were very prompt in their replies. They guided us through the procession and the program, constantly assuring us that things will turn out well. They were also very helpful, polite and generous.

The food was delicious and value for money. Portions were big and our guests loved the food.  Thank you so much for making our wedding dinner such a special one. Greatly appreciated.

(Photos featured were taken during our food tasting session.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOGFxODd3RRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Visited Jubilee Garden several times with the family.

Food's consistently good (not mind-blowingly good, at least at that price point, but you should have a comfortable and enjoyable time). The premium items are are only one serving per table (understandably so but still a bit of a bummer, especially with the chilli crab. The 4 of us had to ration and felt wanting a bit more).

I must add though that service was fantastic - all the service staff were polite and attentive without being intrusive -  kudos to the experienced and well trained staff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeHNPa1ZBEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,"Definitely worth trying this ala-carte buffet Chinese restaurant and eating here again!  Good service from the staff - keep it up!  Since the food from the restaurant was surprisingly tasty, the cuisine must be pretty promising for wedding banquets.  For those who loves zhi char, the food at this restaurant is a must-try!  Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcXRqNHJnRRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,I found the information regarding what they actually offer lacking online so I talked to a friendly male staff about it. They mainly do buffet and wedding packages but they also actually offer ala carte menu as well. This review is more for posting their ala carte menu photos for the benefit of everyone. I will go back for the food someday.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcXBxZHJnRRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,Price is okay. Food taste i find it average overall. It was quite empty inside the restaurant during weekday evening time....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc2RfbGV3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,2,"Good place for quantity only. Food quality is poor, you get what you pay for. Service attitude needs to be improved, staff were annoyed when they can’t fit the dishes on the small tables and they started stacking plates, expecting us to balance it. They also ‘reminded’ us about waste charge when we couldn’t bring ourselves to eat unpalatable fish with soil taste - we left behind  bones and some meat. Perhaps they expected us to finish the bones too. Will not revisit"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MmNLR1ZREAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,Came here with company for CNY lunch. Buffet style. Not bad. Their service is good. Food tastes not bad. Price is affordable too. Will be back again another time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NHJYdk9REAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,We had the ala-carte lunch buffet on 24 July. Quite good value with the birthday promo. Food is generally above average. The crabs and prawns are fresh. But the steam cod fish is not fresh as it has a weird smell and the clams have too much sand. Service is excellent especially the waitress called Ah Qing who is very attentive and can anticipate our needs. Food is served quite fast and hot. We will be back and hope they have new dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNTRDWkt3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,"It was a great dinner evening today at TPY Safra and most of all they were so kind to call back my friend who make the reservation , to inform her that I have left my purse there after my dinner .
Ps. Thank you to Mr Wu 🙏🏻to wait for me at the Safra lobby to hand me back the purse. Much appreciated with your kind gesture. 🙏🏻
Pros:
Very clean place  - Spacious , great for wedding dinner , no cuts of plates and bowl and they were all squeaky clean! 👍🏻
Affordable buffet price with great taste !! Good quality amount of food for 2 person ✌🏻
Friendly reception & attentive service staff :)
Cons:
No credit card promotion . Only Safra member 10% discount"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnZ2clNBEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,2,"The food seems like all precooked. Was Served right after you order. Chilli crab was the worse we've eaten, tasteless and full of starch. Pig's trotter vinegar, the meat were all dried up and there was a piece full of hair, really spoil appetite. Deep fried tilapia was OK except that for 9pax, they gave a very small fish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dWNiaUpnEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,Good food and service. Too full!!! We enjoyed the food alot and will be back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbzhLNFB3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!😰😱

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcDZlMUpnEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,The lotus wrapped rice could be more fragrant and the yam paste can be more thicken. Their chicken and abalone dish can be a plus point for events.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzenZQdENREAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"we have company dinner here,
i tried a lot of new food here.
the staffs were so kind."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMUx2SW93RRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Not the best of location for wedding lunch/ dinner. The tables are packed together and staff kept asking guests to shift their chairs so they could squeeze through to serve food and top up drinks. Table planning/ positions could have been done better.

Utensils are sub standard. Almost spilled the soup due to the chipped/ broken bowl.

Food wise, it could be better. Glad that there is a  McDonald's on the ground floor."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aV9hM1RREAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,Quality of food was pretty good for ala carte buffet dinner. Good customer service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb2ZMcU9nEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,2,"Called to make booking and was told will be given birthday boy/girl for free if we meet the number if pax. Upon arrived, can’t find my booking record, and charges are also different as communicated over the phone. Suggest to take down the person name if you make phone reservations. The china lady who handle us at counter and payment was not friendly honestly. The food & service acceptable except the admin part."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtczkyb053EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,1,"It kinda ruined our marriage, even after 4 years later my husband and I still argued due to this. Couples please reconsider if you want to hold your once in a lifetime wedding in this restaurant. Here is the post 4 years ago

I host my wedding banquet on 08 Dec 18 at qianxi TPY and it was a disaster. My name was wrongly printed in the dinner menu. I didn't know dinner menu were supposed to print our name in full and no one advised.
The display TV outside is showing my wrong name as well! my guests did not know is my wedding! This is basic knowledge but yet overlooked by your management. I have emailed to your management and was simply ignored. I guess this feedback will be as well ignored!

A year later we went back to complete our meal in the same restaurant, the waitress accidentally spilled hot water onto my feet. No it wasn’t busy as we are the only table being served by one waitress at that point in time.

If anyone wish to host their wedding there think twice! new brides beware ! If you considering the same restaurant it might ruin your once in a lifetime wedding!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJei1DMUZ3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Situated at level 3 of Safra Toa Payoh, this place consists of at least 3 ballrooms which are customized for different events as listed on their website. I was there for a wedding, and there was also a D&D happening. Food was mostly good while service can be improved. Note that my experience is that of during a wedding."

Nice food, good ambience and friendly staff. Recommended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aElpSjF3RRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Went for the ala carte buffet for CNY. Surprisingly, this style is not bad. Not all dishes are good tho but for the price it is. The jelly fish cold dish is my favorite. Char siew and the garlic slice pork are good. The chilli crab is surprisingly good. Meat are fresh n firm. The abalone soup is not bad. Not too salty. Overall value for price is there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdzhpb0t3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Our senior ladies' choir was invited to perform song item and join the Christmas dinner. The restaurant packed about four hundred guests. The food dishes were served promptly. Dishes well presented, adhered to menu of choice by Host. Service good, ambience decor pleasant. Stage and sound system set up available, as the venue  facilitate karaoke, a key attraction."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVZ2FUa0dnEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,The food was fair. The cold dish was good but no 'WOW' factor. The egg prawn was good but the noodle dish somewhat bland. The duck was well done but the fried chicken was quite dry IMHO. If you are planning a corporate function...it would be ideal but for a special dinner function such as wedding orba milestone birthday celebration...might want to give this  a MISS.

Portion of one time dishes quite small for our big group of 7, not worth it when u come as a big group because the food portion same as another table of 3 or 4."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMkxEUGV3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,"Ordered a voucher on fave for a 7 course meal that included cold starter, shark's fin soup, cod, prawns, abalone, Ee Fu  noodles and mango pomelo sago dessert. The dishes were distinctively tasty, with the cod being very generous as well as the sharks fin. Prawns were well cooked in a unique sauce that we all enjoyed. We definitely hope to be back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZN1AtclFREAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,1,"The service is the worst I have ever experienced, no exaggeration. The servers here act like they’re not in the service line.

1) They lied to us that there’s no wine served when we clearly saw a few tables with glasses of wine. Only when we pointed it out then they served it to us.

2) They complained numerous times to our face when we nicely asked to have our plates changed or tea refilled, which I think is quite a standard for Chinese banquet.

3) When we called for one server, she just gruffly signaled for us to ask another server and walked off.

Not worth it to hold your event here even if it’s cheap, as the service ruins it for everyone. I really wonder if the people who are giving 4 or 5 stars are their own people trying to increase their rating."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOGZEdXNBRRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,Our favorite buttet lunch
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd01UUExnEAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,1,Rubbish service. Forgot about our order and then made it the customer’s fault
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NmRTMmFREAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Budget type of ala carte buffet... Where you get to order as much as you want for those dishes that you always never had enough of during wedding banquets. Haha.
Prawns, chicken, whole fish etc..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeWJERU93EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,"If you are looking for a chinese restaurant that is  very reasonable in price, great food and good location then do consider this restaurant. The waiters and waitresses tend to be elderly but they are very friendly. If there are special functions going on, parking may be challenging. However, there is always the valet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ck5mNVZ3EAE,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,5,Wonderful ambience for a small gathering.  Good food served at Jubilee Garden Restaurant.  Very friendly environment plus cheerful staff to enhance our meal at this location.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJemRfeXNBRRAB,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Good environment for company event.
They provided big LCD screens for the event and provided tech support throughout the event.
The services provided are above the expectations.
However, the food quality is inconsistent and can be further improved upon."

Wanted to try a nearby Thai cuisine but it was not opened yet.

We then settled for this zichar stall at another coffee shop.  The white beehoon (白米粉@S$5.50) and san lou hefen (三捞河粉@S$5.50) were not too bad, better than expected.  The serving of white beehoon was quite big.

You may want to give it a try if you are around here, and run out of idea on what to eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMkk2Sl9RRRAB,Zhenwei ZiChar,4,Very tasty San Lao Hor Fun and beautifully fried plate of fibre and crispy hae bee.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dE5mV2VnEAE,Zhenwei ZiChar,5,Have been a regular at the stall especially enjoyed their claypot tofu which comes with lots of gravy. First time ordered delivery as my whole family down with Covid-19 and they willing agree to deliver despite knowing our conditions. Thanks so much!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MlBQMTdnRRAB,Zhenwei ZiChar,5,"They served authentic Chinese home cook Zi Char with down to earth pricing. Previously from Toa Payoh West CC, they are now at Blk 126 Toa Payoh Lor. 1

Don’t miss out their savory golden Tofu, aromatic spices curry fish head and their new dish garlic pork!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc3ZpMTFnRRAB,Zhenwei ZiChar,1,"Am a regular client of this stall. Even that I am not spared but to suffer very bad service and rude attitude from the lady taking orders today. We ordered our simple dine in meal together with take away. It was about 6pm. Not busy hour yet. The dine in food came really fast. After we finished, the take away was not ready. I was surprised. No choice but wait. End up, I was made to wait another 15 to 20 minutes for the take away. Not only that, one of the orders was wrong. 新洲米粉 became 新洲河粉. May be I mountain tortoise, never know 新洲河粉 ever existed. In a not so polite manner, she said she will change for me. But I am not prepared to wait another 15 mintues to change the order. And she argued and lied with a straight face saying my wife told her to start preparing the take away only after we finished our meals. Wonder who in the right mind would do that in a coffee shop Zichar stall with smoking corner just a few steps away. Without my wife to verify on the spot as she already left to run some errands, I had to take the lady's word, and left, not so happy of course. Obviously my wife did not tell her that.
Everyone makes mistakes. Just admit with the correct attitude. No big deal. Why tell lies to cover a mistake? Moreover, to a regular client."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE1yMzd3RRAB,Zhenwei ZiChar,2,"Portion is very small for large.  Was charged $40 for 2 portions of large noodles and $20 for 2 miserable pieces of toufu with a few minced pork at the top. Total $60.  Really a ripped off coz the large portion is like medium.

Update: Ate at another zichar store today and spent $86 for 5 medium dishes and rice. Medium portion was like zhenwei's large. There was even leftover coz we were so full after the meal. Really value for money unlike this zhenwei. Will not patronise Zhenwei again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Mk1ldm9nRRAB,Zhenwei ZiChar,5,"One of the best zi char stall around in Singapore and most importantly the price is very reasonable, was surprised of the total bill after ordering so much. Will definitely visit again.👍👍👍"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM04zZjFRRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Friendly and attentive staff. Nice cosy environment. Food is good and delicious. We especially love the assam curry fish head, quite spicy yet taste good. Do try their dessert as well. Overall worth coming again for dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3NXMElnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Located just 5mins+ walk from Potong Pasir MRT, Gu Ma Jia serves a decent varieties of local 煮炒 that are simple yet delicious.

The Assam Groupa Fish Head was quite spicy and goes very well with rice. Kyoto pork ribs were very tender with appetising sweet and sour sauce. Salted egg prawns were very fresh but otherwise pretty normal. What surprise me was the ying yang kai lan which was served with deep fried shredded kai lan leaves and crunchy kai lan stems.

Staff were very prompt in service and  friendly as well. Recommended to make reservations during Friday night and weekend to avoid not being able to get seats. Pricing were reasonable as well.

Overall definitely one of the better zi char restaurants option in Singapore.

There are plenty of dessert cafe and bar next to it for after meal chilling sessions as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOGJfdllnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Don't let it's humble shopfront fool you. The food is nothing less than legendary. My elder brother stays nearby for years and I have passed this store countless times. Strangely on the eve of his relocation, he suggested to dine here and he has never been here before. It was a last minute reservation (made 30mins before we arrive) and it looks a little empty for a saturday night.

Honestly I didnt harbour much expectations and ordered mainly the signature items which are less likely to go wrong. The dishes were promptly served and oh boy.. i was so wrong. The chicken soup is flavourful and though most of us didnt like chinese parsley and there was abundance in it, we slurped our bowls empty in no time (skipping the parsley of course) and found ourselves wanting more! The assam fish we've had before were mostly a tad too sour and this was amazingly balanced, the fish was cooked just right. Despite swearing to go on a diet, i had to have half a portion of rice to go with the sauce or I will sleep with regrets.

The final dish that came which sealed the deal was the signature prawn noodle. Gu ma jia is located just steps away from a famous prawn noodle available in single portions at a starting price of $5 while for this, the only size comes in a huge claypot at $30 but I will gladly choose this in a heartbeat. The broth is rich and yummy of course but what's shocking is there is wokhey. Show of hands, who had prawn noodles that had wokhey?

The other dishes that I didnt mention does not mean it wasnt crazy good. I just didnt wanna give any more spoilers. Go explore places that may not seem instaworthy, for a change, and they might surprise you with a dinner that you will remember for life."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcVAyVktBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Gu Ma Jia kitchen is simple and unpretentious. What you see is what you get

Sometime simplicity is all you need. Don’t need the pompous and filtered photos which looks good but end results is disappointing.

It was a celebration for a colleague returning for a short stint at Korea.

There were 5 of us hence five dishes.

Service and waiting time were generally ok. As this was a treat by the boss, I didn’t know the actual price. However I have glance at the menu and the prices are reasonable.

Certain dish only come in standard size whilst other have different sizes. Make sure you check when ordering. You can ask them to help you estimate the dish size based on your group size.

My favourite dish was the Asam fish filet. They packed a punch in terms of sour and spiciness. On that day they ran out of the whole fish hence the filet.

If you crave for home taste cooked food, I would recommend this kitchen."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOHFxVld3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Awesome place to enjoy a family Chinese dinner with strong flavours and all dishes are tasty. Worthy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdU9tWFh3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,"Simple yummy home cooked Chinese food done well near Potong Pasir. The place has been around for more than ten years. And one of the best thing, you allow BYOB for wines for $10 corkage. We are definitely coming back here to try other dishes!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdUotTVp3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Love the food. Taste like home cooking which is always excellent. Very personable service too by friendly staff. Malaysian chefs and staff. I think I remember a famous food blogger says if all the Malaysian chefs go home, our zhi cha stalls will suffer. I believe so.
We had the claypot tofu which was full of roast pork and melt-in-the-mouth tofu and 3 cups chicken with a sauce that tastes like satay marinade. A tad too sweet for me. The hot Pulot Hitam dessert comes with a scoop of really frozen vanilla ice cream. Hubby really loves the combi. Will return again with other family members and friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMXVMUnJRRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,3,"My parents tried once on their ala carte dishes and it was not too bad. But this second time we ordered the set meal, which was unfortunately not to my liking at all. Have to say the curry fish head is not too bad, normal. But the rest of the dish... is really not my kind of food. Average or slightly below average. Will not return again. I noticed many people are waiting to be seated, probably the taste suits old people more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeV9pazRnRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,3,"Zichar style food at zichar pricing with aircond. Very fast service, pleasant servers. Able to call in advance to make reservations.

Food quality wise (perhaps it’s the dishes that I ordered), I don’t think it’s exceptional. Some dishes were tad too salty, some lack the final
Oomph.

Perhaps I’ll come back to try the curry fish head that everyone is raving about."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaXJpdkVBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,Zichar place with aircon and a heart in what they serve. The claypot tofu is one of the best we ever tasted. Nothing to complain. Little boy loves the roasted pork inside while his daddy likes this kind of toufu very much (someone should put this as an official guideline for all Zichar places: only this kind of toufu should be used for claypot). The shrimp paste chicken has crispier skin. We tried the signature Kyoto rib in yam ring (because don’t have the vegan Assam fish that day 😭😭). Rib is tender but a bit “porky”. Prob won’t try again for that price.  Would like to recommend the hot honey lemon. Much better than expected. 😋😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbVlUOFh3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"The food is delicious and nice, reasonable price. You Should try their assam fish head. really nice! however the place is not near any mrt, the fastest way is to take a grab or take bus no. 23 from Boon keng Mrt and alight before expressway if you are not driving."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpc3F5TVN3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"It’s my first visit here and I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. We were seated on level 2 which was empty.

Please order the Gu Ma pork ribs! They are so delicious!!

Do make a reservation as they are famous and get really crowded."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXBmNWFnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Enjoyed our dinner at Gu Ma Jia. Home cooked vibe, attentive service, friendly vegetarian options. Highlight was the yuanyang vegetable, will be back to try the Assam Fish curry!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLTZUakxnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,Looking for a fish head curry takeout and tried it out here. Wasn’t disappointed. Both taste and price  ($30) were on point. The Assam had a real kick and fed 3 for dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLc2RLZjRBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Great food and service. Has a very reasonably priced set meal of all their specialties. Assam fish is a must have!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMXFla1ZnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Old school eatery that really delivers on price and quality. The setup is rather utilitarian, but the staff are attentive and welcoming.

The fish head curry is their famous dish which really delivers. The assam curry is tangy and spicy, touched by sweetness from the vegetables and pineapple. The fish head is meaty, unlike many places. All of it comes together to make a well-balanced whole.

On the downside, the famed Kyoto pork is a little dry and flavor doesn't seep all the way through the meat. Makes for a very instagrammable dish though because of it's flaming presentation.

Overall, the food is good and the price point is very reasonable, leaving you with a sense of satisfaction."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1emZYTVl3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,Food was nice. Service is good. But quite pricey for a private dining restaurant which have kopitiam chairs as seats.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwX1pHZEZnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,"We only had a sambal chicken rice bowl and sambal fried tanghoon for lunch. Both were good enough for us to think of coming back with friends to try more dishes, especially the fish head curry. Will update!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OWJYcFZBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Had family gathering for dinner. Love their Assam fish head and other dishes. Yummy and delicious. 😋😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdnZqamdnRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Never had a bad dish here. Clam bee hoon has the wok taste, fluffy Oyster omlette, tasty spinach soup. Just disappointed they ran out of pork ribs and we didn't know had to order crab day in advance.

Great and attentive service too - I asked for cup of hot water to b sterilise baby's pacifier and waiter even brought tongs for it!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaUx2WjZRRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"The best food!! Very home cooked feel...
Service is tip top first class!!! Must try the Assam fish head and the clay pot wine chicken!!! Fantastic!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bWFpQ3BBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Cosy zi char place! Food is fragrant and tasty. The ubin lala beehoon has good wok hei and the lala is very fresh. They are generous with the egg too. The marmite pork ribs were a little hard but was ok overall. The belacan Kang Kong was delicious, though a little bit on the salty side! Staff were courteous and friendly. Highly recommended place for dinners w bigger groups. You can make reservation here via Chope."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkxlWFlBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Yummy food, fast service.

We ordered Assam fish head, XO prawn noodles, vinegar pig trotters, yam ring with scallops, belachan sweet potato leaves, kai lan. All the dishes were delicious, particularly the yam ring which was crispy and came with fresh vegetables too.

Price slightly on the high side, but worth the splurge."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHIzQktREAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"Homely place with awesome friendly service with much smiles. Lots of dishes to choose from. Because there are only two of us, we ordered ala carte dishes like spicy seafood mee sua and beef teriyaki.

Love their drinks too, especially iced honey lemon tea.

Would definitely want to come back again to try the Zhi char"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdGJ2T1lREAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"service is good, Ubin Lala Bee Hoon very delicious and the price is $18 (take away $19),hot plate bbq sweet and spicy thai style sotong price is $22, claypot 3-cup wine chicken small portion is $15. Overall is good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyektmMEpBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,1,"Food is good but was so disappointed with the service. Its Mother's Day and I understand that they will be busy but when I was ordering and asked about how long it will take, they told me ot will take 20mins. I was willing to wait. But after 30mins, they still tell me sorry, waiting dor one more dish and I was still patiently waiting until its 45mins. I went to the kitchen there and tell them I've waited for 45mins. And they said sorry but do I still want my order, they are really busy. How can 20mins become 45mins? And they came up a few dishes in 20 mins and a few dishes in 45mins? Just very disappointed. No matter how good the food is, service is very important."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdWJPcFBnEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Excellent Zi Char place known for its assam style fish head curry ($30). I had belachan kangkong too and it is very fragrant and well cooked.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhNm9xcGxBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,"Their Asam Fish head is awesome .
Staff is very good and polite.
Worth it to pay a visit ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDV6c09REAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,"A comfortable place to eat.
Air conditioned Zi Char place.

Food generally served pretty fast, price is slightly more expensive than external zi char.

Would recommend if you looking for a comfortable place to eat"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGJYQjlnRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Food was good ordered their signature
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHR2d3pBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,2,I was expecting good food because of the reviews here but the food was really really salty. I wasn't able to finish my Kampong fried rice. Even the lettuce dish is salty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBa1Bpa0l3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,3,Must try will be the sesame oil chicken soup. 2 levels available with good aircon environment.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcHRIbWlRRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,3,"First time there - looks extremely popular at lunch. May need reservations at lunch.  Two of us, their specialty was the curry fish head and a plate of veg, and two hot drinks -$50.  Seems a tad expensive for half a head which was a little small to me.  Forgot to take the pics of the food.

Will try to bring my larger family here and give it a go- seems to have a variety of dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdnVDakh3EAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,食物好吃到......令人流泪。Ordered crab bee hoon. Crab was ultra fresh and super sweet. Shell was cracked perfectly so eating is a breeze. Bee hoon is quality so it remains tangy till the end. Soup taste so good that makes my last day of 2019 so touching.... Please keep up the standard. Will be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbHZTbUJBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,"Gumajia offers delectable dishes suitable for whole family. The highlight should be their assam fish head.

Kids should love their Prawn paste chicken wing and Prawn roll."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzRIdktBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"first time visit. ordered crabs, pork ribs, hotplate tofu and sweet potato veg. overall food is very good. will come again to try their signature assam fish head. Gu Ma is very friendly and recommended other dishes for us to order in the next visit"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3enRxQ1NBEAE,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,Pleasant air-conditioned environment for dining. Food is palatable and lunch deals come with a free drink.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eGFDcWpBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,4,Loved the Assam curry! The second discovery was the kailan 2 ways. The fried kailan leaves were shiok! Overall a very satisfying meal
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHem9TR3RnRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"After dine-in was lifted to 5 pax, my friends and I wanted a cosy and family style eating place.  Location should be convenient with MRT station nearby.
We made our reservation at Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen.  The lady who took our reservation was very friendly and thoughtful.
Our table was reserved at level 2, which was not noisy. It alowed my friends and I to catch up after not meeting one another for 35 years.
Food was great with generous portion.   Price was very reasonable.   Staff was friendly and attentive, even came to ask us how was food.
Overall, ambience, food and staff were great!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTa3JHVWd3RRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,Family style cooking. Love their fried egg plants.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMG83TG5BRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"One of my fav restaurants to go when I crave ""home cooked"" dishes. Good value for money. Friendly service. Pepper crab is awesome. Place is cosy. 2 thumbs up for the crew 👍🏻👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d282cDZBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,2,Disappointed travel from Bukit Batok it just like most ZIchar so outstanding but ok
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMUxQMmhBRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,5,"A dining place you must try if you are near macpherson.All their dishes are delicious and value for money.
👍👍👍👍👍👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdV9tTi1RRRAB,Gu Ma Jia Private Kitchen,2,Ordered their 4-5pax delivery menu. Food came within the delivery window however it was not kept in a warmer bag when it arrived. Food were cold and unpleasant to eat. They could have at least make an effort to keep it in a warmer bag. 2 stars for their delivery. 5 stars for their dine in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bXFHazNBRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,"Was there on a weekday lunch around 12pm+. It was not very crowded. The service was very fast. We ordered food for 6 people and each paid around $16.50. The duck skin is crispy and meat is soft. The char siew has a nice char and nice fat to lean ratio. Overall, it's not bad but a bit salty and has MSG."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbktTWkdnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,The char shao was lean so it is suitable for older folks but it certainly didn't look like what the pics in sign board.  When my duck and Chartham rice  order was taken I was asked if I  wanted to add an egg or anything else so I added bean sprouts but I didn't expect a whole plate of beansprouts to be served so damage was $13.30.Would be better if staff could inform me. Beansprouts were quite crunchy but a little salty for my liking. The place is loud and the staff voices were very loud.  Not my first place to have a nice quiet meal especially when food is jsut avg
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eW9tUTV3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Expensive, bad service and bad food. $5.50 for a packet of soya sauce chicken with mostly bones. What a cheating eatery! I bought this for my child and ended up there was very little edible part. Service was prompt but without smile, bordering on rude. I was a regular many years ago but since the change of boss, it’s bad service and bad food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPei1lRENnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,Meat was sparse and there is no price list displayed throughout entire shop. You will only know the price after you ordered. $6.5 for this plate with no add ons. Nothing special but charge premium. Be warned
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdzVlZmhnRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,"One of my go-to places for wanton noodles. Their Pork lard is amazing! Soup is on the peppery side. Char siew is sweet & to my liking.

Price wise, it's $6 for a bowl of noodles with char siew & veg and also comes with a soup containing 3 small wanton."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc0lMZndRRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,Nice place for roast duck and char siew(recommendation is to order the streaky version aka 半肥叉烧). Comes with a side bowl of thick & flavourful umami gravy to drizzle on white rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMjd5WThBRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,"Qtr roast duck=$17. Mixed char Siew & roast
Meat=$16. One braised egg=$1. Noodle kosong=$2. White or chicken rice=$1 each. Total damage= $38 for 3 paxes. Price on the high side but the quality of their char Siew and roast duck is good & above average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPalk2dlFBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,Would recommend the char siew wonton noodles from this shop! The dumplings are also well filled.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLajZtZ2NBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,"Rice used not very good quality, when you have char siew sauce it doesn't taste good. The noodles were better.

Shrimp dumpling is huge, $1 each. Although lots of meat with a small whole shrimp in it, I would describe it as very rough execution, which is a menu item you can skip.

With noodle and rice charged at $5.50, which is good court pricing, I would not say it was value for money. Food good enough to satisfy your hunger or crave for roast meat, but not a place to visit due to quality/value of meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydTctN1JREAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,I have to say it’s priced on the high side for a central hub hdb area. But the noodle was just very well done with just the right amount of seasoning and the roast duck leg was excellent.  I’ve paid much much more for worst food at Holland village. I read many comments about price verus quantity.  I rather eat high quality then quantity.  It doesn’t get 5 stars because $9 for my noodle priced out a lot of older uncles and aunties.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxbXFqc1FREAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,"Knew it was pricey when i went. Still got taken aback when bill came. Haha

Food is good. Roast duck good. Charred char siew is power. Roasted meat is good too.  Noodles are very Q.

Dumpling soup is mediocre.

Don’t know about the service as there was no dine in due to covid. But tar pow was fast and pleasant. Will definitely go back as i did not expect michelin service with the michelin pricing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NDlXRHNnRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Food was good, but on the expensive side. $6.50 for roast meat & char siew rice in a casual (not even food court) setting. 2pax, spent $19.50

Attitude sucks as we were carrying takeaway bread when we enter, and the cashier, shouted no outside food. Seriously, you really think we would buy bread just to eat at your small stall? Prefer to spend my money somewhere"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOE9uTmh3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"They have 2 servers who stood outside the stall to take takeaway orders.  The other small skinny lady was good with order, but the plumper china lady was bad. She took the wrong order the first time, now she shortchange me when she gave me back my change (not sure if she is keeping the coins or she really forgot.  Regardless, she’s a very careless person). If I see she’s the one taking order there, I wouldn’t buy from this stall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdk5HcWd3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,"Wow so much controversies. I like the food. Highlights are the charred char siew and roast meat. The meal pictured was about $38, for 3 pax. Was lucky as the crowd wasn't bad on Sunday 12pm. They served the food very quickly. Will be back again if there isn't any queue. Nice food though slightly ex."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbnNLU01nEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,"Love their soy sauce chicken,  char siu and roast pork. Reminds me of the way they serve it in Ipoh -  Cantonese style. Their condiments of chili and ginger oil sauce are also really good. Like in true Cantonese fashion, some of the staff have the attitudes to match (ok, I am stereotyping) and that's the main reason for the low ratings - but I didn't have a problem each time I was there and the taste is just great!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4OTRhazhnRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,"We got half a duck, a mixed platter of char siew and roast pork and individual bowls of noodles. The food, including the noodles, was pretty salty. Apart from the duck, the rest of the food came in small portions. This is especially so for the noodles, which cost $2 each. The char siew was the saving grace of the meal though. The noodles also came with lots of lard pieces.

Service was also quick."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvOTQzTzdRRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,"I have been eating this place for quite a few years and never had much problems with the staff. Price wise, agree its rather pricy. However, their meat is rather tender and juicy. Especially like the sio bak. You can request for oily rice. The chilly sauce for the chicken is really appetising"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdE1UNlZBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,"Was having training at the nearby hdb hub. Visited this place for lunch. Ordered the simple wanton mee noodles. The char shu was good, but the wantons and the noodles were normal.  They included pork lard in the noodles and that’s why it’s pretty flavorful. Paid $5 for the wanton mee which I thought was slightly on the high side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dXV1VVpnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Overpriced experienced
Roast duck and char Siew for two persons is $16. Just Noodles alone is $2 per plate. While the duck taste good but too overpriced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaHEtN2J3EAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,2,"Paid $5 for a bowl of soya sauce chicken noodle, portion that came was small for the price paid, prob equivalent to $3.50 at other shops. Noodles was alright, done right qq and springy. Sauce is ok, abit saltish but taste better when dilute with soup. Soup quite tasteless, balances out salty sauce. Chicken breast was soft and tender. Slightly dry but tasty

Other reviews say it all. Will not visit again

Value for money 1/5
Taste 3/5"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbnJqYWVBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,"Yummy Chicken, Roasted Pork and Chashao pork. The options to have it with rice , noodle or koay teow is awesome! They have a few kind of steam soup such as watercress, lotus root and salted vegetable duck soap."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZdVkyLVFBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,"Prompt service, decent portions, but server attitude isn't the best here. 3 stars for taste of soy sauce chicken and charsiew, nicely charred and tender chicken"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFa2YzeDV3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Totally...black shop (黑店)。If you notice, there is no pricing at shopfront. They keep upselling too. Take  ginger sauce also, cannot..will not return to dine here. Smallest plate is $4.50， achar dunno is they just add-on to your plate and charge or what. No, thank you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaE9IX2NnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,2,"26/05/18
Slightly above average and pricey Cha Siew and roast pork rice. The dark sauce is nice but the meat portion is too small to fill the stomach. The chilli sauce is nice too. Seriously need to improve their customer service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQweU1hRnVRRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,Always one of our fav places to eat roasted meats and clay pot rice. Servers have always been friendly and chitchat with our lil girl too. Very homely place ！
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNDlmTUJnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"My grandparents purchased Cha Siew from this shop and they changed them $12 for this amount! What's worst is that majority of the pieces are burnt!

Please do not patronize such unscrupulous vendors who take advantage of the elderly. This shop is a real disgrace and having it located in the heartland (Toa Payoh) where many old folks live is even worst.

I did not even what to give a rate but unfortunately, the minimum rating of 1 star is required for the comment to be posted."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eVBhYTN3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,"One of the best char siews I've had, but the portion of meat is rather small for the price ($4 for char siew rice). Comes with a nice small side of achar though. Beansprouts are delicious, with a generous topping of fried onions and pork lard, but expensive at $4. Dumplings were stuffed incredibly full with a whole prawn and a good amount of meat, but were rather pricey at $4 for 4 as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLXZfVUZBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,Ordered takeout for 2 pax and was shocked to see the amount of meat was so little! SGD18 for this is ridiculous. Will definitely not visit them again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTRtVzBBRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,3,Food tasted ok but u only know the price of the food after u r billed. Pricey.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbjdhTjdnRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,2,"Personally feel the food slightly above average but not like fantastic, price on the high side !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMVBIbGxRRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"The duck rice is not nice and is very expensive. $6 per plate just only a few pieces of meat on it.
I go other place eat duck drumsticks is only $5.5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeF9DbkpnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,I just to brought 2 package of rice. 1 is duck and the other one is chicken rice. I ask for the sambal chili the boss keep insist say no . I say I exchange for the sambal she shouted very loud SAY NO. she say that chili only for noddle I keep telling her I exchange she just SAY NO NONO. Omg I will never go back again anymore.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNklxOXVRRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,4,"Wanton Mee. Nice Roast Duck. HK style with Honey Roasted Char Siew. Comparable to Kay Lee Roast.

Lots of takeaways. Try their Chinatown Claypot Chicken... Authentic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbTlUbGJnEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,5,"Ordered the roast pork, char siew and roast duck. The roasted meats were very good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOE9QWUtBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,2,"Decided to go there for dinner since many years haven't tried.
No menu and price list to order from, and specifically told the staff that we wanted small portions of roasted duck, roasted meat and char siew, dumpling soup, 2 plate of rice and one plain noodle.
When they served, it was one quarter duck, and another plate of roasted pork and char siew which seemed to be able to serve 4-5 when there are only 3 of us.
And come with the bill of almost $43 for 3 of us! Probably the most expensive roasted meat that I have ever taken, other than Kam's Roast.
Some of the reviews commented that it is like black shop (黑店) which I would not deny having that feeling too.
On a fair note, the food is not bad but does not justify the exorbitant prices.
There is a lady who seemed to be the lady boss, seated there and busy with her accounts (maybe calculating how much money they have grabbed), and with rather poor attitude.
I would have given one star, but decided to give one more for the old uncle and old auntie for their good service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bnFQN3B3RRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Roasted pork/cha siew rice doesnt come with soup. Beansprout is overly salty and not crunchy enough.  There is something that i cant fathom as well.  My mum asked for dark soya sauce to be placed on the sauce plate but they say they could only pour soya sauce on our plate and not on the sauce plate.  For chilli and light soya sauce,  it is okay to pour into the sauce plate.  When asked the rationale,  they just said it is a rule set by the female boss.  Attitude was slightly rude."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM29QbF9RRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Awful experience! Buy at your own risk. No price menu available. Did not expect a packet of char siew and siew york rice to cost $6! Order 3 packets and add one egg each to 2 packets. Total cost $19.40. I politely ask for the breakdown, the server on my left very fiesty and unhappily provide the breakdown, $6 a packet, egg 0.70 cents each. After she took my order, she had the order written on a piece of paper and clipped with an olden days wood cloth clipper. She threw my paper order into a basket to display her unhappiness. I kept quiet waited for order to be ready and left. Seriously, many places out there serve fantastic roast meat and char siew. The food is overpriced, as it is a simple setup like a coffee shop, and the server attitude is unpleasant and rude. No STAR at all!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaG95WjlBRRAB,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,A China Chinese staff asked my pregnant wife to bring a baby chair and place it by herself. I got speechless about this rubbish service. Food is nothing special but price is too high considering poor service and lack of hygienic. It it interesting that this type of food stall still can survive. I will never come here again for the rest of my life.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvejU2emVBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"The roast meat are nice, but the owner and staff attitudes are horrendous and overly greed driven.

If you dine in, be prepared that before you finish eating, they start to clear your plates to chase you again. They can do that because they already made you paid upfront, whether you finished your food or not, it’s none of their business anymore.

The owner is too egoistic that customers will patronise them no matter how bad their service are.

A lot of up selling when you place order, their pricing is not cheap to begin with.

Recent bad experience was they imposed ( no signage or notice , just simply refused your order if you want to share the portion ) a minimum order ( of one person set ) per person when this is a hawker food stall !

Avoid if you can, there are better food around."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMWFYVlBREAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Da bao 3 packets of char siew rice this evening and was surprised I was charged $16.50! There was no price list.

The portion is normal, packaging is normal using paper wrap, and while it tastes alright, it does not justify that exorbitant price when I can get similar quality elsewhere for abt the half the price.

Over priced, would not recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbnRpNEF3EAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,2,"As mentioned by others a huge problem is a lack of transparency with prices. They just insist on taking your order without being upfront on prices. Same with drinks. Server got the order wrong adding chili to the wrong bowl and rectified it by scooping it out with a spoon and dumping it into another bowl then looking irritated at my surprised expression. Honestly, the noodles are quite decent with a nice texture and the char siew was good with a nice honeyed glaze. Roast pork was too salty. However, this stall will not get anything higher because of the very aggressive staff touting you to eat here and pressurizing you to order without knowing the prices which are fairly exorbitant for what you’re getting. It’s a hawker stall but there are still minimum standards of service."

Food quality is alright, can't fault them on this, we had soup dumplings, been sprout, roast pork for 4 and 1/2 a roast chicken. Didn't go for duck, and char siew ran out. We just order anything that came to mind because our party of 4 is pretty hangry. Pricing wise, yes they didn't have prices listed and the bill came to be slightly higher than your avg hawker or kopitiam roast meat stall but not entirely unreasonable (avg. S$13 per pax including a drink each). Would I come here again? Perhaps, only after I have tried other places along the food alley stretch here..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdy0yX1hBEAE,Hiang Ji Cantonese Roasts,1,"Below average roast meat, poor service, overprice.
- No menu to see the price. Ordered 1 plate of 散拼 18$ (roast duck, roast pork, char siew).
- 1st bite, make me wonder why so many people eating compare to row of  stall beside it? Taste cannot make it, oily fatty and not crispy.
- Rude uncle using the dirty cloth to wipe the chair just before we are sitting down.
Zero star for it."

Happen to be running some errands around Tai Seng and decided to check out this place.  It was already closed to 2pm when I reached. There isn’t any crowd. Dish selection was quite limited as well. Managed to choose 3 dishes, Ayam goreng, stir-fried cabbage and begedil.  I paid SGD$6.50 which includes a can drink.

Food was delicious, Ayam goreng was crispy and it was topped with the crispy bits. Meat was tender as well. Begedil was also quite nice. Pricing wise, quite reasonable for me.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdzZYZ3ZBRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Taste nothing fantastic but can do, meat and chicken well cook. Pricing acceptable and some are cheap. Please don't come at lunch hours, as many offices around very crowded and very hard to find a seat. After 1.45pm or before 12 noon is the best times."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbWVuaGhnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Good nasi padang place. Price reasonable. Crowded lunch hours. If coming in groups more than 4 pax, it is advisable to come after 1pm. Ample parking space within nearby warehouses."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LWZMSlB3EAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,Food was. Love the varieties menu. Would surely come again. Normally crowded during lunches.  Parking may be a but limited unless U park 3 min away. But no regrets abt the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHRibEFREAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Good food! Clean environment! Decent pricing. Nasi padang has extortionate prices at some places but that was not the case here.  Had a super satisfying meal. Will definitely return again!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbDhLWGRnEAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Reasonably priced and tasted good in general.  There are many choice for dishes of fish, chicken, squid, beef and et.  Like many said, avoid lunch hours, the Q can be very long, and you will likely have negative impression on the hospitality.  The sambal offered wasn't spicy to me, but you might think otherwise.

Lastly, will I visit the shop again? if I am visiting the area, probably yes, otherwise don't think I will travel far just to eat here.  :D"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcExpSXlnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,2,"Just normal Malay food, nothing great..excuse me!! This is not padang food ok. If you guys state this as nasi Padang then something is wrong with your taste buds.some dishes lack of spice.
This eatery is just good to fill up your tummy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5c3ZEQnFRRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Very pleasantly surprised to have found this Nasi Padang spot here in this side of the country. It's very very popular, especially during lunch times. Good for small groups; try not to come in large groups expecting there to be seats. The ayam penyet is amazing. The nasi padang can be a little pricey, but that's nasi padang for you. Just point and choose what you want, then pay later. They have a system running. Just make sure you order the Ayam Penyet (smashed fried chicken)!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjam9DT3RBRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"I gave it my first try recently and it was amazing! The beef rendang was cooked to perfection; each bite more tender than the previous. The chicken wings had a really strong flavour to it too which I personally love. The sayur lodeh was good, but I only had 3 pieces of sayur... Was a little taken aback by that. Nonetheless, parking can be a pain in the area so do avoid peak hours. The queue was fast. In and out in less than 5 during peak hour on a weekday, Post-Cb."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOEp1dnZ3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,2,"I have always enjoyed Muslim Delights nasi padang, no doubt about that. Today one of ur servers (tall dark skin moustache guy) gave me attitude when i asked for more gravy as if i owe him a living. As a paying customer, this is not the way to treat your customer, i will appreciate if you can educate this server, thank you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bWJXRUJnEAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Alot of choice to choose for nasi padang. Very long queue during lunch time.

Price wise abut expensive, but worth it as the food is very good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a2FqU2JREAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Shiok nasi padang...

Many dish choices available!

Everyday a special dish (like Briyani) is available."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NTRHNDV3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"So far, I've tried Lontong and Mee Hoon Soto. Both are nice. Sambal tumis not very spicy, which is good. Their epok2 sardine is a must try. Tasty n ample of sardine inside."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHc3JuM0V3EAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Food still good, it's been a while to dine in here.  Today asked for less rice, with tempeh, sayur lemak, and ayam penyet.  And to down with a teh tarik.  All for $4."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcF9QeTl3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,Great tasting nasi Padang. The portions are generally quite sizable and the dishes are absolutely tasty. The rendang was reasonably tender but I felt the Sayur lodeh was a little bit too watery for my taste. Still a good visit and I’ll definitely be back. Parking nearby is horrible unless you ride a bike.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdnNXU1dREAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Nice place for a very early hearty breakfast. Surprised to see they open really early and almost all  dishes are ready. Got there at around 640am and its already abuzz, satisfied with the food quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaXF6eld3EAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,3,Soild and good food but abit pricey depending what you choose. Beef and fish surely $7 plus and above and quene is long during office and no parking place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczRud0V3EAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,3,"The portion given that day was quite generous, beef rendang and stingray were the two making its way to my favorite list."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLak9UUjF3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Always the place to go to for good quality Malay food. My fave dishes are the curry fish, sayor lodeh, curry chicken, fried chicken, achar and everything else ;)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEx5T2xnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,3,1 pkt (1 Veg + 1 chicken) and 1 pkt (1 Veg + 1 chicken + 1 Fish) Total: $14.90. Taste ok but not sure this is considered economical...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcHN6TDl3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"The food is excellent, generous portions and prices are reasonable.

They do catering as well.

The drawback is the lady boss is not patient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeV9ENFBBEAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Best Malay food in this area, a bit pricey but worth it for their fried chicken and squid."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNHZTOG1BRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Nice Malay food. Pretty pack during lunch time. Go earlier.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcElQRHNnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Their mutton briyani was great. The place is not too warm even on a sunny afternoon. Generally a long queue during lunch hour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcU5Qa3JBRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Delicious nasi padang, very affordable, service good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtelBTM3pBRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"One of the best Muslim food I had in Singapore. They are super generous with the portion and with reasonable price. They beef rendang was superb, soft and tender and super flavourful. All other dishes like even ayam penyet was super good and crispy. They marinate it well. I went during off peak, and I guess it is super crowded when is at peak hour. Definitely will go back to eat again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHNPLWxnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"The food is nice Nasi lemak and nasi sambal goreng.
I m from Tampines all the way to  upper Lebar…"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdk9Ibkx3EAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Love the food there. Will always come whenever im nearby.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMmFxU0JREAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"I found this place by chance.  But I m very impressed with the tempeh.   It is fried, crunchy and give your taste bud a ""yummy,  that's is good"".  Tempeh got a caramel taste, just right for the sweetness.  I ate a vegetarian dish that day.  But my 3 other friends took a portion of their mutton dish and said its good too.  Pricing is fair and portion are large.  Sorry I didn't get a photo of our food.  But believe me, if u are in that area, it's worth a try.  Their service is fast and the staff are friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLW9xMTRnRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Their ayam penyet and tempeh goreng is a must try. Lots of variety.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NWZlSWlRRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"Would have given 5 stars but because of the very unfriendly and grumpy lady boss. Having a queue should bring joy rather than frustrations??? Your layout needs to be improved for better customer flow
The food is above average and very affordable.
The staff were surprisingly much more friendly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydFlHRXJ3RRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,Lots of choices to choose from. Queue move fast. Love their beef rendang.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NU5YLUtnEAE,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,4,"It sells nice Muslim food. Down side is very limited of park lots. Do not dine in during lunch time, difficult to get seats especially during Covid-19 endemic. Enjoy the good food!!! Matey!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ejRyazJBRRAB,Muslim Delights Malay Food and Noodles,5,"Good and delicious food.

Lots of choices for nasi padang and kuih but you have to be early if not you will only get the 'remainders' of whats offered.

Parking is a hassle but SWEET spot if you can get it just outside."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDV6Y2x3RRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"I like the intention of this nasi lemak shop, where they make it affordable for anyone to have some good food. For $1, u get e egg and choose between ikan bilis or ikan kuning. For $1.50 u can get both e ikan bilis & ikan kuning. Then there are all the other addons. I loved the way they fried the chicken. Queue was not that long on a weekday late morning. Ladies at the shop are fast and efficient so it is best you have your order ready in your mind. Taste is not that strong as compared to other nasi lemak shops but my 4 star rating is for their nice intention actually."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeWZTeDFRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"Very reasonably priced. Quite a lot of variety such as mee rebus , lontong and mee siam but they get sold out before lunchtime. Very friendly and helpful proprietors. Sometimes they have cockle or kerang sambal which is hard to find . Their sambals are not too spicy and very tasty. Lontong sayur is kept hot unlike other places"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMWRMd3h3RRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"$1 nasi lemak plus $0.50 either a fish or ikan billie; so far the cheapest in Singapore.  Other dishes like lontong, mee rebus, mee siam etc are sold from $2.50.  They’ve nasi padang with a good spread of ingredients to choose from as well.  Delicious and will come back for more !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dHE2VnVnRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"My first visit here. Seems like all the staff at this stall were family members or close relatives... and they were friendly and courteous. This makes for a pleasant experience. +1 for this stall... I will certainly come again. Mi rebus, mi siam & lontong were a little ""sweetish"" for me... prolly meant for those who couldn't take spicy stuff. The $1 nasi lemak ($1.50 if you want both fish + ikan bilis) was good enough; what do you expect for this price at this day & age..? Well done to the stall owner & staff! 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdU1xaTBRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,Very good pack of nasi lemak and epok epok. Only $1 each! They open very early so do come down earlier if you want to avoid the crowd.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NXRXRGtRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,Delicious nasi lemak with many items and also very cheap and worth it👍👍👍👍...just $1 only. One of the cheapest nasi lemak in Singapore 🇸🇬 👌 😀

Nasi lemak is ok, chicken wings seasoning was very good. I added fired fish, tasted great too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTb2U3Snp3RRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"THE PLACE FOR NASI LEMAK WITH THEIR SAMBAL POWER.. NASI SAMBAL GORENG IS ALSO BEST..
Delicious food, affordable price.. Satisfaction guaranteed.. The least packets of nasi lemsk i bought is 6.. So u guys tell me, how can it not be best.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcDgyWXdBRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"Cheapest Nasi Lemak @$1/- a packet that comes with ikan bilis & egg. If you want a light breakfast or for tea time, have it & you'll never regret."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhektLOEtREAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"I bought lontong and mixed rice. I was so happy the lontong is good. So good. The mixed rice which I have beef rendang, cockles and vegetables taste is outstanding. If u are at Toa Payoh in the morning don't miss this shop for breakfast. Worth the money. Outstanding overall experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa05qdkZBEAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,Cheap and nice nasi lemak. Lontong is nice too. Q was long but move fast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTenEzYmdRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"Old school nasi lemak with a kampung homestyle taste that's so hard to find these days. Took me right back to my childhood.

The nasi was lightly fragrant and fluffy, unlike the overly lemak versions you get at most food centres. The simple standard $1 pack with selar kuning, slice of omelette, cucumber and sambal is very good on its own, but there are other dishes from the nasi padang array if you want add ons.

Now curious about their other breakfast standards like mee rebus, mee siam and the soto. Will be back to try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X0pmdG5nRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,Got the 4 dollars set. Value for money. Chicken was a bit disappointing though. Fried and hard. Sambal was good. Rice fragrant and soft.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ1lfaWNBEAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,The nasi lemak was soft and the fried chicken was so sedap...not forgetting the sambal...it was not too spicy as my kids could eat it...highly recommended if you're looking for gd old malay food...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNzVPdHBRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"Rendang is great, but I kind of hope they would give option for addition of juicy cucumbers into rendang set meal to balance out the dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaDZMZUp3EAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,The food are delicious and the price are really low. For example a packet of Nasi lemak only cost $1.00. In the morning store might be pack with workers buying breakfast
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aDhPWG9BRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"Knew the uncle since i was a boy. till today if walk pass his shop pakcik will ask ""have you eaten""? When i was a boy pakcik always gave free food to us. Very kind and generous pakcik. Food price is really cheap $1 nasi lemak and $4 for nasi sambal goreng with chicken and lastly the taste of the food never change since the first time i ate it. Its simply delicious!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeDVlREZREAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"Cheapest good nasi lemak Nasi Lemak (S$1) comes with a slice of fried egg, a side of sambal chilli, and a choice of either selar kuning (deep fried mackerel) or ikan billis (deep fried anchovies). If you want both ikan billis and selar kuning, it’s an additional S$0.50.
Rice is fragrant and sambal chili is balanced.
If you are a big eater, get two packets for $2.  They are sold out normally at 1pm"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLLV9lUDNRRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"Had the mee rebus, mee siam and nasi lemak with ikan bilis, all in all an average meal which was made value for money as the price for the food is cheap. Rare find in Singapore with prices this cheap!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbXF6SGFBEAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,1,"Obviously not interested in customer getting a good meal. Ordered nasi sambal goreng ayam makan and was given a prepacked pack on a plate. Food is cold and soggy. If I can give zero star, would have given it.  Food is tasteless too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDZzhXRG5RRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,3,"$1 nasi lemak. Can you beat that? Although the serving portion is not huge, it can be a full meal for most people. Not comparable to those nasi lemak with otah, fried chicken wings and sambal tempeh, as you get to choose either fried fish or ikan bilis.

Have it as a snack in between meal, the portion is right size that you can squeeze it in between meal time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcy1hb0J3EAE,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,5,"A 5-star for the very affordable food available. They could have charged more but due to their ""give back to community"", their prices are pegged to the community around them - many elderly who are happy to pay for the small amount of sustenance that they rquire for the day on a day to day basis. The simple $1, YES! ONE SG DOLLAR, nasi lemak with ikan bilis not only fills the stomach but also the heart of the community."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcnYzSTNnRRAB,Kedai Makan Muhajirin,4,"Famous for their $1 nasi lemak which is light on the wallet and a great taste of old-school. Likewise for their mee rebus, mee siam & lontong."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bXAzOTFnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,2,"There was a short queue for weekday lunch. Sambal belacan portion was big but tastes watered down, Sayur lodeh was the worst I've had because it's bland and watery. Sambal goreng was unimpressive as it was quite soggy. I was caught off by how much potato was in it which I felt was a cheap way to disguise as bean curd rather than an improvement to the dish. Beef Rendang was ok but we were hoping for more sauce since it's not the soft and moist kind. It's my first time here and heard good reviews about it but my friend said the macik retired already so quality dropped. Don't think I'll be back for nasi padang of this price. $15 for 2 of us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MDh2NnFnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,"Heard many reviews about this nasi Padang stall in blk 128 Toa Payoah lor 1, happened to be nearby and decided to give it a try. There wasnt any queue when i was there. There were only 2 pax infront of me. Selection of dishes was quite limited actually but went ahead to order.

Ordered the rendang, stir fried spinach and a slices of omelette. Bill came up to SGD$7.50. Have to say that it was quite expensive.

Food wise, rendang wasnt too bad. Have to say, portion of the rendang was quite alot. The spinach and omelette was normal. But have to say their lemak chili padi gravy was very different from others."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnA2bmlRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"I have been to this place since as long as I can remember. A native to Toa Payoh, this stall was formerly at the corner of  Block 125 coffeeshop, back in the 80s. Yes I do agree sometime the price can be slightly pricey as to compare to some other stalls calling themselves Nasi Padang when it just a mixed rice stall. Well if you want to eat something good, authentic it's a good price to pay as Che Rose Nasi Padang serves authentic Nasi Padang that is on the same par as those you can find in Padang, Sumatra. Don't just take my words, you have to try it yourself. My personal favorite would be the Squid, Rendang (beef & chicken) also their Gulai Ayam."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdHN6TVN3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"If you've grown up in Toa Payoh, you would have eaten or at least known this Nasi Padang. Hailed from 1968, they had been here since forever and moved around Toa Payoh Lorong 1 a few times. Saying I had grown up with this stall is no kidding, and I probably have their Nasi Padang at least once a week back then. Some friends have always said, Nasi Padang stalls love to overcharge Chinese customers, unlike what an out of touch MP said some years ago, $2.50 gets you Nasi Padang with Drumstick. Some would say because Chinese are rich, we charge you more. Others with a more logical approach, they are selling Halal food. While Chinese can feed on non Halal, we are depriving other Muslims of their food when they sold us their servings. In any case, I leave it to your judgement, I did had experiences when the same Malay guy ordered the exact same thing in front of me, and i did got charged at least $2 more compared to his plate of Nasi Padang at Che Rose. But I don't take it against them. There's only so many pieces of their delicious Fried Chicken and they do get sold out usually mid lunch peak. In any case, I am back here today at 1230pm, all I love are in stock (except drumsticks) and I am game to eat. The short queue in front of me are all Chinese diners. Figures. My order $11. All my favourites since I was a kid. Fried chicken, Beef Rendang, Bergedil, fried egg, mixed cabbage on rice topped with their curry chicken sauce and sambal. Some might think $11 for this is horrendous. I think its fair. I knew their Beef and Chicken are delivered daily. How I knew? Cos I used to know a relative whom delivered their beef fresh daily from Tekka Market. He had since retired but vendors he knew took over. Fresh supplies daily is not cheap in a coffeeshop stall quantity. That's quality food. And for the same quality if you eat the same in a restaurant, trust me you will be paying way more than $11. Tender and flavourful rendang, crispy and juicy fried chicken, freshness you can taste. Their Nasi Padang and sambal is of a very local Malay style. A familiar taste we grow up with. Now the pair of sisters took over from Auntie Rose. Still you can see Auntie Rose seating at the stall with a watchful eye. Quality and flavour totally the same from when I first had them 4 decades ago. I will definitely come back for more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNC1qbzBRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"Many have commented their prices are above the norm, why not they just display their prices openly, so patron is able to know what they are expected to pay instead of getting surprises after they calculated the price. I have noticed having the same dishes on two visits but price are calculated differently... alamak 😢"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNGVHZEVBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"One of very few really good nasi padang stalls in ToaPayoh/Bishan/AMK area. Unfortunately, the beef rendang was not available (cook was on MC or smthng) so I had to settle for the chix rendang. It was tasty, the pachri nenas & sayur lodeh was also good, the sotong dish was good too. I wish they had sambal belacan but they only had sambal blado left (arnd 2pm) 😉. By the time I wanted to take fotos, there was nothing left on my plate 🤣🤣🤣.
side note: I've cooked beef rendang a few times before & the spices my wife prepared made it ohh-so-delicious!... BUT... I was the one who had to c-o-n-t-i-n-u-o-u-s-l-y stir and turn the beef chunks in the wok for THREE WHOLE HOURS! For those who didn't know, this is why beef rendang costs 2-3x more than chix rendang (chix rendang requires about one hour only to stir and turn). 😃"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbzlMS05BEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,Very nice Nasi Padang famous for their beef rendang. The beef Rendang is not bad but I had better elsewhere. Each individual dish was very very well made. In fact this is a stall that you can eat daily without getting bored of the dishes.Very 'home-cooked' feel. Highly recommended. Must try the beef rendang and see if it's as claimed haha.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbTZ1dFBREAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"Truly homely cooked food with the diversity in selection. Never fails to perk up my weekends with the different combination of dishes to try out here.
It has many must try dishes which can only be experienced with multiple visits"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbTVPUDBnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"This is our family must have for big or small occasion for past 40yrs. Birthdays, public holidays, festive season - u name it. If anyone is on annual leave on particular day, ""anyone"" wil volunteer to go pack this for everyone. Sorely missed when out if Sg. This is how good they are. Consistently flavourful. Taste like home, warms our hearts."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOGNMeW5BRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,Didn't have high expectations as I hadn't heard of it before. Ordered as takeaway and the flavours and quality blew me away!   You can tell it's cooked from the heart. One of my top 2 nasi padang.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLemRxX0ZBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,Lovely lovely Nasi Padang in Toa Payoh. Great flavour and Chili. The sotong is really fresh and well cooked!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eTdEV3ZRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"The rendang is exquisite. The rest of the dishes are above average. You won't get the central kitchen type or cook-for-hire type food. All dishes are lovingly cooked by Che' Rose and her family.  However, do expect to pay more than the usual nasi padang stall for similar dishes. Enjoy :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbTkzM2p3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,Truly authentic food served here and simply delicious.. Enjoyed by my mum and myself.. The family is really nice to their customers too. Kudos...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOXEzRnBnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,2,"Visited this store as I saw some newspaper cuttings as well as certs plastered on the front.

ordered the rice, beef rendang and vege at the price of $5.

Verdict: didn't live up to expectations. You'd expect a dense and flavourful rendang but what I got was watery and flat. look at the photos and what I got and you'd see what I mean"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkpEOG9BRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"My favourite lontong place in this world. The gravy is perfectly sweet, spicy, and not too thick. The lontong itself is fragrant, not too soft, not too hard or crumbly. Lontong perfection."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbXBxMExnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,2,"First time trying since I was also nearby. Fan of Nasi Padang. But too expensive @ $6.50 , with only a small drumstick, spinach and a fried egg. Taste, to me, was normal. Some of the staff did not put on face mask or even wear mask properly also."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb05HaUd3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,"1st time here when the queue was short. Usually queue was very long. So, give it a try. $8 for chicken redang, 1 tempai, curry vegetables and 1 fried egg. Rather expensive. Taste wise ok. Cannot eat frequently due to the high price. But may come again for the taste"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdTl2bkVnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,typical malay nasi padang stall. must try the rendang but the price is a bit expensive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMTdTakp3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,1,"FREAKING EXPENSIVE!!! And not worth it at all.
Food standard so so only.
The nasi padang stall at Blk 28 Hoy Fatt and Whampoa market nasi pandang more worth it. Dun waste time on this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVb0xiQTdnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"Che' Rose Nasi Padang has been around for over 40 years.Che Rose Nasi Padang  is renowed for its Padang dishes and best customer service.One of the best stall we can find in Singapore. Its authenticity padang recipe makes many customers comes back again and again.

You won't be dissappointed when you come here to experience what Padang food all about. I don't have to go into details about, but you will find their food up to your  satisfactory.

So if you crave of Nasi Padang come to Che Rose Nasi Padang at Blk 128 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bDl2aGRREAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,Just ate lunch over there not bad chicken randang but I miss something in it hmmm it's ok anyway nice taste
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLN3FxWWhnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,Tried this after reading good reviews. Their chicken curry and beef rendang is good but overall price is a bit steep for coffeeshop setting. The meal for 3 costs me $33.50. 😭
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5M0pmeXRRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"My fave for the past two decades.
Simply one of the best in sg.
Although the price is simply becoming one of the priciest in sg, easily $6+ for 1 meat 2 veg.
It is now a luxury food, not sustainable to eat it even twice a week."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bHNLekp3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,Food was decent. Beef redang was above average in my opinion but pricing is expensive. 1 piece of beef with 2 portions of brinjal came to $7. Not good enough to warrant a repeat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM18zRDRnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,2,"Ordered a chicken drumstick and 2 vegetable items and it cost $7.50. Taste was so so, I've had better for less elsewhere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aTg2NFhREAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,1,"Tried it due to the many newspaper cuttings adorning stall front. 1 bergedil, 1 pineapple vege & 1 beef rendang for $7 is shockingly expensive. Definitely NOT the best rendang I've tried. Not worth coming back for even if passing by."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdGJmYzF3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"Delicious food but pretty pricey.

Beef rendang, ayam goreng rempah and tempeh are great. Their chili is awesome too.

1x meat + 1 tempeh + 1 veg will run you about $6."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDQyY1V3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,Rendang beef is very delicious. The rice is also very fragrant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLV9fcTVnRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,nice foods. i wish they have nasi lemak tho.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVX1BYTUJBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"Truly excellent nasi Padang. The meats and the curries are Super consistent and wonderful. Be sure to try their beef rendang and bergedil. Be sure to say yes when they offer you their chilli on the side!

Only thing that isn’t consistent is the price. I order the same thing at every visit, but hardly ever get charged the same price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOXJqdWJBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,"They claim to have the best rendang. I do not think so.. I have tasted better.
The portion of beef given is also little. If you  have a big appetite then it's gonna be expensive.. 2 meat and 1 veg is $8.

Chick was good though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaDVTWGFBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,Not a bad nasi padang stall. Affordable and yet tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwc0tQYVdnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,2,"I decided to check this place out after reading many good reviews on this place. The only saving grace was the chicken rendang, it was delicious. I ordered a vegetable dish (not sure what its called) that had beansprouts and green beans, it was all good until I found 2 long black hairs in it. It's definitely not mine as my hair is blonde. I also ordered assam sotong which was not cleaned properly and there were many ""splinters"", that wasnt enjoyable. The utensils were also VERY oily and smelled like fish and were poorly washed. Lastly, it was very expensive considering the quality of the food (1 chicken drumstick + assam sotong + vegetables + rice = ~$8). All in all, it was a disappointing experience :("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLczlhakxBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,1,"Poor customer service, they did not wear mask like seriously. I should have taken a photo and send to food safety inspector. Rude staff I said I want lontong then she said I said rice then she argue with me. Seriously lol dont eat there spoiled my morning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbTV1MHh3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,Both the chicken rendang and beef rendang are superb.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwM3BQYWJnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"Expensiveeeee!!!!! But I'm willing to as this nasi padang is a style of its own and more authentic then most so called nasi padang. My all time favourite as well..the fried chicken is awesome always..consistent as well. Alternatively there is other warung like pariaman, warung makan minang, sabar menanti..also there is one underated warung under hdb block cofeeshop nxt to the beach rd army market."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyME1ibTd3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,V nice. Hope they can maintain their standards of yummy good good food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ3VlTjlRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,3,This is family members business different people have their own way of Charging the food price. I have been there many times same items l have but different prices Either the brothers and sisters charging you. Food l consider good. Beef rendang average ok ok
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ejh2MFhBEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"I am not tried their self proclaimed best rendang in Singapore yet. I have tried the lontong twice. Its good. The gravy was yummy.  Just like most lontong you find elsewhere, it was not hot like I would like. If they could blanch the lontong rice, then I think it would make all the difference. Service was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRbGZ1LVVnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"Easy parking space at the back of coffee-shop. Have had better Nasi Padang elsewhere. Rice was clumpy. Vegetable dish, terong (brinjal) sambal balado, was cold. Rendang was good though a tad salty & the kerisik (fried grated coconut) had a bit burnt taste. Taste is subjective thus I urge Google Map users to try this place, at least once! You might like it better than I did. ;-)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcVliS1RREAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,4,"the best Muslim stall in Toa Payoh.  Good Beef Rendang.  But, on the expensive side."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbzlhZzh3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"Their tagline is ""Possibly the best Rendang in Singapore"" and I'm strongly inclined to agree.  I've never had better and it's a real treasure.  Bitter gourd is nice too, but the real star is the Beef Rendang.  Lovers of Texas-style BBQ will rejoice at this Rendang."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMXJIZklnEAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,1,Just order a plate of rice with one chicken and one vegetable cost $6. Most expensive nasi padang rice in toa payoh
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNExybXh3RRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"Since 20 over years till now the Beef Rendang still remains authentic! Every pkt bought sure must add additional Rendang. Sambal Balado is one of the best since I don't like too much Sambal Belacan. Nenek still working and clearing the plates, at this age!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpd2FhNUl3EAE,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,5,"packed my nasi padang for lunch...sufficient in variety ..veg ..seafood and meats...good sambal and great rendang .....a balanced pricing ...
can also eat there ..  a coffee shop setting ...👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aTd6N2tRRRAB,Che' Rose Nasi Padang,1,The Nasi Padang is overprice and the food is not fantastic. It is going to be my first and last time patronising the stall.

A little bit spicy (even without adding the chilli)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnZYM2V3EAE,Uncle Sim,5,"EXCELLENT FOOD, LOVELY OWNERS & EXCELLENT PRICE !

I stumbled upon this coffee shop this morning !

Ordered mee siam for breakfast and packed lontong home for lunch !  Paid $3.50 each !  Excellent price of $7 for 2 meals.  Totally worth it !

The owners did not short-change on their ingredients despite the price.  I did not ask the owners but I believe they made their gravy from ground up and their ingredients are all fresh !  Very favourful and yummy !  No regret !

I will definitely come back and try other food made by owners.  I enjoy and appreciate ethical stall owners like this couple !

Thank you very much !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRN3RDdnp3RRAB,Uncle Sim,4,Uncle Sim moved from Blk 137 Potong Pasir Ave 3. Both the lontong and mee siam are tasty although I like the lontong more.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1N01xa0xREAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,"I had previously patronised this place to try their Penang Fried Kway Teow and it didn't taste authentic.

Just 2 weeks ago, my parents returned and were giving praises on the food - tasty and had the charred aroma coming from wok.

Skeptical but didn't mind trying. Truly the food were great, with portions being decent and can be shared by two(not a big eater). My family of 3 visited on Friday at 630pm which was already fairly crowded but managed to get a table. Come any later, you may need to wait around.

We  ordered:
1. Penang Fried Kway Teow ($5.50)
-little moist and spicy level is acceptable

2. Crispy Sheng Mian ($5.50)
-
3. Thai Style Tofu ($6.00~)
- light on the batter, crispy on the outside but soft on the insight.
- appetizing to kick start your meal

4. Sweet & Sour Fish ($9.90 promo)
- nicely fried and fish is quite meaty"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnJYRmpnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"The assam laksa is not bad but quite spicy! 🌶 the char kway teow is above average, same as the chendol. Might go again if I’m missing these famous Penang food."

The char Kuey Teow -passed
Ambla  drinks- passed
Laksa -passed
Nutmeg drinks - passed
Water spinach with squid - what happen to the sauce?
Fried pork belly with Red yeast rice fermented beancurd - Fantastic (must try)
The fried fish with Thai sauce and another one with sweet and sour sauce - passed
Pandan leaf chicken - juicy
Chendol - passed

Will come again

Recommended with 2 thumbs up"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcnUycDh3RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,1,"The food standard had dropped so much that this will be my last visit. From the 2 dishes I ordered today, both are NOT Penang food.

I have nearly mistaken the Char Kway Teow as Thai fried pad thai due to the raw beansprouts.

Next come to the Penang Loh Bak, I have to double confirm the dishes name on the menu at the end of my meals. It taste like the ngoh hiang. It also didn't serve with the dipping chilli and loh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1blpiMkJnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,1,"Bad service experience. Took over 20 mins to fry up the prawn paste chicken and fried otah. Had to chase them, otherwise they kept serving customers that ordered after I ordered and paid. Cashier aunty also very rude. Ignore me after I complained, kept screaming at her staff.

In the end prawn paste chicken is tasteless. No prawn paste flavour at all. They even dare to put it as a signature dish of their restaurant. lol what a joke"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNE1fY0JnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,3,"First time here. Was attracted by the Penang Assam laksa. Came in for a try as I thought most of the dishes look authentic malaysia-kl style. Ordered laksa. The soup is flavourful, however there isn't much 'liao' in it. There were little slices of sardines and some noodles. At $4.5 a bowl, thought the quantity is insufficient. Glancing across other tables, other customers were having kl noodle, Chinese style fish, fried rice etc, all looks delicious. Think I ordered the wrong item."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdzd2TFJnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,Reasonably priced penang food. Tasty and value for money. But don’t expect anything fancy as it is meant for a regular meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbHUtTlV3EAE,Traditional Penang Food,5,"The dishes were delicious, get the deep fried fish, I crunched and swallowed the backbone. The Nonya and Baba flavours are fresh, tantalising - real authentic and wallet friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaUlXdnhBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,4,"Delicious assam laksa ($4.50) that brought be back to Penang for a brief moment at the first spoonful of broth. Generous with the vegetables and mint atop the addictive rice noodles. Could have been more generous with the fish, but still very satisfying overall!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3IyanV3RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,4,"Had Penang Prawn noodle - Broth was yummy and stayed warm throughout my meal (of 30mins)
Service was average but seriously it’s $5 for a very big bowl of delicious food ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteV9fVkV3EAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,"The fried fish was too dry.
Kuey Teow and others were okay
But the service was terrible, especially the one cashier lady"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhckl2MzBRRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,2,"I missed Penang prawn mee. Chance upon this stall behind a so-called back alley at Toa Payoh central just next to the bus interchange.

The prawny flavour is just not there. Well at least not enough. It comes with two medium sized prawns, half an egg, pieces of pork slices.

But for $5 it was a pretty big bowl. Hope they will improve the prawn mee soup flavour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aU5ueUpnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,"Go there 10 MTH ago , overall the taste quite ok..today take away few dish..the laksa only taste sweet , The salted egg squid very expensive not worth anymore.. won't go again. For those like Penang food can try (Island Penang kitchen)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaTVEMTNBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"The food is not bad, pretty tasty but it is still not even 90% close to Penang food. But points must be given for the effort for making it rather close to the actual food. It can be pretty crowded during meal time so go early. The Assam laksa is good but the char kway teow taste pretty normal. Go go and try if you miss penang food, you won't be disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyN3VuZVBnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,"I don't think the lady's service attitude is very good, I have given her three chances. I think the boss should educate your employees about their service attitude. If her service attitude is like this, I advise her not to do front desk service. - From traditional Penang food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcm9xaGdBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,"Ordered Penang char kuey teow and penang laksa, both  are really good. Authentic flavor. Love the kuey teow myself. Would definitely come back for more.
Not sure why the rating is not very high, but will definitely recommend to try out the food here! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ2Z6UUVnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,The Kueh Teaw soup is not so tasty. The asam laksa is lack of sardin. However the Thai style fried tofu is good enough. The service is not bad though. Hope they can improve the food quality.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyek5DbnpnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,4,"Had the kuey teow soup, prawn mee and Thai deep fried fish. Kuey teow soup taste so so, no pork lard, Singaporean taste. Prawn mee is big bowl, lot of noodle but not as flavorful as Malaysian Chiak, not enough pork lard, the shrimp is not fresh. The deep fried fish is good and cheap!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaXBYZUtBEAE,Traditional Penang Food,3,Not too bad.  For those who frequent Penang and familiar u will know that it is not fully and truly authentic Penang food. At least it is somewhere convenient when one need a quick fix of a simulation of Penang food.  Just makan makan for fun ok lah.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWJ2WENnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,5,Their prawn mee and Asam Laksa are the closest flavor to eating in Malaysia! So good and authentic taste.  I always come here if I want to eat those flavors!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Ml9lc3J3RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,1,"I don't stay in this neighborhood but previously I saw constant crowds streaming in so I wanted to try it myself.
But probably due to the fact that it's CNY day 3, most of the items were sold out. Even the chili for the Penang Char Kway Teow was sold out and I had this blend CKT, goes with their signature fried fermented bean curd pork, which doesn't have enough of the fermented bean curd taste and most of the portion was fats instead of meat. Chendol lacks of Gula melaka taste, good for those who don't want their dessert to be sweet.
And one and off you will get shouting from the kitchen staff (and a full 7 letter vulgarity for the CNY day 03)
Overall it was a disappointed meal and I can't get why people will still patronise them. Never again for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndk1EY3h3RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"The place is alright I Guess if you are in the neighbourhood and wants to eat Penang food. It is no difference in hawker centre food. While the fried kway Tiao is not oily, it is also very bland. The Penang laksa tasted better but not as favourful as expected. The prawn noodle I believe it’s a murdering tool, who puts a big pile of chilli in a small bowl of food. The chendol definitely can skip. Take note this is a cash term only shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb2VuMWFBEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,Penang food at afforadable prices. There r aircon seats inside. Staff are friendly. The laksa & char kway teow are not bad. The kangkong is a bit too sweet. The chendol has gula melaka taste & the green strands doesnt taste plasticky.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0lMS0pREAE,Traditional Penang Food,3,"CKT is quite decent. Laksa is good,  pineapple and cucumber are thinly sliced BUT THE ONIONS ARE SO CHUNCKY and you could cry even by looking at them."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNkxxQmZnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,"Ordered the Penang Laksa, Penang CKT and Penang Chendol x 2. Total damage $14. Price wise I think its ok. Taste wise I find it not bad. My mum thinks its very nice but we both find the cendol half-cooked (abit hard and powdery). Gula Melaka taste is just right but I prefer an even stronger taste. Otherwise would have given 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNajVIUU5BEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,"Not bad the food, definitely not as good as what you can get in Penang. But good enough for me to want to go back when crave for the char kuey teow. The cendol was nice too with gula Melaka. The 南乳炸肉worth a try too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkxHSWlnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,Service is basic. Food pricing is affordable. Order a penang fried kway teow which  taste like any other hawker centre similar food item. Order a deep fried beehoon with seafood gravy which taste nice but the deep fried bee hoon is lump together thus making it hard to chew and swallow.  The penang chendol taste nice but lack the sweetness of gula melaka. The drink I order is nutmeg and kumquat but you can skip it as it is ordinary with a mild taste not like the real drink in Penang.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbVlHLWVnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,"All good tried tasted not bad- char kway teow, prawn mee and chendol. Staff auntie was quite attentive. Ok to visit again."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMk1PazFRRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,4,Food and service was good. Serving was fast and the cendol was very nice..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOTd5cjdnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,2,"I ordered penang laksa, looks more like vegetarian laksa instead. Soup is ok, taste sour and spicy, but the toppings only had lettuce, cucumber and onion. At $4, not really worth the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHJ6M0RnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,1,1st visit giving bad experience to me and my wife. ordered the drink doesn’t deliver to us. The staff was told us we ordered 3 food with 1 drink. My order is 2 food and 2 drink. She didn’t check my order and listen wrongly. The kitchen staff giving that kind of eyes contact to us which make us feel like we are wrong at 1st. if possible i will give 0 star to this outlet.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyenJkRBAB,Traditional Penang Food,1,"RUDE ATTITUDE, BEWARE!

I went alone for my lunch and wanted to eat Penang food, but upon reaching there. It was packed with lunch crowd, I decided to eat at the china food stall besides it, as there were seats available. After finished, I thought why not have a Cendol, I politely went over to this penang food shop and asked one of the aunties if I can order from them and eat at the shop beside. One of them who looked plump rudely brushed me aside by saying.. ""Don't know, you go ask that china shop can eat or not"" OK, I went back and asked for permission and they said ok, no problem. I went back to order the Penang Cendol and said I seated at next shop.

The aunties started to gossip among themselves and very grumpy, grouchy about it. I told them the shop already said ok, since you told me to ask them. One of them asked me to pay up first in a rudely tone.. OK, never mind. I paid up and went to my seat. A skinnier with short hair and slightly grey hair bespectacled auntie came over with the Cendol and rudely said to me...""Next time, you come take yourself."" By the way, my table is just right next to their table.

Seriously! I paid up as per instructed and now i have to collect Cendol myself? and deserved your rude service? If can I eat at your shop, do you think i need to order from you and seat at other shop? You could have tell me not allowed in the first place and not showing me attitude.

Please use your brain and think.

The owner seriously need to train their staffs, since they are in the servicing line. If there is negative rating, I will give -100.

Bunch of cantankerous menopause aunties! NO MORE NEXT TIME!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTdHQU5REAE,Traditional Penang Food,3,Laksa is not bad according to my colleagues but the Penang Kway Teow didn’t meet my expectation. Penang Place Fried Kway Teow is still better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNeHBHQ3RnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"First up: if you're looking for this place, be sure to be look out for the Chinese signboard. Don't be looking for ""Traditional Penang Food"" in English now. It'll be a black signboard, with Chinese words in white. See my pic if you want to see what it looks like.

Secondly, note that my review is only for the chendol.

Is this chendol better than the one at Penang? I'd say definitively, no.

Ice: not finely shaved.

Noodles: nice green colour... No comments about colouring though, since I don't know what goes in there. But this is the brightest that I've seen of the chendols today (I reviewed Four Seasons Toa Payoh, and Dove Desserts earlier today). Unflavoured, which is disappointing.

Red beans: ahem if I want Penang chendol, I would be looking for those delightfully soft - and sweet! - kidney beans which I first tasted at Penang (and haven't found anywhere else since). You get a reasonable quantity of beans... But you should expect that, at $2.5, the most expensive of the chendols so far today.

Overall: nothing really strikes me about this chendol. It's middle of the road as far as I'm concerned... Or maybe I've taken too much chendol for today. I don't think so though. The gula melaka isn't generous, but you do get bits of it. The nice thing about it is it seems to come by default with *two* metal spoons, so in case you're sharing, you don't need to ask to one more. And the spoons are metal. An upgrade from the plastic ones that you get at Four Seasons, and Dove Desserts."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NmZYWWRBEAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,Reasonably priced penang food. Only the penang char kway teow and Assam laksa are worth ordering. The taste is average but such penang food not found everywhere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3NITlJ3EAE,Traditional Penang Food,1,"Prawn mee was tasteless, asam laksa was so so, doesn’t even have pineapple. Not worth the price! Won’t visit again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDekppVDZBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,The penang Laksa is delicious and generous serving of ingredients.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbjg2enBBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,I ordered grab food just now and there was one missing item not delivered. There is no hotline to contact grab food on this except for submission through a robotic app. I tried calling the stall and the person was apologetic and arranged their own to have it delivered to me. They took the initiative to do a service discovery. Very commendable. Thank you. Will definitely support you!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNkxLOXdnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,"If u miss Penang Street Food in Singapore, this is a great authentic restaurant. Penang Assam Laksa served with, "" Lao Shui Fen"". 😜"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeThpYy1BRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,1,"If I could give no star I wouldn’t want to give 1 star for this restaurant. Extremely poor service not worth your time to pay a visit. Ask the staff if we could sit inside, she rolled her eyes to us. Shout at us when we ask if paywave accepted or not."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNm8zSW13RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,2,Tried the char koay teow and it’s really below expectations for a Penang style dish. Not sure why there’s so many patrons here during lunch time. Perhaps the taste buds for real authentic standard of Penang food has mutated to Singapore local taste style of Penang Char Koay Teow?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTeTZfLVdREAE,Traditional Penang Food,4,"First time trying out their Asam Laksa and prawn noodles, pretty alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaDZyVzRBRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,I had the Fragrance Bee Hoon with gravy. It brings back memories of the old school taste. Nostalgic
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbGZ2cDJRRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,"Good service, able to get some traditional penang food here at Toa Payoh Central."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOEppQmRREAE,Traditional Penang Food,2,"Food is ok. Basically just Tze Cha food. Unfortunately the service standard needs to be improved. I get the sense that servers here are either highly stress or just unhappy with their work. There was no one in the queue. I was very very polite when I approached them but they were not welcoming, and seems to be rushing me to make my decision.

It was lunch time and I just ordered a one dish meal and again, they don’t seem to be please with my small order.

After seating now, I was asked to shift my seat due to distancing breach with their neighbor stall even though I was sitting in a seat marked “allowed”. After shifting I turned and notice another 2 tables who are very close to each other. Both gentlemen eating (more dishes than me) and they did not ask them to change table or position.

I won’t come back again. It feels like I owe them a living."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcWVyU0tnEAE,Traditional Penang Food,5,"Laksa was good, hard to find assam broth and ingredients were plentiful and authentic. Came across pineapple slices, mint leaves and fresh onion slices in the soup which added to the taste. Price is pretty affordable as well. Hope they have an option to add-on more meat in future as I like the well marinated chicken slices within too.

One complaint is that their prices on foodpanda is more expensive than in-store even after the 15% pickup discount. I understand they have to pay app commissions but I don't appreciate the lack of business ethics as a customer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbzd1SzNnRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,Good food at a good price in smaller portions so you won't over-eat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2b1BqMHR3RRAB,Traditional Penang Food,5,"Penang Food - tucked in shops opp Toa Payoh HDB hub is a hidden gem. Excellent staffs working hard to serve us fast delicious food too 😃🙌🏻

Their Assam laksa uses authentic Msia rice noodles. You will never find it anywhere else. Almost like being back in Penang. The gravy is rich and flavourful. Stall is generous with Vege garnish. Very fresh Veges

Thai style fried Sea bass fish is very fresh and appetising too. Crispy on outside, soft tender meat on inside. Highly recommended for sharing 😋

Can try their homemade Ba Long Long juice🧃

For the price, no complains! Best option compared to flying to Penang Msia in this no flying Covid season."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dHJHTG5RRRAB,Traditional Penang Food,3,"I like their fried kway teow. However, my friend didn't think much of her prawn noodles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMFBIWTRnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,4,"The star of Tonkatsu Special ramen is definitely the broth. 5🏅. Wonderfully rich bursting with meaty flavor but yet not so rich and oily to make it jilak. Ramen noodles perfectly cooked with nice bite and not clumped together. The onsen egg was also done well, soft melt in the mouth ooozze and flavor.!

The ramen is let down by the Cha shu which I personally prefer to be more well seasoned, more tender and more fat.

Overall 4 🏅 considering the price $10.90 which is good value kopitian ramen."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ME16elpnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen,3,"3.5 stars, friendly and fast service at 12:30 pm, no queue. Soup tasted more like our mixed pork organ 猪杂汤 soup than your typical Japanese ramen. The meat has not much fat and is quite hard to bite, overall this will fix your ramen craving."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXZmZTNRRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,3,"Hidden in a HDB estate in Ang Mo Kio inside @johnsoneatery332amk
which serves up bowls of ramen at very afforable prices. Arguably one of if not the cheapest ramen you can find anywhere in Singapore as their cheapest bowl of ramen here goes for only $5.90 that come with an entire torched chicken drumstick!! I was in total disbelief. The torched chicken drumstick is also available as add on to other ramen at just $4. Also their broth are made in-house and is boil for 15-hours.

What I tried,

Shinjitsu Ramen’s Tonkotsu Special (S$10.90)
Come with four big pieces of sliced chashu, a giant sheet of nori, and one ajitama egg, which had been cut in half. The tonkotsu broth is smooth, rich, flavourful and not too salty. The ramen noodles soak up well of the glorious richness broth. The chashu has a delectable smokey flavour, my only gripe is that it's slightly dry but that’s just a personal preference.

Shinjitsu Ramen’s Red Spicy Tonkotsu (S$8.90)
Pack with a pile of spicy minced pork and three big pieces of sliced chashu. The little bits of minced meat added a nice contrast to the smooth noodles and rich broth.

(Add on) Torched chicken drumstick (S$4.00)
I choose to add this to my Shinjitsu Ramen’s Tonkotsu Special ramen. This large drumstick has a gorgeous sear on the outside and is fork tender soft succulent. Absolutely delicious.

Pork Gyoza ($6.00).
The gyozas here are handmade fresh. Generously stuffed with minced meat and spring onions, and each bite was springy and juicy with the skin being thin, slightly chewy and a lovely charred bottom. This is a champion.

Grilled Squid ($6.50).
Big chunk of squid. Soft and tender not jaw inducing chewy, and you can just bite through. Is amazing.

Very affordable yet quality not compromise. Is really value for money, delicious for the price paid and generous in portion!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPODZTX3BnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,3,"Broth has mild pork broth flavor will sliced char siu gives that porky flavor.

Okay for a ramen fix if you’re eating there and priced reasonably cheap compared to ramen places.

Decent priced ramen for 11.90."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcE5lWnNnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,3,"Tonkotsu Special🍜🍥

🍜 Food wise: Egg is good, mouthful, watery and well seasoned. Ramen is quite Q. Cha shu, not too bad. Big Nori sheet. This bowl might not be suitable for me though, might need to give it another go for other flavours! But do give it a try!

✨ Ambience wise: Coffeeshop

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NGNyNEJnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen,2,Ordered tonkatsu ramen. The noodle is pretty Q and nice. The soup is bland. The meat is dry and tbh quite tasteless. It’s affordable though. Definitely cannot compare with other cheap ramen that are more flavourful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3ByNWxRRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,5,Really really rich tonkotsu broth at an affordable price point. Honestly up there with some mainstream ramen chains. Highly recommended!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdGNDbHlnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,4,"Tried the ramen before taking vaccination at Braddell Medical Clinic.
Indeed very flavourful and rich with the Tonkatsu aroma. However, in personal taste might find it a bit salty. Reasonably priced at 6.90 for a restaurant-like ramen."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMHRTaktBEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen,3,"Cheap ramen in a heartland coffeeshop? Where have I heard of that before? Broth was certainly thick with collagen. However, broth didn’t have the “oomph” and char siu was disappointingly dry and tasteless. $10.90 for this is excessive. $6.90 option is probably better value."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpek5peXF3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen,4,Very popular stall. Broth is pretty decent but slightly salty. I like the texture of the noodles but the slice of pork is not the soft type hence a bit dry to me. I like the gyoza but my partner wasn't impressed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOXMtMk5nEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen,5,"Based on the hardwarezone forum, came across this newly opened ramen outlet located in a coffee shop @ Toa Payoh-Braddell area. Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with Special toppings. Soup taste was excellent, with great collagen base in it. Ramen wise, the noodle is kinda thin, but does not lack the Q element in it, in fact it swallows rather smoothly, definitely great addition for kids and elderly. The aijitama (flavoured egg) have excellent colouring in it, which is surprising for non restaurant style ramen shop. The chasyu however is abit salty, but i guess is rather important for the broth. Taste similar to Keisuke Ramen. Overall, price is cheap and the quality is excellent. Definitely, a place to go if you prefer no queue, fast, tasty and a affordable ramen dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3BlTkN3EAE,Shinjitsu Ramen,5,Sets in a nice corner of the coffee shop and charges a reasonable price for the authentic taste of good Tonkotsu broth. The young man is friendly and entertained last minute change of broth. We will definitely support again.

The tonkotsu broth is thick and super flavourful with melted pork bits floating around, showing it’s the real deal slow cooked. Noodles done just right which are qq, portion more than generous. Once in awhile the charsiu may be on the drier side, but still tender to the bite, beating many ramen “restaurants”. Chicken clear broth gives you one big fat drumstick and thigh with a flavourful yet light soup base and generous noodle serving.

Did I mention the price? $7 for the charsiu tonkotsu and $6 for the clear chicken broth, it’s super worth it! This place will always have my support for an alternative for ramen Keisuke tonkotsu king which I feel tastes very similar and really good"

The maki rolls are big. The takoyaki squid in it is a lil small, but for the sauce and furikake its as what you get in Japan.

They have a tons of bowl selection of ramen udon and donburi. I might missed it, but somehow i didnt see Tempuradon.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a1o3WnJnRRAB,JJ Food Express,1,"Ordered food via the food court app and waited  7 minutes before the app said food is ready for collection. When went to collect, the lady had no idea what I ordered and had to tell her and waited another 10 minutes. All these tech is useless if your people are not trained to use them"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLUxfSHlBRRAB,JJ Food Express,3,"I ordered Teppan Black Pepper Chicken set.

The chicken came warm and the sizzling plate did not serve its purpose.

The chicken taste was bland and i’m not sure if the curry sauce was meant for this particular dish, i was not expecting it.

I ordered thru Koufu app, the food was ready after 8 mins"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMGFDVU5nEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,2,"Food is pretty good, service needs a lot of improvement.

- wait staff don't really care for walk-in customers and were quite reluctant to give us a table despite availability
- smoking customers outdoors not enforced despite non smoking signs
- we ordered via the QR code. After 15 minutes even the drinks weren't served, i went in to ask and the order wasn't even picked up until i told them. so what's the point of the QR code?
- food tends to be served slowly even when restaurant is not busy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa2VEZEx3EAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"Wide selection of sake, nice food and staff is friendly..the BBQ selection for those who is keen... order Edamane- boiled
soy bean, truffle chawanmushi (nicely present and rich serving of ingredients hidden in the egg with a little garnish of truffle)
Temputa moriawase (prawn)
Aspara asparagus with pork belly
Hotate- scallop with bacon
Buta bara- gfilled pork belly
Kawa-chicken skin
Tsukune- homemade chicken meatball
And not forgetting the Supume ika grilled japanese squid, (totally love it)
And a sake to go with it.. yummy...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhaUx1Y0ZBEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"Chefs are very friendly, you can get some unique dishes here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNU4tbmx3RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"Despite being new, the place is full! Their menu seems similar to the one in riverwalk but the prices are cheaper if I recalled correctly. Food is good and tasty. Enjoyed the tempura items (soft shell crab and prawns) the most. Service is good too. We ordered too much for 2 pax."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ19IallBEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,1,Extremely slow and poor service. Food was so so not worth the torture. They're not interested to do business. Came in and ordered. One other table who were there before us looked like they had been waiting a long time. Bad sign. The first item that came after around 40 min was a maki roll. The skewers came around the 1 hour mark. The last item garlic rice took soooo long to come after more than 1.5 hours. See photo. How does this pathetic small $10 garlic fried rice with no meat require 1.5 hours to cook? Cook rice from scratch also no need so long. We had to ask for it and the staff said they were already cooking. That was 30 min before it actually came. Even the lady boss could also tell we were upset. The place was rather busy that day they seemed to be hosting friends and family at least 5 tables of them. The lady boss was going around greeting people. Some of these guests are so familer w the place they were helping themselves behind the bar and walking around without mask. Some food items came out to their friends first even though they came after us. If you are not interested to host public then don't do business.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd05uckh3EAE,ikigai @ The Venue,1,"Service is not good, just walked in the restaurant like a self-service place. Weren’t interested in having us as customers. Food takes forever to come. Over an hour wait is unacceptable. The restaurant wasn’t even full. Pricing is also on the high side.

Only good things are the atmosphere and taste was alright, we just hope their service and wait time can be improved soon.

Update: Still waiting over an hour, repeated check-in with staff but nobody gave us an answer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcHVUZXZ3RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Good quality of food esp yakitori and gyudon (beef). No extra charge !!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNE1Qa193RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,2,"Food is alright. However wait time for food took more than an hour. Had to check in multiple times with staff to get follow up.

Ordering and payment was done through a QR code on the table using our mobile phones. Lots of times sold out on the menu. However, we were later informed that orders sometimes get lost in the system. Felt that if this was a problem, then this should be communicated to us first thing when seating us. Frankly, would have cancelled and left if it weren’t for the fact that we have already paid and it seems like they probably will take an even longer time to process the refund."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdnZQRzBRRRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"Good ambiance and We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. We ordered a couple of yakitori, truffle chawanmushi, mentai fries and Gyoza, all taste good. We will be back for more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyek83Um9nRRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,1,Food is not cooked. Waited for 2-3hours for the food to come and the food is so cold and disgusting. Food and drinks are all overpriced as well. Please don’t come as it will ruin your day/ night.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtanNiUkJ3EAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"@ Jasmine who wrote the review. Is not true. I have been there many times. If you cannot wait is not their fault. Looking at others assuming they waited long and not happy is your own judgement. $10 for a fried rice I would think is reasonable. Even a zhe char stall fried rice now is about $8. So I do not know what do you meant by expensive.

We can rate the food and service but should not judged what others are doing when we dont even know them..I dont see anything wrong with the lady boss going around greeting..this statement is a bit judgmental. Nothing wrong for her to go around even it is true. I think is not fair to judge just for a visit..think must be fair to rate the food but not judged people and put here online to embarrass her. She is just running a business..

The food here was great. Recommended many of my friends, they all love it. Waiting time was reasonable because of the crowd. We were patient and understand that the chef needs time to prepare and is worth waiting. Looking around, I could see there were many still waiting for their food. They all looked cool and enjoying their drinks. None of the customer showed any sign of impatient. Heard them thanking the lady boss for checking on them if they are being served..I could see there were many regular customers. Is a good sign. Good food is worth waiting. The price is reasonable. Will be back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNzhLakRREAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,"A beer house with Japanese food menu and quite a few selections of draft beer, wine and liquor. Good indoor ambience with a few outdoor tables. Great for couples or small groups."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHanEzdThBRRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Great place to chill and have Japanese food 😊
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdWIySW53RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,2,"Dined here twice. Subsequently tried to revisit on 2 occasions, but the staff were either missing (smoking outside the condo perimeter) or ignored 2 customers standing by the door."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ3Z1eUtnEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Hidden gem in the Potong Pasir neighbourhood. Food and drinks are tasty and priced affordably. Service from the owner Kevin is the highlight and will definitely be back regularly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOXRPU2RBEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Hidden gem that offers quality food at reasonable prices. Great service from staff too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLejhpT3RBRRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Great food and drink. Some of the best service we’ve ever had in Singapore and our favorite maki rolls yet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyek1hWmVREAE,ikigai @ The Venue,1,"Waiting for 2 hours and food is cold, pls don’t come to this place"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cUxyaGd3RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Nice place with nice food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta3FMY3N3RRAB,ikigai @ The Venue,5,Wonderful host.. cosy place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMkxyM1d3EAE,ikigai @ The Venue,1,Cheated by them! Ordered salmon belly but got normal salmon - for such a price $21.80 i think theres all grounds for a complaint here so others will know. Ur not a top end restaurant so the basic thing u shd be aware of n respect is trust and integrity and im sorry u failed miserably - and if u cannot uphold this then u shouldnt even be a business entity
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldEpieVBnEAE,ikigai @ The Venue,1,This place took 30 minutes to serve a plate of Gyoza. I don’t even need that long to make it from scratch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX05HTXFBRRAB,Pepper Kitchen - Toa Payoh,1,Disappointing. Added egg and they fried it with the rice so u cant eat it on its own. The photo is misleading as it shows a sunny side up. And ive eaten from other outlets and they always fry the egg separately.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVczR5RFRREAE,Pepper Kitchen - Toa Payoh,1,"Very rude service staff,  shouted at me many times. First time shouted at me telling me that my food is ready when I haven't even ordered. Second asking what I wanted to ordered. And lastly he kept shouting a number and while I was checking my receipt number explained very rudely that the number is the food I ordered. Food is decent pepper lunch standard but service is really bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2XzlDWE93EAE,Pepper Kitchen - Toa Payoh,1,"Rude and slow cashier, buck up on service"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDazhXWXB3RRAB,Pepper Kitchen - Toa Payoh,5,Very delicious would recomend people to eat
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcjRuZE1BEAE,Pepper Kitchen - Toa Payoh,5,Had a satisfying dinner here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzVLVTVnRRAB,Maki-San (Tai Thong Crescent),4,"Ordered Little San as takeout lunch. Selection for sushi was reasonable.
Service was quick. It was spacious inside but not too many seats."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMmYtc0J3EAE,Maki-San (Tai Thong Crescent),4,"Ordered via Grab, just a salad. Not bad, cannot comment much as the main dishes are still maki rolls which I did not ordered.  Salad has many choices of sides to choose from. The only thing is I wish the portion could be bigger."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHQzUGlBRRAB,Maki-San (Tai Thong Crescent),5,I ordered a Little San salad from this outlet at 8.45pm. Ingredients are still very fresh and overall taste is very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeGJDNVVBEAE,Maki-San (Tai Thong Crescent),1,Quality has dropped. Ordered a Mega San but salmon sashimi as thin as a crabstick slice. Feedbacked to the contact us email but lacked response
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdy1hRUJREAE,Maki-San (Tai Thong Crescent),4,"usually less crowded than other places nearby. if dont want to waste time queue, can come here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybHVXLXJnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"This bowl may look small, but when you pour it out on the plate, the serving was quite huge! I can’t finish the entire serving. Did I mention it was very yummy and fresh? Came back to try their mentaiko salmon. Super good as well!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OFltQ093EAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Presentation full marks! The prettiest bowl of chirashi I have ever eaten! Portions are very generous too, so if you are a small eater, the mini bowl is plenty. Flavour isn’t the traditional kind so come with an open mind. Overall a great meal in a fuss-free residential joint, cosy and friendly staff. Definitely worth a try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydDdtd2h3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,4,"We ordered 4 different donburis (salmon, premium chirashi, bara chirashi and eel) for dinner. Each bowl was nicely presented. The bara chirashi got the most of the attention with its OTT garnishes. A   party in your mouth awaits if you like to mix everything up.

The price point for the bowls were above the average Japanese family restaurant but the quality and quantity of the seafood more than made up for it. I heard from the owner that fresh catch is flown in 2x a week from Japan. Worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOUozXzBRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"We initially thought the prices to be on the high side but the portions turned out to be very generous, we had difficultly finishing our food. Fish was very sweet and fresh and the aburi and eel slices were seasoned with yuzu, making them very tasty. I think I won't bother heading to The Sushi Bar anymore as this place is so near my place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LWVMckp3EAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Visited twice when the restaurant newly opened to try out their promo dish. The Hana Bara and the mentaiko salmon don. Both dishes, despite being lunch promos had generous portion of ingredients. The third time, I ordered mini hana bara as takeaway and was so surprised to see the generosity in one bowl (assorted sashimi, unagi, aburi salmon and more)! The sashimi was very fresh and had crispy crunchy bits to give the dish a perfect finish. I hope this place stays open so I can keep coming back for more Chirashi!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N2VQYm1RRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"checked out Chirashi Sora on a Friday night as we were craving chirashi bowls and it was nearby for us :)

The fish was fresh and the portions were huge!! (Not complaining) only that we ordered one bowl each and none of us could finish - will definitely be back but will share one portion between 2 people in the future!

Felt really bad to leave without finishing their food. Just wanted to say that it wasn't because it was not nice or fresh but because I couldn't get anymore food into my stomach :(

Their green tea was really nice. Many Japanese restaurants serve diluted green tea since it is refillable but each time we got our tea refilled it was rich and full of flavour 😊

Will be back to try their other chirashi bowls!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMWVDbHR3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,4,"Went on a Friday evening. Ordered the Konoha Sanin set. The crispy pork Tonkatsu is perfect. Crisp on the outside and tender inside.

As for the Saba fish, they literally torched the raw saba fish infront of us till it’s cooked. But i personally still find the taste too fishy so I asked them if they could cook it longer. The lady then brought it to the kitchen and microwave it. Which after that I still find the taste fishy, and so I requested them to fried the saba fish instead which they kindly did so.

The highlight from the set is definitely the waygu where you torch each piece of the waygu to your preferred doneness. Since it was thinly sliced, I torched it to rare. I was really expecting the “melt-in-your-mouth” experience but unfortunately not. However I must say the waygu is still flavourful and tender.

I did not enjoyed the edamame though because I was expecting fresh edamame but they used frozen edamame instead.

Overall it was a fun, tasty and pleasant experience. Customer service is good. Price is slightly expensive. Ambience is cosy with anime themed walls. Be sure to make a reservation before going down."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMU9XRjhnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Unexpected gem :) The fish is super fresh and the mini don is good value for money compared to other chirashi places! Look at how much fish each mini don has! Also very instagrammable as each bowl is beautifully decorated with microgreens.

Had an issue with one of the dons (of no fault of the owner) and they were very kind to offer and exchange the don. Been a repeated customer and will definitely bring more people to visit this place! The cosy environment is also good for people who want to have a hearty chat over dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN2NXY1BREAE,Chirashi Sora,4,"The bistro is a short walk from Potong Pasir station and located at the ground level of The Venue Residences.

No crowd as i was there early.   This is an Japanese anime-themed bistro.  The wall deco and on-going screening of Demon Slayer.  Main character is Naruto.

The Crispy Pork Tonkatsu was super crispy at the outside.  Yummy max.  But the pork was a little tough.  The shredded cabbage wasn't as thin as i like it to be but it was good enough.

Food portion is good and it was neatly presented.

Follow my account and my IG: Joslovesfood for more food adventures!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dEszU1FBEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,The potion is very big even for mini bowl. The food is managed like work of art and I can feel the chef must be enjoyed in making the dishes. The sashimi is fresh and indeed a lot !!! A little Jem in my neighborhood and hope it can get more n more popular
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyalptT3FnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Amazing 🤩

We ordered the large Hana Bara Chirashi to share (two person) and were surprised by not only the presentation but also the variety of ingredients in it!

Rice were flavourful (not the usual plain white Japanese rice you would expect) and we LOVE the Unagi inside! Didn’t expect to find it in a Chirashi Don.

Soft Shell Crab were thumbs up to! 🤤

Will be back soon 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMnYtVmlBRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"We order shrimp, puffer fish (is sweet, I think kid probably like it alot) and salmon don . Value for money ☺️ look at the menu you might think it costly  , but the portion is huge(can share as 2pax), as you can see the unagi don 😁"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzZpTU13EAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"New Chirashi Restaurant, tried it on three different occasions and the standard & quality of the food is quite consistent.

They are very generous with the seafood and the rice has an additional flavour to it.

Tried the mentai salmom cheese don, kinda look like yu sheng (lol), was slightly too complex and heavy for my tastebuds, but my friend really enjoyed it.

The Bara Hana Salmon bowl was good, with pretty edible flowers. Love the freshness of the fish with a slight hint of sweetness from the egg & the pink floss thingie.

Friend had Sakana and we all really enjoy the tuna in the bowl & the huge cuts of sashimi.

Can try their chanwanmushi too, very different & refreshing."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdkx6VGFREAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Loved the hana bara chirashi! Portions were super generous and sashimi was fresh! The flowers were a nice touch and tasty too (hana can mean flowers in japanese) 🌸

The ‘normal’ portion was maybe 50% bigger than the mini one. I was stuffed from the mini portion🤰probably would have trouble finishing the ‘normal’ portion myself.

Will be back to try the other chirashis 😋

Edit: Went back for round 2! 👏 Had the hana uni bara (mini), chirashi, and hana bara this time. The uni is sooooooo creamy and fresh!

Chirashi tastes as good as it looks. The chutoro, swordfish, yellowtail, salmon, uni, anago, flounder, ebi… just wow 🤩

Favorite chirashi place 😍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaXNMWWZBEAE,Chirashi Sora,4,"Went there for lunch and ordered that Hana Bara Don S$28.50+ but was not expecting to wait 45mins for the food. Suprisingly the presentation of the don is pretty appealing, with generous portion of assorted raw fish cubes, foie gras, sakura ebis, tamago, cucumber & edamame, etc.  with the wasabi and ginger and they taste fresh. The little negative is too much of foie gras which make the whole bowl very greasy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbnF1RmFBEAE,Chirashi Sora,1,"The food was so disappointing. As a start, why is there corn in the ramen soup…

Service was extremely slow.

A5 wagyu was good tho…. Cuz it wasn’t cooked by them… beer also…..

Summary : come here if you want Japanese music, anime pictures around and some beer from the tap."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0lXclV3EAE,Chirashi Sora,4,"Dinner plans with a couple of friends, and decided to order from different places. So we ordered a Hana Bara (Mini) ($18.80 nett) as a takeaway order, and it took 15 minutes to prepare. Once done, brought over to another place just a couple of minutes away to dine in.

The block of brown in the middle was said to be a sponge cake, from another review, so when we tried...... We were confused, and couldn't really tell. 'Cause there were pieces of tamago with brown tops that looked like the middle piece, that tasted similar but not, you know? But not that big a deal.

Before I go any further, the main reason why this was a 1 star down was just because of the temperature of the sashimi. This is the first time that I have room temperature or un-cold sashimi don, which didn't quite sit well with me. I like my sashimi and sushi cold, you know? It's just the experience and expectation for Japanese cuisine.

Apart from that, everything else was awesome! The portion was huge, totally worth the $18.80, and not just the rice, but the sashimi and ingredients were plentiful! I love the mix of the furikake throughout the don, with the sashimi cubes and mixed into the rice. Everything was flavourful enough that I didn't need to mix the wasabi and soy sauce in.  Definitely can recommend to others!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtenZ2Umx3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Pork Shabu Shabu set with fresh meat cuts and vegetables. Good broth and sauces. Friendly and efficient staffs. Cosy, comfortable and quiet environment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHa051alF3EAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Amazing food!!!

Had the Konoha sannin set:
1) A5 miyazaki wagyu ribcap 120g - the beef was really soft & tender! Also quite fun how we can torch our own meat and add the toppings up our preference!
2) Crispy pork tonkatsu - Super good?! It’s crispy yet not oily and so flavorful! Better than tonkatsu specialty places actually...
3) Torched shime saba - super good too and flavorful! I also like how it’s fillet so it doesn’t have a ton of bones!!
4) Side dishes - the chuka kurage (jellyfish) was fragrant with the sesame oil, and potato salad is always a favourite!
5) Onsen egg rice (add on) & miso soup - I like how the rice has onsen egg and furikake on it

Overall, each dish was great on its own. Really loved the food and will give 5/5!! Also interesting with all the Naruto deco! Recommend!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeXVmbFRBEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Lovely little place. Food is fresh and really yummy. Would surely be back again. Visually a treat for the eyes and for the tummy too. Portions are generous. Staff are friendly and service is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aHRLRkhnEAE,Chirashi Sora,4,Good service. above average food. we ordered tonkatsu ebi set (the pork was well marinated and well fried). aburi saba was boneless and unique. they serve ice/warm water.  fries was pretty small portion for $6.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNnNfSnpRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,3,My ramen noodles still have the alkaline taste. Naruto and Iruka would have destroyed this place if they are real. The tonkatsu is decent tho. Overpriced for the quality of food served overall. Didn't get a chance to sit inside and enjoy the ambience as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXam9XOGhRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,4,"A Japanese style cafe with 10 tables in the Venue. It is 2 bus stops away from Potong Pasir MRT. Family friendly. It serves A5 Wagyu Beef, Aburi Salmon Don, Ichiraku Ramen, Tori Katsu, Tonkatsu, sake, Sapporo draft beers by tap, and other finger foods."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NzhTQndRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Restaurant ambience was chilled,

Ordered the Konoha Sannin, it came with their top 3 signature dishes, the Saba, tonkotsu and a5 wagyu slices. All three were really good.. think the Saba is orochimaru.. tonkotsu prolly jiraiya and wagyu gotta be Tsunade.. 🤣"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNDZ6bFl3EAE,Chirashi Sora,4,"My friend took me here as I had just returned to Singapore for holiday- we each had the Kaisen Chirashi ($25.80+), the torched kingfish with crab roe and the soft shell crab. Price is not cheap for the chirashi, but boy, the portions were huge! Did I mention that the variety of fresh fish on the rice was really generous and beautifully presented too? In the end I couldn’t even finish my own chirashi bowl and felt bad wasting so much food! The torched kingfish appetiser was incredibly tasty and the soft shell crab was nice too. Will definitely be back to try the fois gras and the truffle dishes as that was something I saw on the menu. Place is a bit out of the way though, and seating capacity a bit small."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbVplVVZBEAE,Chirashi Sora,1,"Very odd chirashi don. Are you one that like everything put Into a bowl? A rojak of flavours, texture and ingredients?And I mean, popped rice, chilli, dried shrimp, pickled ginger, turnips, cucumber, flavour rice mixed in with mushroom, a generous serving of wasabi, topped with generous slices of sashimi and a small piece of cake? Yes, sponge cake.

Personally, I prefer my Donburi taste to be cleaner and that I can taste the freshness and sweetness of the fish. In this experience, we weren’t sure what we were eating. The fish though generous did not taste premium. For $35++ a bowl, a lunch for 2 could send you away $80+ poorer easily. That explain why the restaurant was practically empty.

I don’t think I will be ever going back. Just too weird and a tad too pricey for donburi for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3ZmajdRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,2,"Food was great and portions were generous but the service was disappointing. Went there with my family a few weeks ago and was seated outdoors as there were no tables available inside. We requested to be moved inside once a table was available. We waited almost an hour for our food to be served and during that time we saw two groups of walk-in customers being given seats indoors. After mentioning this to the staff, they eventually moved us inside and a waitress rudely passed us their namecard and told us to make a reservation next time before coming. What a disappointing and awful dinner experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMVBuOGd3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,4,Food quality is quite good! Please make a reservation 1st as the place is quite small!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3ZqZU9REAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Exceptional chirashi. I thought it was a bit pricier when i first looked at the menu. However when the food arrived, i thought the quality and portion justify the price!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteUpudGNnEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Ordered delivery with small little hiccup but was very quickly and efficiently resolved by manager Vincent (hope i remember his name correctly) Food delivered on time and was very nice and fresh. Especially for the pork Tonkatsu although not as crispy but at least is not soggy at all. Salmon is fresh too. All the foodie were delicious and yummy thank you!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeUpLNFRBEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Very generous portion! Value for money and great food! Lots of parking available too! Ordering a mini size is more than sufficient.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXBXRmtBRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,A bowl of chirashi which clearly had a lot of thoughts put into all the ingredients. Will be back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdklYN1NREAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Our 3rd time here . A really nice drinking chillout izakaya place that we chanced upon .  We popped in for drinks once and were  surprised that the food  here are really good . Has been a weekly meetup place since that . Highly recommended !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta2RQd2t3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Spoilt for choice and decided to try the Konoha sannin experience/set.
Food is great and very laid back casual dining.
Our server deserves mention.
Michelle is very patient and accommodating. She definitely contributed to the overall pleasant experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOG9ubEl3EAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"Fresh, beautifully prepared and great variety."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcjVmazBnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,Awesome food and ambience! Finally found something decent near my house. Love the tonkatsu and the curry! 5/5 would def come back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dDhHeTh3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Tried their food a few times. Their food have been consistently good and price is reasonable. Personal favourite is their crispy pork tonkatsu. Shop with good ambient, highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd1BTRTlRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,4,Good quality for food. Can be a bit pricey but definitely value for money.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a2JMYjRnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Their foods are so good and as a big fan of Naruto, I love their ambience 🥰 Just that too bad they don’t have the signature Ichiraku Ramennn :("
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcUtPc3FRRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Thumbs up on their aburi saba and tonkatsu pork, nice chicken karage and chicken skin to go with alcohol. Cozy Ambience for small group gathering"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eDU2dU5REAE,Chirashi Sora,5,"proper tonkatsu at a decent price , what's more to ask ?

paired with great beer , and a fun environment, will come more often!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NzZTZXBBRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,"Great ambiance and food, delicious tonkatsu and self torched wagyu beef, which you can cook to your own doneness 👍🏼 Gin and tonic was well mixed, definitely a place that I will visit again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHZtNkNBEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Arrived here 9.40pm but was told last order already despite the operating hour states until 10:30.  Wasted the effort to travel all the way here 🥲 will try my luck again next time
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHek02cnN3RRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,This is our first visit. Impressed by the nice food and ambience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeE9HRzFnRRAB,Chirashi Sora,5,Excellent place to unwind with some grade A5 wagyu beef and sake
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNVB5OU9REAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Food was great and excellence
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcVpQSVVBEAE,Chirashi Sora,5,Nice food great service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MHZHMTZRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,"Located on the second floor and it was a tad confusing how to get up using the service lifts. I ordered via Grab and did a self-collection.

Food was delicious and the flavours were balanced. I like the flexibility of the menu. However, like most salad bowls places around the Tai Seng industrial area, I don’t find this particularly value for money if I were to compare it to similar places in the CBD, where I pay similar or lower prices for way more protein. So yes, while the food was good, I’m not sure I might order it again. Especially since macros and nutritional information isn’t listed like the usual CBD haunts I go to, which are way more transparent.

That said, they don’t market themselves as a healthy choice, so something to note for people trying to eat better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyalBEMHpBRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Small eatery on the second level of Tai Seng Centre. Loved their truffle beef rice bowl. Comes with soup and side salad. Great place for lunch but can get get filled quick by the office lunch crowd.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMkxMM1RREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Kind of reluctant to recommend this great little Japanese eatery as it will surely be more crowded than it already is. Friend had the truffle beef and it was juicy and flavourful. I had the spicy salmon bowl which reminsces of spicy salmon gunkan - fresh salmon with a chilli padi kick that is so satisfying. Service was friendly and prompt and the ambience was simple but cosy. Heartwarming and wholesome comfort food!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ME5iNkxnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"Ordered chicken katsu but they gave me some frozen chicken drumlets instead. Curry was some powder mixture as well.

A home kitchen at best."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdk9ham93RRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,3,"the diy bowls are pretty decent for the ingredients. but i ordered the truffle fries and the fries tasted very weird - its the taste of the overused cooking oil. granted it is during peak lunch hour, i still don’t think it’s fair to the consumers"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamRQbm9RRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,"Food was alright, though there are more value-for-money bowls of a similar standard elsewhere! 🍱"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MzViMnVRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Great pricing and for the quality and freshness well deserves the 5 stars. Located in a well hidden industrial building you will need to be intentional in seeking this place out but rest assured you'll be rewarded with some of the tastiest mentai salmon and pork jowl dishes. They have fresh sashimi too! Well worth a visit or two or three! When u are in the area.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxb1p1eEVBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,Good Japanese food for a good price. Good for a casual lunch. Kinda tight packed seating. Self service but the staff is very friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZzltSFl3EAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,I ordered truffle beef rice from foodpanda and it was so nice and flavorful. I will definitely recommend my friends and order again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHFxc2FBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"Food is horrible especially the Bara Chirashi Sakana Don, the rice  Is very soggy and sticks together like a clump"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUtiMzh3RRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Great experience here! Delicious and affordable bowls. 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN01LYXp3RRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,Great cozy atmosphere and nice Japanese food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaGJEWW9nRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,"Enjoyed our lunch here. We will return to try other dishes :) the mentai salmon was aburi even though it wasn’t stated but all’s good, it was still yummy! The place is abit quiet when we were there so no issues finding a seat :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNzlxSmFBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"My favourite hidden gem at Tai Seng! It really is quite hidden at the 2nd floor of an office building. Obviously you can tell I love this place because I have 5 photos of the poké bowl from different occasions (and many more I ate but didn’t take photos of). It’s operated by a group of Thai women and so they offer this sauce called spicy yum, which is the green stuff you see in the photos. I believe it’s the Thai seafood sauce made of basil, mint, chilli and other good stuff. Love!!!

Salad bowls start at $7.90, poké bowls are $11.90 and $15.90 for one and two salmon/tuna topping respectively. Usually “premium” toppings like tobiko, jellyfish or onsen egg are NOT charged extra.

Also great service and very receptive to BYO, although the salad dressing always comes prepackaged in a small plastic container so I ask them to pour it in directly sometimes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNzhyb1JREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,Great prices and excellent quality of food. The truffle beef don was spectacular and the crispy egg yolk fish skin and aburi salmon sushi was also great. I would definitely be back and recommend it to my friends
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbmRMZEtREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Small Japanese Restaurant in Tai Seng.  We ordered a Truffle beef don and a Bara Chirashi.  The beef is great, tender and tasty.  The Chirashi is good as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxb3RHaDRRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Friendly service. Truffle beef don taste is on point and at a decent price. Looks like it's quite popular during lunch hours so come early unless you are ok with a slight wait.

Pro tip: buy the $50 favepay coupon for $40. Works perfectly and you get 4mpd if you double up and load up crv as payment method in fave."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRX1lPakZnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,A underrated place located on Level 2. We went to this place purely from word of mouth. It’s a Japanese place operated by Thais and they also serve Pokè bowls which are affordable and delicious. Definitely recommend heading to this shop for lunch!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdXVqTzJnRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"A friend ordered for my birthday lunch via Foodpanda. Unfortunately, the tuna was sour, the salmon was acceptable but tasted slightly dodgy. Not a fan of the chosen rice. Also, gave me food poisoning. Not sure if the restaurant did not pack it well or the ingredients were not fresh or the food delivery person screwed up.

But when the food came, it was just in a normal bento box as pictured, no dry ice or anything to keep it cool. Weather wasn't very hot, and food panda only delivers within 3 to 5 km?

Had 4 courses of charcoal to get it out of my system 😭😭."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4X1BySVpREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Ordered Truffle Beef Set and Bara Chiraisi. The fish were fresh and tasted great! The truffle wasn't overpowering. The searing of the beef was great!! Slightly salty but with the rice, the runny egg yolk, the sauce and top it up with a bit of shichimin made it perfect for me! The portion was generous, too! It was a fulfilling meal!

The drink here was ice yuzu lemon. It was refreshing!

What a gem! Surely will come back here soon! Somemore with 10% cashback with Fave!!"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNby1ochAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Food is really good. The truffle beef was delicious, the beef was full or flavour and tender.  I dont usually like salad but the ones they served were so fresh i ate them all too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c0tIOEpnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Quaint little place at Tai Seng Centre with awesome food. Each item is prepared freshly from scratch ensuring the taste is just right. Highly recommended for a visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbHJHQVBREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,A great small little Japanese don place tucked away at Tai Seng Centre! Food was really good and worth it 🙌🏻

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbk5hY3BRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"This is my third time here and I feel like home always whenever I eat here. The owner is really such a pleasant person, and always serving such quality food with generous portions! The truffle beef don seals the deal for me, but the salmon 🍣 is just as great. Hope this joint gets the recognition it deserves! 👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNk5DdGNREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Great Japanese sashimi bowls! Definitely hidden gem.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNXB6Vy1RRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Definitely an underrated place. The food is super good and pricing is fair. The spicy salmon udon is a must try!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeFBLMkd3EAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Friendly staff and good food. Store owner Joob was really friendly and helpful. There was once I left my wallet there and she took care of it and called me to get my wallet.

Recommended food:
Chirashi
Beef truffle bowl (add foie Gras if ure up for it)
Truffle somen

Chicken wings are a good add on"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbHNycFhREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"I've tried their mentaiko chicken, truffle beef yakiniku and their teriyaki chicken and I have never been disappointed. Super generous portions, delicious and very value for money. All have been deliveries so i can't speak for service or ambience but 10/10 for food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbEsyeFpnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"The wait for the food was extremely long that is so ridiculous. I ordered a bowl of spicy salmon don, which I believe requires the least effort if you compare to the other dishes on the menu because you don't even need to cook the salmon. I waited 40 mins and when we asked about it, it seems like they forgotten about my order. I also noticed that other customers that ordered their food after us got their food much earlier than us. Seems like they don't prepare the food order by order, and more like just randomly see what order they received and prepare it first. Extremely unorganized. My colleagues ordered cheese fries as well and they only started preparing 1 HOUR after they placed the order. In the end, they had to ask for a refund because the wait is just ridiculous. Don't think I will ever come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMm9XNFVBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,Never ever order via food apps. They use their own drivers but delivered my food at 21:30 when i ordered it at 18:30. They never answered the phone despite calling multiple tines. It is clearly an horrible customer experience and the food arrived iced called.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcUxmeDVnRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,4,"Went here for a quick lunch from office, around 10 of us. Got in early so got food fast, there was quite a waiting when we were leaving.
The food itself was good, I had the teriyaki salmon. The service was very good, I had a special request and they remembered it even with all the rush."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpcE9XRUN3EAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,2,"Ordered via Grab Delivery, the menu said the Bara Chirashi had swordfish and salmon roe in it. When I received it there was only half a small cube of swordfish, and no salmon roe at all. That's pretty much lying. Taste wise was ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0Z1pILThRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Ordered truffle beef yakiniku Don with foie gras thru delivery service. The food is still warm, the beef is medium rare cooked and tender and flavorsome. There were salad and miso soup in the set too. Never expected such a high quality delivered food. I will definitely come and visit the shop soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOF9uZ0RBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,Had food poisoning after ordering chirashi don from foodpanda last night. Delivery time was alright. Tuna didn’t taste fresh. I hope merchant is more careful on handling the food as this experience is really upsetting!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bk8yNzdnRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,The poke bowls are amazing! The fish is fresh and the ingredients are so flavorful. Love it!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcGVMczJRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"Ordered from Deliveroo in July: small portions for poke bowl, not filling -> highly overpriced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJX1BEYThRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Loving the poke bowl I tried today very fresh ingredients are served. 😋 Yummy
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dHBUR1dnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Ingredients are fresh and combinations is great for me!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJemJLWEpnEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Visited JJak for the first time yesterday with my god-daughter and we both love the small but cosy ambience. The food serving is generous and when we sink our teeth into our Mentai and teriyaki salmon, we were immediately drawn to the freshness of the food. The Thai milk tea was excellent as well. We highly recommend JJak to anyone who love good food and we’ll definitely be back for more! 😋😋😋"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbk9tUFFREAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Very good portions and very healthy! I order via Grabfood so don’t know what the store front is like. The seafood is fresh and tasty, a good option if need a nice and healthy meal"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcU5yTGVBEAE,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,"Affordable and tasty food, one of the cheapest Sapporo beers in town. Friendly and warm staff. Definitely a surprise to find this gem in the heart of Tai Seng."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbTRYMTNRRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Good quality food and presentation at an affordable price
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N09YS3VBRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,5,Food is soooo good! They aren’t stingy with the toppings and you must especially try their cold noodles (it’s the best I’ve had)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcXBhVnpBRRAB,JJAK & CO. Tai Seng Centre,1,"I've food poisoning from at least the poke food from the bowl. I'm in pain the whole night, having diarrhoea and vomiting. I'll not recommend this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjhtM3lnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"3 star are for the foods only.
ordered bento set with additional add on. foods portion are full filling. salmon sushi are fresh. serving staffs are great  .. but the only downside is that the way they serve the foods. they shall serve the main course with the additional add on together ..
P/S : maybe should send the staffs for some upgrading courses .."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNXZyUGtnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,I think this is one of the worst review I’ve given but I still wana give them 2 star to encourage the owner to keep improving. Firstly they have a very wide range of food choices on the menu. And seems like an authentic Japanese restaurant… but very disappointed after you try them. The cha Siew ramen tasted exactly like an instant noodle powder soup base. Noodle are not fresh either. Sushi platter was the worst. Salmon Harumaki came very tiny and badly made. They didn’t give me the tamago maki as checked with the chef and said it was out of stock. Cucumber maki was bitter. Pumpkin croquette was ok as it is deep fried before serving. It’s basically food court standards but restaurant pricing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LThlUnVnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Went to enjoy the 1-for-1 kamo (duck) ramen $13.80 promotion. Service was warm and quick. Added on set A for another $4.90 - a drink, chawanmusi, 1 sushi & 1 slice of fruit & $6.90 set B same items as set A just with a tiny salad and 1 mochi. Chawanmusi and sushi were OK, the rest not worth it... kamo ramen was ok.
Tonkatsu $10.80 - crispy and came with nice sauce. Salmon belly 5 slices $11, fresh but the slices were uneven in thickness and sizes..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMVBIeHhBRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,Most of the item I would like to have was not available. The sashimi was presented like a bento set which I don’t know how to appreciate most important of all not fresh. The chicken was big in portion but not well marinated. The only consolation was the tempura prawn manage to meet the bar. Sake selection was bad very limited . Even the light soya sauce also taste funny and dark in colour . Staff was friendly. Overall dun worth the money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNWJiNWJnEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,"Ordered set on the menu. It was quite filling for lunch. Quite a big portion for the rice and the meat.
It was delicious 😋🤤

We were seated at outdoor, it wasn't hot but quite windy. But getting/calling the staff from outdoor was difficult.

Lunch hour wasn't that pack for this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaEtqRGVnEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"Quite disappointed with the foods. I won’t called it the Japanese food. Fried rice is oily and bland. Curry tempura, pretty much out from the Japanese curry cubes paste. Teriyaki cod fish, not really fresh.
Don’t think I’ll go back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMU02ejFBRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,seldom give bad reviews. So it must be really bad for me to do so. Won’t talk about service as it’s subjective. Katsu pork hard as brick. Ramen tasteless. Pork belly was terrible. Salmon look not fresh
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOGVLTVJREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Went on a Saturday afternoon, it's a nice cosy and well decorated restaurant. Ordered Ebi Fried Curry and Tonkatsu Curry. Both are okay curry. Service was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMUpLelZREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,"Tried this restaurant using Burpple Beyond. Got the beef Don which was surprisingly good. However it wasn't the cheapest, would definitely recommend to give it a try if you have Burpple Beyond."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycktlR2hRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"The salmon slice is very thin and doesn’t look fresh. The salmon belly is worse. So tiny, Feedback to the staff and say it’s normal size 5 tiny slices for $11. When I say Tiny it’s really tiny. (Size of abt 2cm x 2cm and 5mm thick?) my customer whom I brought him there is in disbelief of them serving us such standards.

I buy anywhere for $11, it’s definitely going to be bigger.
I won’t go back anymore.

I have attached the photo they show they will serve. Actual per slice is maybe 10% of what you see. They told me picture for illustration only. I was…. I didn’t managed to take a photo as my client finished it himself as it’s too little to share. Order at your own risk.

The unagi set w egg was still acceptable as in 5.5/10. Not fantastic but ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla09MYmhRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Used entertainer 1 for 1 bento/ramen. Very mediocre food. Ramen taste like Maggie mee, egg is hard boiled egg. Salmon sashimi was thinly sliced."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhbmFiQVdBEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"1. Ordered salmon belly sashimi but only 1 piece out of the 3 pieces is the real salmon belly sashimi (you can see the difference in the photo)
2. Avocado maki was poorly wrapped with the seaweed falling apart (in the photo also)
3. The worst is the char siew ramen!!! 1 taste of the soup and it's exactly the seasoning from myojo chicken instant noodles!! Any decent ramen chef will take pride in their soup base as it's like the soul of the ramen!
Try it at your own risk cos it's definitely not worth your money! This is my first & last time ordering!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldHFuSkt3EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,"We almost ordered everything from the menu! The taste was great and the lady who served us was great. She is attentive and warm when we ordered our food.
A simple yet cosy place to visit if you just need a place to ease your Japanese food bangs. :) Keep up your great work!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcWFXZWF3EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Not a high end Japanese restaurant. Taste and price wise well rounded and average if took on promotion meals. Not the freshest ingredients, but makes up for with other items. Service is good. Does seem like a good place to hang out with friends with few beers (around $10 per pint - standard price). Interior also nicely well furnished"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdTdQb3NRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Food was okay, portion sizes were okay. Staff was friendly but the ambience was dull. Not very lively place. Only me was there in the restaurant while other nearby places were kinda crowded."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOE9XLTN3RRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,Food was quite mediocre. Most flavourful thing on my table was the rice seasoning. Salmon sashimi was not cut properly. Miso soup and chawanmushi was bland. Even the shoyu wasn't very pleasant. Portion was good but taste needs a lot of improvement.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMElYMkFREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,"Sashimi was on the pricier side and the texture and quality isn't worth the price. The sashimi was average and quite small for its price. Out of the 10 salmon sashimi, there was an even smaller piece than the rest. The swordfish was more expensive than the salmon but it wasn't good and the size was small.

Regretted that I didn't check the reviews by others before purchasing from this restaurant. You can get better quality of sashimi from other japanese restaurants or Donki."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTcGNIZUx3EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,4,"Good selection of sushi, rice sets and ramen. They also serve kids meal but the ""car"" tray was unstable (one wheel missing). Took quite a long time to serve the food but we enjoyed it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydTk3eWtnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,First i need to be remark!! This is my first time for the review..i will nvr put reviews as im a very lazy person!! but this is the worst experience i had at this restuarant..wrong order then insisted the order is correct! I order sword fish but send tuna and tell me this is sword fish. Hello!! Im not first time eating sword fish lo!! Lol! The staff lack of experience and training..and the food is don worth the money..sashimi not fresh.. and the worse age dashi tofu serve in the restaurant!! No taste at all ..im like eating the plain tofu instead!! First time and my last time..thank you for spoiled my lunch!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGI3eWZREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"We are being reminded a few time it's last order at about 8.20pm to 8.30pm. At 8.40pm where most of my family have already finish their dinner and I am really hungry. I was being told they forgotten to cook my dinner. I waited for 50 minutes and they actually forgotten to cook for me. Sadly, there is no crowd at all and this mean they're NOT busy at all. The service crew and the kitchen aren't busy at all. It's not my style to rate a one star unless this really bad service experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnFxRkpBEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,I think they can be awarded the worse japanese sushi restaurant ever. Food is overpriced with super small portion. Sashimi completely not fresh at all. Order isnt correctly done up too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaWFhcVZ3EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"Food so so only when I first visit. Thereafter shopback gave loyality reward and went back for the complimentary reward. Reward indicates no min. Spending for the redemption but they insist you need to purchase a main and not able to redeem with purchase of handroll. They say is shopback issue and not their restaurant.

Not going back there again. If you are not agreeable with shopback T&C of the reward, you shld follow up with them and trash it out. You shld honour it while you trash out with shopback the discrepancy.

Not recommended."

Had a bowl of ramen (not shown which is the kakiage) which was a nice and comforting meal for a rainy day.

Didn’t know of this lovely place but thankful I made a trip here :)

Kudos to the young lady who served us, she was so sweet and patient. Great service!

Will be back here again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeVBtR3JRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"Mediocre food and long wait for food even though the restaurant was not crowded.
The ramen was soggy and starchy. The stock was underwhelming and was almost room temperature.
The chirashi don was worse. The sashimi pieces were very thinly sliced so much so that can't taste the fish. The rice at least was like normal rice.
The gyoza was very oily. There was meant to be 6 pieces of gyoza but we were served 5. Had to ask for missing piece.
Unlikely to go back ever."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNllueXRBRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,Bought the fave deal with the Japanese curry chicken with tonkotsu ramen with just SGD$19.80. Very surprised the food is really nice! The ramen is really Oishi!!! We love this so much. Fully recommend to come and taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4X3ZtdVRREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,"Used entertainer 1 for 1 here (bento only). We added the sets where $10.90 more gets you some salad, one sushi, one scoop of ice cream, chawanmushi, half pint of Asahi draft (lager/dark). We shared the items in the 2 bento and I enjoyed the salmon the most. With entertainer, full marks. Very value for money"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeXM2ekZREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,The food was good. The restaurant was cosy. And the portions seemed generous enough for us. Maybe we are small eaters or used to pricey food. But we didnt expect the serving sizes to be what they were for the price we paid. Will go again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MzVHUDhBRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,Ramen is average. Sashimi is way below average. There are better Japanese restaurants. Good for quick lunch though.

Took ~ 15 mins to Prepare (non-peak hour)
Service (7/10) waitress was friendly

Unagi - (7/10) Acceptable Portion and Standard
Ebi - (5/10) Meh. Like Food Court Japanese store standard
Rice (5/10) just your normal rice or u could add $2 upgrade to “sushi rice”
Miso Soup (5/10) standard not outstanding

Unlikely to come back again as there are better options at this price point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwLUpQRk53EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,4,Came here for dinner. The place is outside the main shopping mall. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The gyōza was good. Ordered the tempura and it was great too. The tempura was done not to oily but just right. There are also some special ramen set that is value for money. The price was also reasonable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTX3JYclVnEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,"What you see in this photo is priced at $14++ on their menu. This place is nice and cozy, and the food comes hot. Waitress should have clarified orders because she got one of our orders wrong (Chashu don became Katsu don), and when we informed her about it after it came, she said nothing. I mentioned it again when paying and all she said was that she heard us say Katsu don. Not a single word of apology of sorts. Upon opening (we were there at 11.12am), we were informed that because they had just opened, there was no cold soba available either as the sauce just got put into the fridge. Generally disappointing but thank goodness for Burpple 1-for-1."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbmN5V3NRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"Just received my foodpanda order, paid $67 extremely not worth the price tag.
10+ sashimi which is super tiny portion
$9+ salad which is only lettuce with single tiny slice of avocado
$12+ of lousy made Ebi sushi
😓 total ripped off!🤦🏻‍♀️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMXBPU3ZnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Decent Japanese food. Ordered tonkotsu & duxk ramen, broth was tasty. Kakiage was not crispy though, it felt too much flour. Curry was also so so. The restaurant only have 1 female staff taking order, serving food & cashier. Kudos to her that despite the hectic, she still maintained her smile & ever helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJaDlQVnNRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,They should be that I have rated them one of the worst Japanese Izakaya in Singapore. It seems that the chef is not really focus in his cooking and rushing through just to get the food cook and done with any details. Bland taste and poor customer service. BANNED!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcVBYazJ3RRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"Simple setting Japanese’s restaurant at affordable price. Came here for bento lunch set at $19 with sashimi , fried chicken , rice, soup and vegetable. Fresh sashimi and tasty chicken. They served many other Japanese style food and worth a try. Simple and tasty.. will come for dinner too!

Updated with latest visit after 1 year.. jan 2021. Came here for lunch with my loved ones, enjoyable lunch with great deal 1 for 1 using some apps. The tempura curry udon was tasty and no overpowering. Perfect Grilled of hamachi cheek, spider maki were great but the katsudon kind of average as the chicken meat is too dry ! Loved the gyoza with perfect crisp outside and moist inside made perfect !"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGUyaDN3RRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,"I’ve never had such a bad sashimi in my life. Not well chilled, not fresh (tuna sashimi is almost black color) and awfully presented at a high price. You’d better throw your money into the wishing pond than wasting money on these sashimi that can get you poisoned. Living in this area for 3 years without trying this shop and this will be my last time. Crazy that this restaurant is still open, probably because of the 10++ Ashahi beer which is good. Should avoid at all cost if you’re craving for raw fish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc3ViczBnRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,This is what I like. Simple and affordable Japanese food. No need to be exaggerate or fine dining. Dinner set all to myself.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OTlUVVRREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,5,"This is probably the best Char Siew Ramen I have ever tasted, not your normal circular-shaped Char Siew that is cooked in soup.
The Char Siew is tastefully grilled with the right balance of lean and fat meat, making it juicy and succulent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2NmZTTVd3EAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,"Nice decor and service staff earned the 2 stars. Nothing much to comment about the food, we don't feel it is worth to pay for the price. Even takeaway sushi from competitive outlets are better tasting and presented. The rice grain used is not authentic for their Don bowl. Do look into the presentation and ingredients' freshness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHd1ppalFREAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,2,"Had the lunch promotion spicy ramen but did not enjoy it. Ramen noodles are quite too soft and vegetables were spinach that didn't felt like they matched. The lunch set came with a drink, salad & oranges. Soup broth was so-so, nothing really ""ramen"" about it.
Overall, I felt that the taste and presentation is quite comparable to what you can find in food courts - which made my lunch set not worth @ $12.90++."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaU5mTkNnEAE,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,3,"The pork was quite dry for the curry don, the hotpot was alright and quite a huge portion, can be shared by 2 persons."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLUlmRzZRRRAB,Kinzan-Ya Japanese Restaurant 金山屋,1,Food quality was atrocious. Everything was tasteless and portions were small. Even hawker centre Japanese food tastes better. Prices are far too high for food of this standard.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3FuMDZnRRAB,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,1,"It was very good with the right chef, I would give 5/5. Fresh, with sweet flakes. But with the wrong chef, it tasted bland and rancid. Oh yes, the fish stinks my entire room like trash (don't believe, buy it and try)
Now it's way worse. The sushis lack fish eggs and ingredients. Take a look at the photo! it's the most pathetic thing for your money. Doesn't taste good either, lacks ingredients. It been going on for the past 4 purchases.
Sadly I have stopped buying from last week."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5b295Nkp3EAE,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,5,"First time trying takeout shop, normally is having at their physical shop dine in, food standard compare to dine in I feel better here at takeout shop. The taste is fresh surprisingly. Price wise is cheaper also for some item, 10 pcs salmon sushi for $5.00. What a steel. Looking for a takeaway meal this shop is Highly recommend to go buy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMWQzSVJBEAE,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,5,Carmen who works as a cashier for the TOA PAYOH outlet was very attentive to my requests. Her professionalism and exemplary service is a shining example for people in the F & B service sector. She was also smiling at the customers even though it was crowded. I hope that the company rewards such employees for their great service. I look forward to patronizing this outlet soon.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWVLM21BRRAB,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,2,I loved the corn sushi because they make it well and it is hard to find elsewhere and it was very reasonably priced but they stopped selling it for no reason at all.

Went there at 9pm on a Saturday night and their staff already brought the barriers down and chased away customers.

Disappointed and will stop patronising this outlet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaHF5by1nRRAB,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,5,Always return here when I happen to pass by the area. They sell affordable sushi with decently good quality (sushi express quality) and fresh. Bought the salmon don for $6 and it was really filling. Another fav is the salmon duo which is 10pcs of salmon sushi for $5. What a steal!

Back at home, I laid out the sushi on the dining table. Opened up the wasabi and soy sauce.Then it was dinner time.
Each pack cost $4.50 and taste was good enough. Reasonably cheap for sushi. No wonder there is usually, a queue there."

The middle-age lady cashier tilted the sushi box sideway when putting into plastic bag which caused the sushi to toppled and is quite unfriendly over the whole payment duration.

Definitely need more training."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpN01mOXFRRRAB,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,4,"Firstly, I was really excited when there’s gonna be one outlet opening at Toa Payoh HDB Hub area.I got sushi from them last week and this week. Both visits were during lunch time.

However, on my second visit, the quality of service by the cashier was disappointing compared to the first time I visited.
The cashier during my first visit gave me chopsticks and the cashier for my second visit says it’s $0.20 for chopsticks which is reasonable but I didn’t get it.

The cashier did not finish my transaction before moving on to attend to the grab orders. The transaction took a little long. I think the quality of service could have been improved or they could have better manage their manpower in this outlet.

Above is my experience and I still enjoy their sushi, I just hope  to have a better experience the next time. Thank you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPc2ZIVzdRRRAB,Sushi Express Take Out @ Toa Payoh,1,I had food poisoning after eating the sushi. The food is not fresh.

Bought a total of 8 pieces of sushi and asked if I could be given a pair of disposable chopsticks as I was intending to eat it outside and also for hygiene purpose.

However the reply given to me was, “your sushi are all of individual packaging so you do not require any chopsticks.” I was infuriated upon hearing that.

It was ridiculous as it was not as if I did not buy any sushi from them hence I’m not entitled to a pair of disposable chopsticks."

Well,I have a amazing lunch. I be back  to visit  again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbmM2WndnRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,Never seen a udon like this. Very different from the menu. The soup was cloudy because of the beef. Beef was not fresh at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3BmMUd3EAE,Yuba Hut,5,Fresh n generous serving. Delicious  n  value  for money. Way exceeded my expectations.  Nice  experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeXVPLVJREAE,Yuba Hut,5,Enjoyed the champion floss maki with my friends. Generous serving of floss and roe on the maki! There were a variety of dishes to choose from and staff was friendly :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHZYYzZRRRAB,Yuba Hut,3,Food is average but the soyu is not suitable for sashimi.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OC02SXVBRRAB,Yuba Hut,4,"This place used to be Nana Curry. Not sure if the same management change their branding since nana curry had a lot of bad reviews the past few months or perhaps just a total change of management.

We ordered the salmon aburi don, unagi don, soft shell crab appetizer and chicken katsu don. All the dishes were delicious and well presented. Staff service was alright nothing fantastic but the waiter was responsive. There's many competitions around for japanese food but I wouldn't mind patronizing them again (fingers crossed their food standards don't drop as they are very new)

We didn't have issues with our food but the next table was giving feedback to the chef that the salmon was raw. Not sure if they ordered Aburi or actual raw salmon but the chef said it is suppose to be raw unless customers want it to be fully cooked. I agree somewhat but I think if customers want it cooked the chef can always offer to take the dish back and cook the salmon aburi style. Cooking sashimi cuts thoroughly is a waste but if the customer wants it more cooked why not compromise and do some changes to make them happy? Just gave me the impression that the chef wasn't willing to go the extra mile to help customers with their request."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeWFIXzRRRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"never again, the rice is just as bad as described by others and the raw fish wasn't fresh. hope I don't get food poisoning

if the owner/franchisee owner sees this. like seriously send your chef for rice cooking lesson.

your rice is seriously a disgrace and burning all the effort of the rice farmer. literally unedible.

the rice is mushy, sticky and dry at the same time.

waiter responded exactly as described by others with the blur look of huh really ah"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMlBqVjJnRRAB,Yuba Hut,4,"This is japanese cuisine (inside poiz center). My favorite is champion floss maki and chuka hotate. Tastes wise is normal, salmon hana maki is fresh, and the sushi is just nice. The wasabi is not fresh i think..Related the price i consider in the middle range. Average price roughly 16sgd(for 8 pcs sushi) and 7-8sgd for 4pcs and similiar price with udon. All menu has small or large portion, and of course the price will be different. Those that really want to have quick grab, you can come into this place and just order don menu ya. FYI, their portion is quite generous as overall.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LTdQRlZ3EAE,Yuba Hut,5,Small and cosy Japanese restaurant. This place serves value for money Japanese food but on a higher level compared to sushi express restaurants. Was surprised by the quality of food they offered here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM3BxZTdRRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"Worst sushi I ever had in my life.. The sushi’s rice is over-cooked and it became like a porridge-liked sticky texture. An obviously untrained waitress (who has no idea what customer service means, even after i filed a complaint and being nice not to be fussy, she has not say a word from her mouth, not even a ‘sorry’ or ‘thank you’). Lastly, an ah Beng chef who speak loudly behind the kitchen saying, it is not my fault by the rice fault....... what an experience and I will not recommend anyone to patronise this shop."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcEozYjdRRRAB,Yuba Hut,5,"Yum yum.
Ordered salmon aburi don and unagi roll.
The hakotate mentai was nice!!! (not in the picture)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdnRxSXN3RRAB,Yuba Hut,2,"Service is ok but probably because there isn't crowd at all.

Price for a such small establishment is very very steep. Easily matching almost to Sushi Tei.

Food taste is very average at best. Taste frozen. The flour used for the tempura is food court standard. Serving is also very small.

Considering the taste versus the price, wouldn't visit again. I spent $30 alone for the food which i can get at $15 at Sushi Express and taste better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM2JiMlNREAE,Yuba Hut,5,"Surprise that yuba hut serves pretty good sashimi, the aburi don is well torched too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbHZPWjhRRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"First and last time here, I don’t usually write reviews but I Ordered teriyaki chicken don cause I saw that it was the chef’s recommendation. For $7.80 plus service charge and GST, you are getting mushy clumped up rice and tasteless chicken. If I am being brutally honest, the food in army cookhouses taste better. Better off patronising the Japanese store in the food court."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNEpTQk1REAE,Yuba Hut,1,Worst restaurant in Poiz. Not fresh and portion extremely small. Chopsticks and spoon dirty yet don’t provide tissue to clean. Only wet tissue and chargeable. See  this picture never see any restaurant put spoon and chop sticks without tissue. Sure the basket is dirty and never wash.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybXF2bFZBEAE,Yuba Hut,5,Heard that the Chef David is going to be posted out. I will be very upset and will not visit Yuba Hut in Poiz. Love the way he prepares the food for us. Please do not transfer him out. As we supported since day 1. Tks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdzVtalFBEAE,Yuba Hut,4,"Great spot to grab a quick dinner. Food is served very quickly and is pretty decent, considering it’s just a little shop in a linkway. Prices are very reasonable for the portion size."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDlienR3RRAB,Yuba Hut,5,Love this cosy Japanese  casual restaurant.    Food exceeded my expectation especially the champion floss maki and aburi... affordably priced and great service from staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMXQ2TEdBEAE,Yuba Hut,4,"Went with my date to there for dinner. I think the portion for the don is a bit small and quite pricey and there was no serviette. The wet tissue was chargeable though. Service was ok.

I gave it 4 stars since the don was actually quite tasty. Hope they can improve for those stated above."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHZYWkFnEAE,Yuba Hut,1,Prices went up is understandable but not food quality. Before $7.80 for katsu don compared to $8.90 now is a lot diff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eU51M2RBEAE,Yuba Hut,1,"There is no updated timing for operating hour, the staff rejected us for dining between 3:30-4:30 when the shop is operating"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OEtpdGJREAE,Yuba Hut,1,"Poached eggs are cold

Torched Mentai is also cold

Whole place no aircon

Serve customer with burnt fries

Never again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdWRHMzhBRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"Worst customer service. The server took my son's drawing paper cos she said no drawing. Even told my son not to draw. For some reason she also didn't want to give us a fork when my wife asked for one. We even have to find a baby chair and set it up on our own even though we asked the server for a baby chair.

$4 service charge is hard to accept given the type of service we got.

Food wise, not bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHemMydXdBRRAB,Yuba Hut,4,"Portions were a little smaller than expected from the pictures. But overall taste was pretty good.

Would recommend to give the soft shell crab a try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeDVYcmlRRRAB,Yuba Hut,5,"I love the food in this place. Cheap, portion is just nice and really decent quality (btr than sakae sushi imo) for the price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN2FXN3dnRRAB,Yuba Hut,2,Service is very slow but I can't blame the cook or the waiter. There are only those 2 around juggling the whole tables and online orders. The management is working them unfairly and as result they got scolded by customers quite a lot.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM3MzNEpBEAE,Yuba Hut,1,Had dinner here today. Ordered a teriyaki don. The rice is terrible. Japanese rice cook until texture like porridge. They replaced but rice still the same. Not recommended. How can the chef serve this kind of food to its customer.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeTZDNHVnRRAB,Yuba Hut,3,"Expensive! Even of you decide to pay extra for something good, this is not the place to go. Average food taste with very few bright points.

The Ebi Tempura Don: the tempura was WAY too thick.
Chicken teriyaki Don: there was more skin than actual chicken.
Aburi Salmon Mentai: ridiculously small for the price
Salmon Aburi maki: only thing I ordered that I cannot complain about.

When they open I was so excited to have Japanese food in the neighborhood, but unfortunately this is not what you're looking for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWJMQUtnEAE,Yuba Hut,2,"Ordered the udon with chicken kaarage and katsudon. The udon portion is so small for $6.5 and the chicken kaarage is just too oily. For the katsudon, it's equally terrible. The rice is under cooked and the katsu is so oily.

I give higher than 1 star is just because that there is no queue and waiting time is not too long."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNXzVlOGtRRRAB,Yuba Hut,4,"A small little place but has great service. The wait staff on duty was polite and friendly. She was patient in answering my queries about the food and assisted me in filling in the form to order the food.

The food was served fast. The Buta Yaki Don was flavorful and the mekajiri sashimi was fresh. Although there were only three slices of sashimi, it is worthwhile to note that the slices are quite thick.

Price is reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food.

A nice touch was that the wait staff bothered to check with the customers on their opinion of theme food and service during payment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybDRmZGdRRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,Service is really bad here. The lady who served used to be good but now they change to a guy and his attitude is really bad.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN1BuZDNRRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"They told me our orders would take about 20-25 minutes. I waited mine for 45 minutes. I cancelled my order in the end. My 3 fellow diners had their food arrived 10 to 15 minutes one after another. By the time they finished all their food, mine has arrived. In the end I cancelled my order."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweDZDY3lBRRAB,Yuba Hut,2,"Don't listen to the five star review below by the accounts that looks like they were purposely created just to give a single review for this restaurant (two accounts, five star, one review only.. really?). food is inconsistent. prices are downtown japanese restaurant prices. Had the rice bowl , came with HARD BOILED EGG. R u kidding me? Rejected and demanded onsen egg as advertised on the menu. Took them 20 minutes and to my dismay , they served me a SOFT BOILED EGG (a.k.a kopitiam breakfast egg). And for 9.90++, no Miso soup? Service isn't great also (no one speaks English, so good luck if you're a foreigner or Japanese and can't speak mandarin). Why charge service charge then? Been here a couple of times, been disappointed every time. Once, we ordered 3 type sashimi and they substituted maguro with salmon (they ran out of maguro), however the price remains the same. The kitchen staff kept glaring at me today for inconveniencing them by demanding the onsen egg. Hello!!!? Isn't it your job to prepare the dish according to the menu? I'm just amazed a supposedly JAPANESE food stall tried to nonchalantly pass off their rice bowl with a hard boiled egg (and they did it to several customers)! You'd be better off having the rice bowl at kopi&tarts further down the linkway - at least they serve the correct type of egg, and it's cheaper too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhc04yMWJBEAE,Yuba Hut,1,"Please educate your staff. He refused us to dine in explaining that only fully vaccinated can dine in. There was two of us who had both recieved our 2nd dose 3 days ago, we had our proofs yet he wont let us dine."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdEtfdm9RRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,"Ordered sashimi platter and Su udon.
Sashimi strong taste of the fridge not the fish which indicates frozen fish not thawed properly.
Texture of sashimi is inconsistent, makes me wonder if this will be my last meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMXAzRndBRRAB,Yuba Hut,5,"Affordable Japanese Food, surprisingly good 👍😋

Shall come back again, hoping for speedier Food wait"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3EyeElBEAE,Yuba Hut,5,"Requested for cooked egg instead of osen egg.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdGRpLUZ3EAE,Yuba Hut,5,Steak don and salmon aburi don are best here. Steak is high quality for affordable price. The only thing is wait time is too long unless you order a takeaway.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVN3Y3Y01REAE,Yuba Hut,5,"Dont listen to the 1star review.
the katsu don is only $7.8 and it is soo good. all the dishes with mentai sauce is extreme good. everything that has mentai in that restaurant is good. extremely recommended"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMXRPWS1BRRAB,Yuba Hut,4,Food is great I will come back
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbHB5aTZ3RRAB,Yuba Hut,5,"Chicken katsu don very underrated — best I've ever had!!
Mentai sauce is also extremely good! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcmR5a0VBEAE,Yuba Hut,5,Delicious unagi and salmon protein bowls. Service is fast because not a lot of people.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNm9lRVpnEAE,Yuba Hut,1,"Seems to be short staffed and as a result, poor attitude and service. First and last time at yuba hut."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTOExQbEx3EAE,Yuba Hut,5,Affordable Japanese flair
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb2ViQnZnRRAB,Yuba Hut,1,Overpriced sushi express level food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4NjUyOUR3EAE,Yuba Hut,2,Ordered unagi don and my mouth is literally soaked with saltiness. Small serving as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhczVPUE53EAE,Yuba Hut,1,Katsu Don tasted sour to me and I don’t like it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMHYyU2FBEAE,Yuba Hut,1,Don't believe the 5 stars review!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOF9fZUVREAE,Yuba Hut,1,bad and rude service with bad food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdlBXaDFnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Nestled away at the foot of a HDB block, with ample parking. Food was good, fried egg was done really well but a little too oily. Tom yum soup (clear) was good.

Service from the staff was mixed - the lady taking orders was incredibly curt, but the servers were friendly and helpful. It is a good place for simple, fuss free Thai fix."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnZqN2N3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Authentic thai restaurant, even the staff are mostly Thai.

Taste of food is great and reasonably priced.

The must haves are the fish in lime, prawn cakes and pork collar.

Come early to avoid having to wait too long, though tables turn around quickly due to the yummy taste, which gets wolfed down relatively quickly.

End off the meal with authentic thai dessert - iced red ruby."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aWFtaFRREAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Came here for dinner.

Food was not bad.
Tom yum soup was good. Spicy, flavourful and slightly sour.
Salted egg chicken was good. Crispy chicken with sweet creamy salted egg sauce.
Thai basil pork was disappointing. It lacked the taste of basil and could be spicier.
Pad Thai was not bad. It was flavourful.
Papaya salad was super disappointing. Lacked the fish sauce to lift up the salad.
Seabass with Thai lime sauce was not bad. The sauce was flavourful and had acidic notes of tamarind which paired well with the seabass.
Red ruby was ok. The ice was too chunky but the red rubies were chewy and tasty.
Thai milk tea was good. Milky and not too sweet.
Lemongrass could use a stronger flavour.

Overall the meal was not bad just need to choose your dish wisely. Prices are also affordable. Would come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ1pXYnlBRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"My second time back at the Toa Payoh branch, i was surprised that the waitress recognised and greeted me like an long time customer. Was recommended to try their steam fish with lime sauce. Me and my girlfriend like it very much. Thank you for the friendly gesture
and great recommendation. I will be back to try other dishes. 😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveHNQaFFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Very nice and typical Thai food.  I have been here many times and still always my first choice whenever I craving for Thai cuisine.
Its not only nice food,  very cheap some more.  No GST,  no service charge.
Where to find?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejdUTEZBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"2nd table seated, but had waited an hour or more for food to be served. It seemed like they cared more about fulfillment of the Grab food orders since we had to wait so long. Even tables after us gotten some of their food first, this was made even more unpleasant with my hungry children.

What we ordered:
Basil pork with rice - first impression was terrible, serving of pork was also little, egg white was cooked too long as it was rubbery, though the sauce was okay. You can probably get better ones from coffeeshop Thai food stores which I used to get at Ubi.
Phad Thai - serving was small, really small. I also found the fish sauce lacking and this was supposed to be a chef recommendation
Pineapple fried rice - still ok, serving was ""average"". My kid could finish this, so it's ""average"" as there is always leftovers at other Thai food stores that we visit.
Fried Kway Teow with Beef - kiddo say ok not bad. Was alright but didn't tried the beef and once again serving was ""average"".
Tom yum (creamy) soup with seafood - ok, soup was the saviour. But I gotten a piece of squid that was mushy and was disappointed.

Overall, ok to eat but never will patronise this outlet given such waiting time for such food. Several better stores that serve much faster than this. Not hungry children friendly, but instagrammable with their signature neon sign"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOTZUaDRRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Best authentic Thai food you can get in Singapore which is cheap. Not service and gst charge. If you love cockles, this is the place to go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaV9IMlVnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Our 1st visit (09/1/22) as nearby and early enough to get a table. We're pleased with the place and foods, but the music bit too loud for the small space. Hope they turn volume down a notch after reading this and keeping both standards cum prices. Less a star for the loud music."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dThyMWFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Found this on google map and decided to give it a go! We ordered Thai Basil Rice, Olive Fried Rice, Kailan with Mushroom, Tomyam Seafood Soup (Creamy) & Red Ruby as dessert. Everything was good especially the Tomyam! Total damage - $26.80, very affordable! We will be back to try the Steam Seabass with Thai Lime Sauce 🤤"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXem9taEZREAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"I came here with my elderly parents and my wheelchair dependent sister for dinner. The entrance to their dining area is not wheelchair friendly but insisted that they are not opening the adjacent dinning room that has a ramp. So I ask for a chair with a back rest so that I can slowly move my sister to be seated on a chair. Unfortunately, I was told that they don't have any. What restaurant at this time and age not handicap friendly and neither are the staff helpful with our plight. What a disappointment regardless of their acceptably good food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNXJ6RVFnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,Absolutely lovely experience. Food was great and the hosts kept our party happy and lively. Omg! Go soi47!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHRHTktBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Had the jumbo cockles from Ang Mo Kio branch block 107 coffeeshop. Fresh stock and the chilli sauce came in 4 types. The boss is super nice and friendly, go all the way to accommodate my cravings. Even offer to reserve the table for me. Will definitely go back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM1lxb3NnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,This is what you get when you wait for 20 mins. They serve grabfood order first before dine in customer. Whoever comes here please be prepared to wait atleast 30 mins for your food even though shop is not packed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dm8ydVZBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good decent variety of thai dishes. Steamed fish is excellent if you enjoy fish! Thai fish cake and Kao Pao Gai is good too. Red ruby desert is bad. The shaved ice is coarse, the syrup taste just sweet. Overall food good; desert bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dmJHQUdnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Food was nice and price was decent. Only problem is that seatings were quite limited.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNFBDcFNBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Tried the green curry chicken, claypot tang hun with prawn, stuffed chicken wings, and Thai fish cake. All pretty good, best amongst these was the tang hun. Nothing stand out for me but all were pretty good. All these for $35."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcDgzc2Z3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Nice affordable Thai meal. Tom yum is a bit sour. Fried seabass is crispy. Liked the fried tofu too. Long bean minced meat was a bit too wet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bzdQZmV3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"There was a queue but there were many empty tables too. I asked if we need to make reservation. Service staff turned me down with a bad attitude and asked me to get back to queue. I was merely asking and wondered why many people have queued when there are so many empty tables. I have not tried the food but certainly have zero tolerance for poor service. Well so what you have good food but that is not an excuse for poor service. Not sure if food is good. Instead I went to Bangkok J N Thai food along Balestier Road. Great food, great service at awesome price.

If there is a zero star, it will be given."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajgzUTJRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,2,"Disappointing as we went based on the good review. Flavors of the food was tasting washed out…we ordered garlic chicken which was the worst as it tasted like chicken had been refried. Food was on the oily side. Fried chicken wings tasted like the pre packed frozen chicken, not the authentic Thai flavour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlajRLSGl3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"We had the steam fish with lemon. Tongan cream seafood soup , kailan with garlic plus red Ruby as dessert: all the dishes were tasty. I wld certainly come back again. Also the price is very very reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOU56VHZ3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Good affordable Thai food. I would give it a 5 if 7 didn't find it a bit too salty. The Tom yam was slightly more sour than usual.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlalBEUGdRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,2,"Find it a really average place. Fish maw soup comes w lil ingredient n soup not thick enough. The fried pork n the pine apple rice so so only too

Only thing it’s not expensive but I won’t come back since food so so"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaFpfQ21nRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Ate here on Hari Raya Puasa 2pm, did not realize their last order was 230pm! Enjoyed the pork collar (not shown), very yummy not spicy and not too greasy. Tom yum was too salty and spicy for our liking. But the main dishes were great. Ambience was similar to that of Bangkok outdoors, but cleaner (of course in sg)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneS02bGxnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,A decent but small Thai Restaurant. Food wise I think Nakhon is Better. The spicy lemon sauce fish dish didn’t really meet and satisfy my craving. Quite crowded during dinner time. Do make reservation if you would like to try out this neighbourhood Thai restaurant. Lady Boss is friendly though 😌
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bU1uamRnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"The dishes we ordered tasted good generally. Similar to other reviews, customers in queue were not seated even though there were empty seats during weekend dinner hours. Service staff without smiles, unlike traditional Thai places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcEttSXB3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good quality Thai food at reasonable (and affordable) prices. Helped to settle my family’s craving for Thai food, without needing to travel to Golden Mile. The parking is very limited for dinner crowd though, as the nearest parking spaces are mostly reserved for season parking after 7pm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4OGI2TzR3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Everything here, from simple pineapple fried rice, fried kang Kong with sambal, basil pork, fish cake, to iced Thai milk tea and dessert red ruby, everything is authentic Thai food and very delicious. I wish I had a bottomless stomach to try all the dishes here! Will definitely come back again for Tomyam Soup, Pad Thai and other stuff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM3B1b09nEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Authentic Thai taste + value for money price point, makes this place a winner, beating the Thai restaurants found in malls. Queues are common at the usual peak hours and a 30min queue (at least) is expected, no reservations are accepted. The down side is the lack of white regular lots as the car park is 95% red lots 7pm onwards. Check out the pics I took as we had a spread of dishes!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNU5XV2FnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Want compliment 2 servers name sally/Aying  both are really good performance and efficient even shop are busy 👍👍👍 need give extra bonus . Btw foods are delicious.  Me and husband recommend TPY outlets , we will come back to eat 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcGJManN3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"If you wanna eat here, you gotta come early cos queues can get pretty crazy within an hour of opening. Great food at super reasonable prices, in a low fuss setting. Service may take a while when things get busy so be patient! Expect endless chatter from big groups, so forget about intimate conversation. Just go, slurp loudly, eat with gusto, order and order some more, order to bring home for supper and enjoy the experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkxtSHFRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,This place is great for affordable thai food. My whole meal cost $49. The steam sea bass with lime sauce is the best. A taste of zesty lime with a punch of hot chilli combination. The stuff chicken wing also taste great. The long bean with mince pork and the red ruby dessert need refinement. Thai ice tea was great too. Service was good and crowd start forming during peak hour even though it is not located at toa payoh central. Remember to bring cash only.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaTczVUtBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Cosy and authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices! Each dish costs on average $6. The prawn cake was hot and crispy, tomyam soup was spicy and sour enough, green curry super creamy and egg fluffy and stuffed with prawns. This will be our new Thai go to restaurant in SG..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Xzc2dnJRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,Nice food. Dun forget to try their red rubby dessert..  Authentic thai food. Reasonable price too.. the staff is really attentive. Recommended to try it..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NHVDcW5BRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good Thai Food in Toa Payoh. Good prices. Be prepared to queue and wait for your food. Parking is a limited because it's for season parking. Aside from that, enjoyed the food especially the Green Curry Chicken! 👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN2JmeEtBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Omelette was great but abit too oily, tom yum and green curry chicken had the freezer taste, lemongrass drink sometimes very sweet and other times ok mango salad was ok lor olive fried rice was rlly nice tho"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aFpHQW1RRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,Seems typical Thai food .. everything was on the sweet side of usual Thai cuisine .. the vermicelli is pretty decent .. satay pork is nicely done .. tender and nicely seasoned .. ate on a very windy and idyllic day .. overall feel is not bad
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdzQyVzl3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Ate the tomyam w chicken, mango salad, olive  fried rice and Thai milk tea. Food not bad taste very authentic the chicken from tomyam taste like my mum's cooking and it has both sourness and spiciness but a bit too spicy for me and mango salad has many small shrimps inside taste very flavourful not like other places where they just dump mango inside but is also a bit too spicy for me.  Next time I will ask for less spicy. The olive fried rice taste alright nothing special just taste like fried rice from a tze char stall"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb2VuOXZnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Was surprised this place is quite crowded. Sitting area is limited & my sense is that they are not fully maximising their space, eg 2 person sitting 4 person seat. They can always spit the big table into 2 smaller tables. Food wise, it's normal thai food. Chicken wing & prawn cake were quite oily. Taste wise still ok. Basil chicken is tasty. For pad thai, the portion is very small. No gst nor svc charge. Ice water isnt served. This place is good for residents in the vicinity, personally i wouldnt travel for this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdHJhalZ3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,Authentic Thai cuisine taste! Phad Thai seems to be a bit healthier so it’s on the less flavourful side. Tom Yam was awesome. Portions for veg was larger as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeXBic21nRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,The best Thai food in TPY. Not exactly central but very accessible. Can see from main road. The fish is a must try. Opening hours in segments. Do check before heading down.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3b29TanpnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"New experience with Thai food.. Nice taste of each dishes... Suggested the Green Curry very delicious. Pineapple rice is a must into the dinner...
Favolous taste is dessert D1 made with sago and cocco, a taste never try, wonderfull.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVOE9PLURBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"I really love this place! Affordable and tasty Thai food. The best dish is the fish. All other dishes are yummy too such as chicken wings, fish cakes, pad Thai etc. But I'm not a big fan of their Tom yum soup... It gets crowded early. They have some seats outside and inside the restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdXJPNUhnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Deep fried sea bass was overfried, sea bass wasn't the freshest, the gravy was overpowering and not too yummy. Deep fried pork had a faint taste of frozen pork. Stir fried kailan was too salty and too sweet. Not worth a second visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjVUOWFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Surprised to try delicious Thai food hidden between HDB blocks in the heartlands. Recommend to try their green curry and their salted egg chicken! The food came quite quickly and the portions were just nice for a family of 4. Place was packed so we had alfresco dining and realised there was another space they had a few stalls down. Don’t expect good or friendly service for a place like this but come for the food! Decent price for quality taste :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHckpUZTlRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,Miserable Thai food. Served grab food orders first rather then in house guest. Simple dishes failed big time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM18ydDVnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"My family just ate at this restaurant today for a late lunch.  No complaints from the family, however my pad Thai was “ interesting”, no Chili powder served with the dish…. And the “chicken” looked more like something that should have been trashed.  I pulled most of the skin and gristle out and let them “throw it out for good”!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4X3JLZzh3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"rly affordable and delicious thai food!! pad thai was amazing as well as the whole fish! green curry and tom kha were good as well with lots of sauce!! highly recommend you order those with rice :-)

only thing is that the curry and soups are typically quite thin and doesn’t have lots of ingredients in them. i think that’s alright because the price is already so affordable anyway but just to keep in mind when deciding on portions!!

pick up was smooth and rly quick as well :-) thank u for the good meal"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLVlDdzhnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Good food, feeling satisfied after meal. Worth 15-20 mins wait during peak for the price (I would give a miss if longer). Sufficient staff and fast service. Variety of cashless payments available, use promo codes for some small discounts compared to cash (dependent on the app). Only bad thing is the steamed fish was not descaled properly, have to spit the skin. Parking at night is not convenient in the evening as nearby all red lots. (Reserved for season holders)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM08yc3hnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,Tucked in a corner of a HDB estate and came across quaint. The whole steamed fish with lime sauce was excellent and the rest of the food were not too bad. What made the dining experience unpleasant was being barked at by the waitress to put the empty gong shells back on our plates if we were done when 1) she could have asked nicely 2) provided an empty plate for the shells. Also it was excruciatingly painful to ask for a second serving of white rice which never arrived. I’ve never been in such a hurry to leave a food establishment. The steamed fish could never make up for the appalling attitude of that waitress.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa2RUcmxnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"Used to really love the thai food here like about a year ago(?) but things have changed right now and this place is really not worth a visit anymore! Would totally give it a 0 stars if I could. Recently visited the restaurant and all I can say is bad service and bad quality food. Standards have really dropped like no tommorow. So focused on delivery that they literally neglect the dine in customers, food took over an hour to come(and its not even all the food we ordered coming at once), literally had to cancel order half way because the waiting time was just getting way too long and the staffs were not even apologetic at all. (terrible balance between deliveries and dine in customers if cannot balance just off your deliveries gosh) Adding on restaurant definitely has some hygiene issues, place where food comes out is also place for return plates also saw staff touching some of the vegetable with their hands while placing the sauce. Terrible!!!! would not recommend at all if you want authentic thai food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMTlQQ2h3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Quesadilla felt empty unlike other outlets. Ingredients were unevenly spread too. The others were okay. Speed was fast tho, received my food in less than 10mins even though there were other customer(s) before me."

Will try to request for more onions😍 in future as we used to be able to scoop the amount we want, but due to Covid they now prepack them (garnishes and sauces) in separate small containers. Love my burrito bowl with plenty of 🌰"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTh2cXlRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"food quality and ambience is similar to other branches.

tried mexican cola for the first time, the sweetness is so distinct, it’s not my favorite 🤗"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaE9iaE5nEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"For the price and quality of food, you’ll find nothing else that compares in Singapore. They even have Jarritos. The staff is also great and make for a very positive experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdnMtUmR3EAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,First time trying here. Good food. Love the burrito bowl and soft tacos.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcEthVjlRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"I dine here at least 3 times a week. I love the food. However, the staff aren't consistent with their serving. There are days the rice will be so much more and hardly any meat. Another time, their burrito can be pretty light."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbU12bkpREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"I just had this for lunch with my family and it was not bad. It’s basically classic Mexican food and it’s good, just that we don’t particularly enjoy eating Mexican food so it was okay. The fries was good, crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. Taco was excellent, and nachos were good. Just note this, if you are thinking of getting a Burrito regular sized, know that it has a ton of beans and rice inside; portion overall very big! Service is efficient."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMmJTZDZRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"My daughter vomited and suffered all night after eating the burrito bowl delivered in the evening. I couldn't complain because I was in a hurry to go to the hospital, but it is a very angry experience. I enjoyed it as a delivery food for a long time, but recently, the taste differs every time I order, so I tried not to eat it, but it became the last burrito bowl. Pay attention to the quality of your food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcEl2UVBnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"minis promo for burrito seems smaller than usual 🤔
limited seats for dining in
staff didn't know table numbers during serving
but at least there's table service 😆"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNkpMdzJBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Nice burrito bowl but wish there were more tomatoes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaExmVnNRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,Presentation can be better improved. The beef portion size (which requires top up) was even smaller than the chicken (which requires no top up).. the taste wise is okay but can do with much more meat as only vegetables can be seen in the tacos.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnM3ZDFRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"I think I was discriminated against here. I am a regular of Guzman y gomez outlet in Yishun North Point. I always received good service and food from there and expected same from here. I went in at around 11.50, much before lunch rush. There was only one other dine-in customer. Even after 25 mins I didn't receive my order, while customers who came in after me kept getting their orders. When I finally complained, they gave me my order without cutlery or tissue. Will not visit this outlet again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejktZmZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"Horrible experience from fhis outlet! Staff are disorganised, they actually forgot about my orders! Apparently I am not the only frustrated customer that's waiting incessantly long. You guys need to put in a system of checking order fulfillment to have a basic level of customer service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bDVpWEpREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"Very average food, it's slightly pricey. The burrito was very bland, the rice in it was bland. The only thing good on the entire menu is nacho fries"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z05PYXBnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"I placed my order via Deliveroo. I realized i had the wrong item order immediately after i pressed the sent button. I then immediately asked Deliveroo to help cancel my order via live chat. But the Deliveroo chat told me the order could not be canceled as the delivery was already on the way. How can the delivery be on the way 1-2 minutes after the order was sent in?

I tried to call the restaurant five times, but nobody answered the call. This will be the last time i order from this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXJqOVZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"First time trying this mexican food chain and I must say Im pleasantly surprised! Ordered from foodpanda but the food was still fresh! Got the mild nachos with grilled chicken. For $16, the price was quite expensive but it was really filling which was unexpected!! The guac was delicious too :) Will definitely try their tacos and burritos next!!"

Times ordered ready: 40+
Food Quality: Great
Timeliness: Excellent, never delayed
Taste: Excellent

Recommendation: Spicy Chicken Burrito Bowl with additional pico de gallo"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM3JyUVVnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Good place for an introduction to Mexican food. A little pricey but flavours are strong and good. Nachos and fries are great. Unfortunately they do not have salsa here so the strong acidity and spice is missing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeU9TWXdRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Best Mexican food in Singapore!

To be sure, there aren't many options for Mexican food on the island. Nevertheless, Guzman y Gomez food is generally high quality and eminently edible ... Though it may not compare to taco truck food in LA!

I stick to the spicy beef option for most dishes with the burrito or burrito bowl being my preferred choice. The quesadillas are also decent.

If in Singapore and craving Mexican food then GYG is your only choice. Thankfully, they have multiple outlets across the city to satisfy your craving."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeU5pNERBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,First time here. Nice place and crowded on a weekend lunch period. Ordered the Burrito chicken wrap and bowl chicken. Recommended to have with spice. Nice overall!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MmFTTndnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Staff were very professional and service was top notch even if it's a more fast food style place. Love the fries, especially the chipotle seasoning and soft chicken taco :)) I don't normally eat tomatoes but it's really delish as they take out the tomato seeds and its so nice together as a whole taco"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNlo3dWd3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,Used to quite like the food at GYG but the standard at this outlet has just fell off the cliff. Had the burrito bowl which had a pathetically small portion. Food was rather cold. Disappointing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxajlHakFREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Not much to say about it except it is just super tasty. Love their soft taco with grilled chicken or steak!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHAyOVJnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"On the GYG website it says the sauces are ""free at every GYG"". However, when asked, staff said its chargeable.

This outlet used to have great service but i think they got a new manager/supervisor somewhat recently and its just been downhill from there."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjM2ZHamJREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Can't go wrong with a good ol burrito bowl :-) Food's great, and thank you Kelvin and team for the warm welcome always!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NmQ2Vm5RRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"A little ""expensive"" for the portion you're getting. Food tastes okay. Quesadilla had very little cheese which was quite disappointing. The fries were fresh though (which I really liked). The Churros were quite good but nothing special about it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aVpiZV9BRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"The best compliment I can give this chain is that it's the Jamie Oliver of Mexican food. Proudly underwhelming, uninspired, overpriced yet somehow, you'll find one everywhere. While i can see how they might appeal to the undemanding and uninitiated, there is definitely much, much better Mexican food out there (and yes even in SG)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzeUpEMWVREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Tasty food. The salad was nicely done. The burritos was delicious too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cUtxaWNnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"First time trying with the wife as the reviews sounded promising. Ordered a spicy beef burrito set and a spicy pulled pork bowl set. Both were very disappointing... Very little meat in both, just lots of tasteless rice and beans... Miserable amount of salsa given. Food was barely even warm considering we were dining in... Chips were obviously stale. Not sure if they forgot to put the spice but both the orders were not spicy at all... ""Chipotle"" Fries, while cooked well, crunchy outside soft inside, tasted completely plain and devoid of any seasoning... Not sure if the outlet ran out of salt or what... The only thing that we both managed to finish was the lemon tea... Have tasted real Mexican food and this is not even close sorry. Went to McDonald's after..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN1pDc3l3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Hi there,

I love your food and there's no doubt on the quality. But recent my 2 delivery orders missed one item each. Last time set menu fries was not packed and today chipotle mayo was not packed. While understanding busy delivery orders, it is important to ensure customers to receive what they have ordered. Would appreciate more attention to pack better next time. Thanks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLM2R1WGJnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"My takeaway order had been missed and I needed to wait for a long time until staff noticed. Then, they forgot to provide utensils for burrito bowls.Not sure if it is due to staff shortage, but unless you dont remind them, they dont seem to bother tracking the things in order. Food is not bad but service is lacking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMEppc2tBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"Food is fine. One staff was very rude and mocked my accent to other employees as I was ordering. I guess she thought I couldn’t hear her. If the owner of this restaurant sees this, pls get to the bottom of who this is (appeared to me a manager as she was holding paper, female, in her 20s?). Looks like some re-training and disciplinary action are needed. Very bad experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbXZQRnl3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Great food for the price. Hard to find food Mexican fast food in Singapore so this place never fails to satiate that craving
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMmVxSTRnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"It's a classic mexican fast food place, just that it's quite conveniently located right next to Novena MRT station. We had the burrito bowl, and the nachos fries, both of which were pretty good. It's the kind of food that I'll have for a quick lunch, but I'm not sure if I'll enjoy a proper sit down meal here necessarily."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeHV5SmhBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,2,"Food via delivery was always good, but somehow dining in turned out to be a horrible experience. Didn't take long for them to come up with our food but it came in cold for my friend and I with much lesser meat than usual.
Best to avoid dining in I guess."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybWZDV1BREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Always manage to get the place to sit. However the pricing has stayed flat but the quantity has reduced.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Z0tfazhnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,First time eating here and I was not disappointed at all the food was delicious especially the burrito bowl. Staff was very friendly. The place was clean. It was an amazing place to dine in. I would recommend this place!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeHFhellBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"My first experience  trying mexican food was at vatos urban tacos & was utterly disgusted by them.  hence was a little decisive on coming here. Glad i came ,the quesadillas & food here are delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ2VDSmZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Whenever I am homesick for some solid 'great quality' tex mex - I look no further than Sydney stalwart GyG.

The staff at the Novena branch are courteous, happy to take dumb questions, and exceedingly speedy with their order fulfilment.

Eating in, also a great experience (now that we can)

Overall, great outlet, great staff, five stars!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eHVhNnJnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,My to go order was missed and I ended up waiting for 20 mins. The person packing the food was right in front of me and didn't bother to enquire about my order number but instead avoided looking up at all. Only when I asked then they realized the miss but tried to avoid acknowledging it by saying they will start preparing it...which took 2 mins to be ready.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX2RlOFdBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Good, staff are helpful, would recommend, tho needs more seats"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMGN6SnN3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,A bit overpriced for the food... Fast and efficient for some Mexican themed food.

The filling was falling out as I was unwrapping the burrito and the tortilla wrap was soggy, broken and very unpleasant to eat.

Rating 2 stars for inconsistency."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLemVIaHNBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Sometimes I want to be induced into a food coma. When I need that, this is where I come. Pork burrito does the trick. Eat one and a nap is sure to follow. Puts me to sleep faster than my wife chatting in bed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ejhhcVd3EAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Service was prompt. Food is as expected, delicious and fresh. Limited seating due to distancing requirements so go early to avoid crowds."

The food is fresh and fast and the sauces to add to the dishes are delicious, but there was hardly any chicken in my burrito, it was mostly (plain) rice. Disappointing for Mexican, but OK if you have a craving in Singapore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWJYdG9BRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Just had the burrito bowl with pulled pork for lunch. Really good and the pork was so tender! A tad on the salty side but the corn chips helped!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdlBXaDFnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Nestled away at the foot of a HDB block, with ample parking. Food was good, fried egg was done really well but a little too oily. Tom yum soup (clear) was good.

Service from the staff was mixed - the lady taking orders was incredibly curt, but the servers were friendly and helpful. It is a good place for simple, fuss free Thai fix."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnZqN2N3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Authentic thai restaurant, even the staff are mostly Thai.

Taste of food is great and reasonably priced.

The must haves are the fish in lime, prawn cakes and pork collar.

Come early to avoid having to wait too long, though tables turn around quickly due to the yummy taste, which gets wolfed down relatively quickly.

End off the meal with authentic thai dessert - iced red ruby."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aWFtaFRREAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Came here for dinner.

Food was not bad.
Tom yum soup was good. Spicy, flavourful and slightly sour.
Salted egg chicken was good. Crispy chicken with sweet creamy salted egg sauce.
Thai basil pork was disappointing. It lacked the taste of basil and could be spicier.
Pad Thai was not bad. It was flavourful.
Papaya salad was super disappointing. Lacked the fish sauce to lift up the salad.
Seabass with Thai lime sauce was not bad. The sauce was flavourful and had acidic notes of tamarind which paired well with the seabass.
Red ruby was ok. The ice was too chunky but the red rubies were chewy and tasty.
Thai milk tea was good. Milky and not too sweet.
Lemongrass could use a stronger flavour.

Overall the meal was not bad just need to choose your dish wisely. Prices are also affordable. Would come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ1pXYnlBRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"My second time back at the Toa Payoh branch, i was surprised that the waitress recognised and greeted me like an long time customer. Was recommended to try their steam fish with lime sauce. Me and my girlfriend like it very much. Thank you for the friendly gesture
and great recommendation. I will be back to try other dishes. 😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveHNQaFFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Very nice and typical Thai food.  I have been here many times and still always my first choice whenever I craving for Thai cuisine.
Its not only nice food,  very cheap some more.  No GST,  no service charge.
Where to find?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejdUTEZBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"2nd table seated, but had waited an hour or more for food to be served. It seemed like they cared more about fulfillment of the Grab food orders since we had to wait so long. Even tables after us gotten some of their food first, this was made even more unpleasant with my hungry children.

What we ordered:
Basil pork with rice - first impression was terrible, serving of pork was also little, egg white was cooked too long as it was rubbery, though the sauce was okay. You can probably get better ones from coffeeshop Thai food stores which I used to get at Ubi.
Phad Thai - serving was small, really small. I also found the fish sauce lacking and this was supposed to be a chef recommendation
Pineapple fried rice - still ok, serving was ""average"". My kid could finish this, so it's ""average"" as there is always leftovers at other Thai food stores that we visit.
Fried Kway Teow with Beef - kiddo say ok not bad. Was alright but didn't tried the beef and once again serving was ""average"".
Tom yum (creamy) soup with seafood - ok, soup was the saviour. But I gotten a piece of squid that was mushy and was disappointed.

Overall, ok to eat but never will patronise this outlet given such waiting time for such food. Several better stores that serve much faster than this. Not hungry children friendly, but instagrammable with their signature neon sign"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOTZUaDRRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Best authentic Thai food you can get in Singapore which is cheap. Not service and gst charge. If you love cockles, this is the place to go."

We're pleased with the place and foods, but the music bit too loud for the small space. Hope they turn volume down a notch after reading this and keeping both standards cum prices. Less a star for the loud music."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dThyMWFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Found this on google map and decided to give it a go! We ordered Thai Basil Rice, Olive Fried Rice, Kailan with Mushroom, Tomyam Seafood Soup (Creamy) & Red Ruby as dessert. Everything was good especially the Tomyam! Total damage - $26.80, very affordable! We will be back to try the Steam Seabass with Thai Lime Sauce 🤤"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXem9taEZREAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"I came here with my elderly parents and my wheelchair dependent sister for dinner. The entrance to their dining area is not wheelchair friendly but insisted that they are not opening the adjacent dinning room that has a ramp. So I ask for a chair with a back rest so that I can slowly move my sister to be seated on a chair. Unfortunately, I was told that they don't have any. What restaurant at this time and age not handicap friendly and neither are the staff helpful with our plight. What a disappointment regardless of their acceptably good food."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM1lxb3NnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,This is what you get when you wait for 20 mins. They serve grabfood order first before dine in customer. Whoever comes here please be prepared to wait atleast 30 mins for your food even though shop is not packed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dm8ydVZBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good decent variety of thai dishes. Steamed fish is excellent if you enjoy fish! Thai fish cake and Kao Pao Gai is good too. Red ruby desert is bad. The shaved ice is coarse, the syrup taste just sweet. Overall food good; desert bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dmJHQUdnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Food was nice and price was decent. Only problem is that seatings were quite limited.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNFBDcFNBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Tried the green curry chicken, claypot tang hun with prawn, stuffed chicken wings, and Thai fish cake. All pretty good, best amongst these was the tang hun. Nothing stand out for me but all were pretty good. All these for $35."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcDgzc2Z3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Nice affordable Thai meal. Tom yum is a bit sour. Fried seabass is crispy. Liked the fried tofu too. Long bean minced meat was a bit too wet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bzdQZmV3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"There was a queue but there were many empty tables too. I asked if we need to make reservation. Service staff turned me down with a bad attitude and asked me to get back to queue. I was merely asking and wondered why many people have queued when there are so many empty tables. I have not tried the food but certainly have zero tolerance for poor service. Well so what you have good food but that is not an excuse for poor service. Not sure if food is good. Instead I went to Bangkok J N Thai food along Balestier Road. Great food, great service at awesome price.

If there is a zero star, it will be given."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajgzUTJRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,2,"Disappointing as we went based on the good review. Flavors of the food was tasting washed out…we ordered garlic chicken which was the worst as it tasted like chicken had been refried. Food was on the oily side. Fried chicken wings tasted like the pre packed frozen chicken, not the authentic Thai flavour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlajRLSGl3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"We had the steam fish with lemon. Tongan cream seafood soup , kailan with garlic plus red Ruby as dessert: all the dishes were tasty. I wld certainly come back again. Also the price is very very reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOU56VHZ3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Good affordable Thai food. I would give it a 5 if 7 didn't find it a bit too salty. The Tom yam was slightly more sour than usual.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlalBEUGdRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,2,"Find it a really average place. Fish maw soup comes w lil ingredient n soup not thick enough. The fried pork n the pine apple rice so so only too

Enjoyed the pork collar (not shown), very yummy not spicy and not too greasy. Tom yum was too salty and spicy for our liking. But the main dishes were great. Ambience was similar to that of Bangkok outdoors, but cleaner (of course in sg)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneS02bGxnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,A decent but small Thai Restaurant. Food wise I think Nakhon is Better. The spicy lemon sauce fish dish didn’t really meet and satisfy my craving. Quite crowded during dinner time. Do make reservation if you would like to try out this neighbourhood Thai restaurant. Lady Boss is friendly though 😌
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bU1uamRnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"The dishes we ordered tasted good generally. Similar to other reviews, customers in queue were not seated even though there were empty seats during weekend dinner hours. Service staff without smiles, unlike traditional Thai places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcEttSXB3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good quality Thai food at reasonable (and affordable) prices. Helped to settle my family’s craving for Thai food, without needing to travel to Golden Mile. The parking is very limited for dinner crowd though, as the nearest parking spaces are mostly reserved for season parking after 7pm."

I wish I had a bottomless stomach to try all the dishes here! Will definitely come back again for Tomyam Soup, Pad Thai and other stuff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM3B1b09nEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Authentic Thai taste + value for money price point, makes this place a winner, beating the Thai restaurants found in malls. Queues are common at the usual peak hours and a 30min queue (at least) is expected, no reservations are accepted. The down side is the lack of white regular lots as the car park is 95% red lots 7pm onwards. Check out the pics I took as we had a spread of dishes!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNU5XV2FnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Want compliment 2 servers name sally/Aying  both are really good performance and efficient even shop are busy 👍👍👍 need give extra bonus . Btw foods are delicious.  Me and husband recommend TPY outlets , we will come back to eat 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcGJManN3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"If you wanna eat here, you gotta come early cos queues can get pretty crazy within an hour of opening. Great food at super reasonable prices, in a low fuss setting. Service may take a while when things get busy so be patient! Expect endless chatter from big groups, so forget about intimate conversation. Just go, slurp loudly, eat with gusto, order and order some more, order to bring home for supper and enjoy the experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkxtSHFRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,This place is great for affordable thai food. My whole meal cost $49. The steam sea bass with lime sauce is the best. A taste of zesty lime with a punch of hot chilli combination. The stuff chicken wing also taste great. The long bean with mince pork and the red ruby dessert need refinement. Thai ice tea was great too. Service was good and crowd start forming during peak hour even though it is not located at toa payoh central. Remember to bring cash only.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaTczVUtBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Cosy and authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices! Each dish costs on average $6. The prawn cake was hot and crispy, tomyam soup was spicy and sour enough, green curry super creamy and egg fluffy and stuffed with prawns. This will be our new Thai go to restaurant in SG..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Xzc2dnJRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,Nice food. Dun forget to try their red rubby dessert..  Authentic thai food. Reasonable price too.. the staff is really attentive. Recommended to try it..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NHVDcW5BRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Good Thai Food in Toa Payoh. Good prices. Be prepared to queue and wait for your food. Parking is a limited because it's for season parking. Aside from that, enjoyed the food especially the Green Curry Chicken! 👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN2JmeEtBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Omelette was great but abit too oily, tom yum and green curry chicken had the freezer taste, lemongrass drink sometimes very sweet and other times ok mango salad was ok lor olive fried rice was rlly nice tho"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aFpHQW1RRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,Seems typical Thai food .. everything was on the sweet side of usual Thai cuisine .. the vermicelli is pretty decent .. satay pork is nicely done .. tender and nicely seasoned .. ate on a very windy and idyllic day .. overall feel is not bad
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdzQyVzl3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"Ate the tomyam w chicken, mango salad, olive  fried rice and Thai milk tea. Food not bad taste very authentic the chicken from tomyam taste like my mum's cooking and it has both sourness and spiciness but a bit too spicy for me and mango salad has many small shrimps inside taste very flavourful not like other places where they just dump mango inside but is also a bit too spicy for me.  Next time I will ask for less spicy. The olive fried rice taste alright nothing special just taste like fried rice from a tze char stall"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb2VuOXZnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Was surprised this place is quite crowded. Sitting area is limited & my sense is that they are not fully maximising their space, eg 2 person sitting 4 person seat. They can always spit the big table into 2 smaller tables. Food wise, it's normal thai food. Chicken wing & prawn cake were quite oily. Taste wise still ok. Basil chicken is tasty. For pad thai, the portion is very small. No gst nor svc charge. Ice water isnt served. This place is good for residents in the vicinity, personally i wouldnt travel for this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdHJhalZ3EAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,Authentic Thai cuisine taste! Phad Thai seems to be a bit healthier so it’s on the less flavourful side. Tom Yam was awesome. Portions for veg was larger as well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeXBic21nRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,The best Thai food in TPY. Not exactly central but very accessible. Can see from main road. The fish is a must try. Opening hours in segments. Do check before heading down.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3b29TanpnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"New experience with Thai food.. Nice taste of each dishes... Suggested the Green Curry very delicious. Pineapple rice is a must into the dinner...
Favolous taste is dessert D1 made with sago and cocco, a taste never try, wonderfull.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVOE9PLURBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"I really love this place! Affordable and tasty Thai food. The best dish is the fish. All other dishes are yummy too such as chicken wings, fish cakes, pad Thai etc. But I'm not a big fan of their Tom yum soup... It gets crowded early. They have some seats outside and inside the restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdXJPNUhnEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,3,"Deep fried sea bass was overfried, sea bass wasn't the freshest, the gravy was overpowering and not too yummy. Deep fried pork had a faint taste of frozen pork. Stir fried kailan was too salty and too sweet. Not worth a second visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjVUOWFBEAE,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,Surprised to try delicious Thai food hidden between HDB blocks in the heartlands. Recommend to try their green curry and their salted egg chicken! The food came quite quickly and the portions were just nice for a family of 4. Place was packed so we had alfresco dining and realised there was another space they had a few stalls down. Don’t expect good or friendly service for a place like this but come for the food! Decent price for quality taste :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHckpUZTlRRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,Miserable Thai food. Served grab food orders first rather then in house guest. Simple dishes failed big time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM18ydDVnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"My family just ate at this restaurant today for a late lunch.  No complaints from the family, however my pad Thai was “ interesting”, no Chili powder served with the dish…. And the “chicken” looked more like something that should have been trashed.  I pulled most of the skin and gristle out and let them “throw it out for good”!!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4X3JLZzh3RRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,4,"rly affordable and delicious thai food!! pad thai was amazing as well as the whole fish! green curry and tom kha were good as well with lots of sauce!! highly recommend you order those with rice :-)

only thing is that the curry and soups are typically quite thin and doesn’t have lots of ingredients in them. i think that’s alright because the price is already so affordable anyway but just to keep in mind when deciding on portions!!

pick up was smooth and rly quick as well :-) thank u for the good meal"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBLVlDdzhnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,5,"Good food, feeling satisfied after meal. Worth 15-20 mins wait during peak for the price (I would give a miss if longer). Sufficient staff and fast service. Variety of cashless payments available, use promo codes for some small discounts compared to cash (dependent on the app). Only bad thing is the steamed fish was not descaled properly, have to spit the skin. Parking at night is not convenient in the evening as nearby all red lots. (Reserved for season holders)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM08yc3hnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,Tucked in a corner of a HDB estate and came across quaint. The whole steamed fish with lime sauce was excellent and the rest of the food were not too bad. What made the dining experience unpleasant was being barked at by the waitress to put the empty gong shells back on our plates if we were done when 1) she could have asked nicely 2) provided an empty plate for the shells. Also it was excruciatingly painful to ask for a second serving of white rice which never arrived. I’ve never been in such a hurry to leave a food establishment. The steamed fish could never make up for the appalling attitude of that waitress.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa2RUcmxnRRAB,Soi 47 Thai Food,1,"Used to really love the thai food here like about a year ago(?) but things have changed right now and this place is really not worth a visit anymore! Would totally give it a 0 stars if I could. Recently visited the restaurant and all I can say is bad service and bad quality food. Standards have really dropped like no tommorow. So focused on delivery that they literally neglect the dine in customers, food took over an hour to come(and its not even all the food we ordered coming at once), literally had to cancel order half way because the waiting time was just getting way too long and the staffs were not even apologetic at all. (terrible balance between deliveries and dine in customers if cannot balance just off your deliveries gosh) Adding on restaurant definitely has some hygiene issues, place where food comes out is also place for return plates also saw staff touching some of the vegetable with their hands while placing the sauce. Terrible!!!! would not recommend at all if you want authentic thai food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMDd1QjVBRRAB,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,4,"Passby here so went in to check it out n surprisingly the pineapple rice was really delicious! I definitely would go back for their pineapple rice again. One dish I wont order again is the soup, we find the soup tastes too plain. For these dishes plus 2 drinks total was $50. ☺️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNGRhQ0t3EAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,3,"Decor was interesting so gave it a try but food was average. Tom yum soup, Kang Kong n pork basil rice were passable. Can skip the vermicelli salad n oyster omelette."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteE92b2JnEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,An amazing discovery of good food in a hidden niche. Thoroughly enjoyable lunch at a reasonable price.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNmFDQlZREAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,3,Neighbourhood Thai cuisine at average price. Food is proportionate average with no surprise.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MnFhVGRREAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,1,"Wang Thai Kitchen. Blk 92, TPY Lor 4. We came here 2 years ago in  2020. The food was very good and we eat there regularly. However when we ate there recently we were disappointed. The TH milk tea that we usually order tasted diluted. Our favorite garlic pork dish is no longer what it looks and taste. Now it looks like it is not well cooked. No more golden brown and crispness no more. Dont taste good. Dry chicken curry  standard has dropped a lot.  The creaminess and flavour is very flat. The uncle waiter used to be happy and friendly. Now he don't smile at all just Stern face all the time. We highly suspect they have changed the chef. It is just no longer the tasty food that we were used to having. I don't think we will ever come back here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpN0xiOEFnEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,Cozy place for some well cooked and great tasting Thai food. The Chef is Thai.which makes the difference. Its not air con but is airy with good ventilation and fans. Make sure you also get a bottle of iced water!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dlp2eGFnEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,"One of the best Thai food in Sg. Ordered the Tom yum seafood, sea bass, crabmeat omelette, pork belly shrimp paste and none of them disappoint us! Will definitely come back again! Service staff was very helpful too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbzVPUU9nEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,4,"Did a double take when I walked past this shop coz of the super garden decor hanging from the walls and ceiling! Ordered some items to share and here's what I think:

1)Tom Yum soup is super spicy!!! Not for the faint hearted. Tastes great, but next time I will ask them not to put the cut chili padi inside.

2) Olive fried rice was salty (as it should be) but fried until fragrant too. Nice touch to add the thinly sliced mango.

3) Red Ruby with jackfruit to cool down my mouth after the Tom Yum fire."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHJMYXF3RRAB,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,1,"The food might be good, I would never know because we couldn’t even pay for the food. Ok sure, they are old fashion, no paylah, no paynow, no contactless payment, in short only cash or nets, even with a paylah sticker there below the countertop ( which is misleading) The staff generated some QR code for my wife to scan but this turned out to be a dead end as my wife’s money got deducted but payment was declined. While this is common in many restaurants, we are not faulting the restaurant for that but it’s the attitude of the cashier that suddenly became very rude. First he threw the receipt at us saying “look, payment didn’t go thru, I also dunno coz it never goes thru” (then why generate it in the first place) .So my wife asked him for help and what can we do now?, is there any other way, coz the payment went thru on our side. He replied, “then you all just wait, I also dunno what to do, payment didn’t go thru”. His tone was quite loud and not acceptable for me. There are multiple ways this situation can be handled but raising tone and being rude to customers is definitely not the way.  So we went away and tried to call the bank while the staff just ignored us and went to serve other. I got seriously annoyed by this lack of professionalism and manners, and once we managed to get the money back, we left. Once again, they might have the best tasting Thai food in the world, but with that kind of attitude, I would not step in that place again. If you want to go, bring cash/nets, then probably the staff will be nice to you.

Might be a blessing in disguise. Went to the toilet, and on the way, you can see how poorly maintained the kitchen is, not to mention filthy. Might have saved us on a case of stomach pain/ diarrhoea. My advice for your management : 1. we are in the freaking 21st century Singapore, not some ulu kampungs , update your methods of payment for more variety. 2. Talk properly to your customers. Who do you think you are to be rude? 3. Clean your kitchen or at least put a curtain to hide all your mess from your customers eyes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcFp5dmhnRRAB,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,"2nd visit there. Surprising find. Very nice Thai food. 1st visit we had their abacus seed, roast pork kway chap and lala bee hoon. All very good. Way above average and the abacus seed had an interesting twist to the non Thai ones.

This visit  as the sambal fried kway teow came out first it overpowered everything else. Highly recommended!! But if you are eating other dishes, taste the others first!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2N6Q0ZBEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,1,Very expensive.  Sour pumpkin in green curry but not replaced. Small portion. Paid more than $50 and still hungry. Won't go again. Bad customer service. First time and disappointed. Did not order any meat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3VlS0xnEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,Very nice Thai restaurant. Lavishly decorated with flowers. Friendly service and some very nice food. I always come here for lunch if work brings me to the neighborhood.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTY2WlNBEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,4,The basil chicken with egg rice is nice and generous in portion. My friends love the crab omelette very much. I personally feel that it’s tasted better hot. So do eat it hot if you order it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MFB6WE5BEAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,4,"The number of seats/tables are limited. But not crowded even on Sat night. Food were ok, taste just suit us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcEpfV2l3RRAB,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,"I’ve ordered a normal Phad Thai, which co gains fish and prawn. Considering the ingredient used, it’s very generous to its price of $6. By comparison, it’s far value for money and tasting to other Thai chain outlet present in Singapore. It would continue visiting."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODZYekh3EAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,"Never been to this part of Toa Payoh, was surprised to find this authentic Thai Food restaurant here.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdnM3MFF3EAE,WANG THAI KITCHEN 泰国美食,5,"I'm a frequent diner here with colleagues and the taste never disappointed. They have affordable lunch specials such as basil pork rice set at $6.80 and salted egg fried rice at $5.50. The portion is big and we usually share the fried rice among 3 girls.

Their homemade tofu and garlic chicken are amazing, must order for group lunches.

The owners are very friendly too! :)"

This is also one of the few places I know that serve abacus seeds, which are quite hard to find; they did a fantastic job of it too.

Will definitely go back, even if it's just for the abacus seeds"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMUtUZTFBRRAB,Soi Thai Kitchen - Toa Payoh,1,"Expensive like HELL.
Terrible experience.
The plates for all dishes are ladies' palm size. So you can imagine that how small is their portion for every dishes.

Radish Omelette $9 - So basically it's just 2 eggs (maybe it's rooster egg that's why $4 each) + few onions + very few radish. Radish omelette without radish taste.

Thai Kang Kong $9 - Imagine that you request 2 portions from mixed rice stall equal the portion this shop served to us. (maybe the Kang Kong import from Thailand lah)

Belacan Pork $9 - The portion same as you order 2 portions from mixed rice stall.

If the portion match with the price won't feel so dunlan."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHekxtX3V3RRAB,About Thai Siam Nakorn,5,"Tried the Thai Claypot Hotpot (jim jum). Not a lot of places in Singapore has this jim jum. $28 per set, more than enough for 2 person. The ingredients should be similar to the Mookata. The jim jum soup is good. The dipping sauce (nam jim jaew) is very nice and match very well with the jim jum. Value for the money. Good to eat especially during cold weather."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnBMckJ3EAE,About Thai Siam Nakorn,3,"I tried the $18 set meal which was promoted as for one person (set comes with 1 rice). Expensive considering this is just a stall in coffeeshop and that one of the three dishes was just deep fried omelette. The other 2 were tom yam soup and stirred fried mixed vegetables. Dishes were rather salty as they were not light on using fish sauce.  Perhaps it is just my preference. Fish (1 pc) and prawns (2 pcs) tasted not fresh. 3 stars given because of low score in value for money, seafood in tom yam soup lacking freshness, ok taste only and long wait."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bWNlc1VREAE,About Thai Siam Nakorn,5,Very nice Thai food!! Cheap and affordable. Tried the basil pork and Tom yam fried rice. Both is dam good!

Will definitely come again to try other food in the menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeUxiSnBBRRAB,About Thai Siam Nakorn,2,"Update: standards seem to have declined due to a change in management. The phad thai was sorely lacking in intense wok hei flavours and wasn't as moist as before. Even the addition of sugar and spice could not save the dish.

One of the better Thai food stores at Toa Payoh Central. Dishes are priced competitively, portions are sufficient and food quality is consistent with the multiple patronage.

The stall owners are also receptive to customers' requests. Favourite dishes include the plethora of fried rices (particularly the pineapple fried rice), phad thai (which they cook extremely well, it wasn't too dry, sufficiently moist and packed with ingredients) and their mango salad. Cashless payment is accepted here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcUt2QnFBRRAB,About Thai Siam Nakorn,5,"Do patron this new place as they serve very affordable and delicious food! We tried a couple of their dishes over 2 consecutive days: basil pork, tom yum (both red and clear), green curry chicken, olive fried rice, pineapple fried rice, pandan chicken, claypot prawn vermicelli, deep fried pork with garlic, seafood MAMA salad, stir-fry kai lan with crispy pork and stir-fry kangkong - they were all tasty! Definitely one of the better and value-for-money Thai food in TPY central."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbTlUTTd3RRAB,About Thai Siam Nakorn,1,Food was mediocre. The women taking orders was rude and disrespectful talking like we are begging for food. Better change her attitude if she want her shop to excel.

Ordered Basil Pork Rice, Clear Tom Yum Soup and their Omelette.

Basil Pork Rice was not bad. Flavour is more towards Thai taste buds.
Tom yum soup was good. Spicy and flavourful  with fish, prawn, tomatoes, onion, shimeji mushroom.
The omelette was not bad. Oily but could be crispier.

Im a regular of this Hom Aroy brand in Sin Ming but it was unfortunately closed for a few months since early January. This is the next closest Home Aroy you can find in the central area.

This stall is extremely busy during meal times especially in the evening. Be sure to visit early or be prepared to wait for a bit.

Service: 10/10 as well!
Ordered via Deliveroo last month but the stall was sold out on many items already. One of their staff called me and asked if it's possible to replace my orders with those available. When the food came, my green curry chicken was missing. Deliveroo didn't do anything, told me to Contact the stall so I tried to call their number online but it goes to their boss's number who was not at outlet. Their boss was apologetic and offered to give additional item on next order. Next order came around and indeed I was given extra fishcake on top of my orders. Had a small chat with the boss and definitely very friendly and keen on providing good food. Good service.

Sadly, my curry was still not refunded via Deliveroo, but not their fault... Was deliveroo slow processing."

Prawn cake : mushy, tasteless, feel undercooked.
Tom yum : picture shown is already after scooping ALOT of the oil out.
Basil chicken :  isnt it supposed to be minced? This can in big chunks of chicken and the taste was totally off. Don't remember it was like this previously.

Only edible food was the fried garlic pork and green curry.

Will never order again from this shop."

The plates of rice were served first served while we waited for more than 5 minutes for them to bring out the dishes while the rice turned cold. After we ate everything, it seemed that they forgot about our soup until we reminded the cashier. IMO, there must be customers who cancelled orders and left because of long wait.

- Tom yum soup
- Omelette

$9 for this amount is clearly unacceptable.

She picks it up with her long finger nailed hands and puts it back on the plate and proceeds to hold the egg down on the plate with her thumb as she proceeds to ask me if I'm eating here or takeaway. (In mandarin)

I can kinda understand picking the egg back from the counter and putting it back. But holding it down with her thumb on the customers plate with dirty long fingernails as she talks to me....

The kan lan with salted fish seem to have stir-fry both ingredients separately and mix them together at the final stage. Best is the pork with basil, a bit spicy but it was good."

The green curry has pineapples in it that gives it a sweet taste, unlike the other Thai places. We like.

The pork kailan had very few pieces of roast pork though. Wished there were more.

1. Tang Hoon is completely tasteless. Please skip it.
2. Red Ruby desserts came with ice cubes and not iced shavings.
3. Worst Thai milk tea drink I ever had. It is completely diluted.

Is the worst phai tai I ever ate. If is not because of convenience, I won’t come, never again. Not worth the $."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxN19MUnRRRRAB,Thailily Restaurant,1,"By far the worst mookata I've eaten in my life. no marinate for the meat and the soup is basically hot water. Really damn sad. Please, if you want to include mookata please at least have a minimal standard to upkeep."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbUlLeTNnRRAB,Thailily Restaurant,4,"First time trying. Only 2 staffs serving and cashier but they were quite efficient.  We ordered the $12.9 seabass steam with clear tomyum, curious how would it be with the price.  It was big, fresh and tasty. 4 thumbs up. We also ordered $6 chicken basil fried rice (big portion and yummy) and $6 fried kailan with crispy pork (somehow they served us just fried kailan without pork but we decided to accept,  it's a bit salty but ok). Will come back to try other dishes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3MklIbDlBRRAB,Thailily Restaurant,3,The steamed sea bream is sweet and tender. The Kai lan was also pretty good. Wouldn’t recommend the desserts here though tasted kinda weird. The red ruby was poorly executed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvcm9LekRBEAE,Thailily Restaurant,4,The food is good and the price is just OK. The place is clean and not fancy. Good waiters and quick.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNVluXzdBRRAB,Thailily Restaurant,5,"This place was recommended by my friend because of their Sea Bass (fish) promotion at $12.90. Good price for its taste and I was really satisfied. Initially wanted to order the steamed kind but unfortunately, it’s already out of stock. Guess it’s already good. Will definitely come back for the steamed style. Of course, Thai meal won’t be complete without Tom Yum soup. I opted for their Tom Yum seafood soup and it was a bomb! Can’t wait to come back soon."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcDZEMTJnRRAB,Thailily Restaurant,1,"Ordered seabass with tomyam coconut milk, basil leaf minced pork, pineapple fried rice and mango salad.

Pineapple Fried Rice: Extreme Failure.
Serving was huge, but the rice was extremely soggy. Absolutely not fragrant nor tasty.

Fish: Fail.
Even with the fire below, the entire dish was luke warm at most. Fish was very bland and coconut milk tomyam was just looking it's part without tasting like it at all.

Mango Salad: Fail.
Was sour as expected but totally lacking the spicy touch.

Minced Pork: Pass.
The ONLY dish which saved the day.for them.

Won't return."

I am impressed by ThaiLily Restaurant and will visit them more often.

Yesterday they forgot to pack my honey ribs. I message them in FB and they were responsive and responsible.

Just now, I went down and order dinner at Thai Lily again. Told the staff about the missing honey ribs. He okayed and I went for a smoke. Came back to restaurant and he packed an extra mango sticky rice. Said complimentary from his boss. So nice of them.

In term of food quality, they are above-average Thai food. The sea bass dishes are attractively priced at $12.90 and come in 5 styles, and my family love them.

They are located at Block 107 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh #01-268. Beside Phoon Huat/Redman Braddell MRT."

Green curry with rice (don’t remember price) and oyster omelette $9. Good taste."

Their Tom Yam Soup and Thai style fried Seafood Tong Hoon used to be very delicious now is just average. Fried seafood tong Hoon the noodle is bit soggy but at least the flavor still here, must stir in the chilli sauce which is a perfect match for this dish. Tom Yam Soup is now too milky and less spicy, lacks the herbs and lemon grass flavor in the soup."

Will be back to try their green curry and pork dishes. Highly recommended!"

Pork satay here was nicely marinated and barbecued but have very fatty layers, price is also on the steep side considering that it is located in a coffee shop. The stalls here are inaccessible for wheelchair user because of the huge step and narrow pathways, only seats at the outer part of the coffee shop are accessible."

Authentic home-cooked Thai food prepared by awesome chefs and the staffs are never lack of smiles (now you know why they call Thailand the ""Land of Smiles"").

Always friendly and courteous to compliment their great food. Price is very reasonable for such quality. Must try includes the tom yam soup and spicy basil chicken.

Has been to many Thai eateries throughout the island, but none came near D.K. In fact, the standard here may be better than what you would find in Bangkok!

If you're looking for some comforting Thai food, you know where to go."

Some items on physical menu may not be available on the online order because physical menu is less updated. Have to separately order fresh coconut in person but service staff is helpful & prompt.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaDUyMnZRRRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"surprisingly quite flavorful Stir-fried Beef Hor Fun. The beef cooked just nice , broth is richly aromatic. The “Wok Hei”, heavenly. I believe they prepare the stock well, I am trying to figure out the ingredients though. Lol…. Fresh juicy crunch on the vege, cook just right, retaining the texture and moisture. Snow Pea could used a bit of prep work to remove the thin fiber string on both sides. Portion wise versus taste and price, I would say this is worth it. Would recommend sharing for smaller portion eater.

Red Tom Yum Soup with Seafood, less spicy. I would say the spicy, sour and sweet balance would suite most. I’ll should take the original  spicy level though. A bit too sweet for me. Anyway, Shimeiji mushroom are yummy and have the fresh juicy texture. Squid and prawn wise prep & cook well, tender and juicy to enjoy. Can see the good knife works and skill prepping the ingredients. The chef really have some standards, I would say. The squid could have a smaller bite size cut though. Less chewing and bite with smaller pieces.

Overall, a delicious well balance flavored meal. Which is pretty rare. Yummy meal. I am surprised, in a good way.

Would recommend to try, while their food/chef/quality still in the season. 🤔😄…

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdk1DbGV3EAE,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,The standard of the food was rather disappointing. I would not really classify their style as thai. Flavor and authenticity was poor. Portioning is small and price is rather expensive qith that portion. Service was rather sloppy. Ordering app did not have the history of the orders for us to keep track. only enjoyable dish was the fried seafood kway teow.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXay0zZFhREAE,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"A couple of Sundays ago, after playing mahjong at the inlaws place and losing close to $40, it was time for dinner.
We decided to try the Thai restaurant, Siam Kitchen, which we had not eaten at before.
Placed our order for an appetiser platter and a seabass set. We got the glass of Thai milk tea that came with the set but was told we don't get SAFRA member discount with that set meal and so no discount for the meal. Disapppointing. 😟 Just as well that we didn't order dessert which looks to me was overpriced. Ended up spending about the same amount I lost at mahjong earlier.
The soup with meatball was served with the baked potato. The baked potato still tasted OK but the soup was too salty for me so I didn't like it.
The appetiser platter had a lot of food. I guessed it can be filling enough for a full meal for some people.
The seabass was last to serve. The taste was OK but not something I'd missed enough to come back for more.
The place wasn't crowded throughout. Diners came and left while we were there and the number of groups was more or the less the same before and after our meal.
Better option for dessert was McDonald's which was less than 50m away."

Red Tom Yum seafood soup was so salty like a full jar of salt was added in. The salted fish fried rice was also too salty. Waste of money as the other dishes like pandan leaf chicken and honey chicken were also not well cooked as lacked flavour. A total waste of money as not palatable at all. If can give no star, I would want to do that. Please check your chef's cooking skill before serving the food to your customer."

Just plain rice mix with soy sauce and add crab meat on the top. Fork & spoon crab fried rice more nice. Kailan also can't accept! Basil just a spoonful and throw in a bin. Not worth it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHd1pxVG53RRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"The mango sticky rice is nice.  In general, the food is quite good but too expensive. there are many Thai eateries which charge less and without ++."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeHBHTTVRRRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Would like to give commendation on your staff called hockseng and Xavier Seah on a Saturday night dinner, 3rd April 2021. They recommended us with good suggestions and all were good and delicious. Food also came on time and staff were really courteous and friendly always checking on us whether the food is good and whether all food has arrived. Definitely looking forward to have dinner with my family here again. :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb2JUTHN3RRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"The service staff tried their best but this outlet is obviously understaffed. An hour in the queue and a long wait for food.

If you plan to come during dinner time, you may need to buffer 1.5hours waiting time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bVpDOXdnRRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"Poor Service

The staff was unfriendly and difficult to attend to my needs when only my group of friends were the only customer there at that time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDQ3M0dnEAE,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,We went lunch on Sunday. Order tom yam soup and few dishes. Realize the soup was served with few pieces of mushroom and 2 pcs of slice squid.. Very pathetic seafood soup. This is my 3rd visit h
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbHFxLXJRRRAB,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,Went here twice and good thing that it was not crowded. Environment is cozy and food tastes ok and decently priced. Convenient place for dining after doing some exercise at SAFRA.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dk92TWJnEAE,Siam Kitchen SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Had the shrimp omelette and seafood pad thai with thai milk tea.

อาหารอร่อยมากค่ะ เหมือนกินอยู่ที่ไทยเลยค่ะ"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN0xTSkd3EAE,Mookata Lor!,5,"We were stuck at Toa Payoh Industrial Park due to sudden heavy rain so decided to have dinner at nearby coffeeshop. Surprised by the many stalls still open at this hour in this area; we decided to have mookata since perfect weather to eat something hot. Wow!!! No regrets! Not only the seafood was fresh, everything was tasty. More importantly, I don't feel thirsty. Best experience was the stall owner cook and guide us when I asked him how and what I should cook first as I've never tried mookata. Despite the heavy rain, it was a perfect evening with great discovery, yummy Mookata Lor!!! I will definitely be back again. 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbllDUV93RRAB,Mookata Lor!,5,"Soup is yummy. Meat is well marinated. Prawn is fresh, scallop is big and delicious. Overall is good. Worth the try. Will definitely come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOFlTM3lRRRAB,Mookata Lor!,4,"Ordered the set for 4 which is about $40+
The meats are well marinated but I find the greens are lacking but add a veg set ard $4+.
The condiments are standard.
The setup is in coffeeshop in the light industrial area vicinity. There are many stalls to add on to mookata. I liked the vibes due to the music and the young crowd.
However not all the fans are working so try to find near it or else you find yourself perspiring while eating mookata"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenZ5bkpBEAE,Mookata Lor!,4,Nice food with good dipping sauces but setting in an industrial park canteen or food centre is not very condusive as it gets pretty hot & sweaty which is actually how it should be but may not be very well received by people here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNGFmR0NBEAE,Mookata Lor!,5,"The meat here is AMAZING!!! So well marinated and tender. The mookata here is so affordable and came to about $10/pax and I ate till I was so full. In terms of value for money, taste and service speed, its a full 5 stars. In fact, the only reason why I dont have a photo is because the food was so delicious everything was gone in my tummy alr haha"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzh1YzZ3RRAB,Mookata Lor!,5,"This is almost the best mookata I have ever had!
Food is fresh, marination is awesome, service is great and most important thing is chilli 一级棒!
Their boss only serve the best quality of food!
And I have to say their staff super friendly!
What’s most important?
The bill is super pocket friendly also.
This is a must try and to die for mookata!
👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOGJLVkJREAE,Mookata Lor!,5,"Was cycling casually with buddies till we were so hungry, we decided to stop for food at this industrial coffee shop. After reckying all the fancies big signboard, we decided to settle with this Smallest signboard that says “Mookata Lor” since we havnt had Mookata for quite awhile. And also like their “Singlish Thai” signboard name.

And tell you what.. Their ingredients had caught me by surprise.

- Their Prawns & Scallops were so fresh, so fresh like it’s straight from the sea. Giant Scallop were bigger than our old sg 50 cents coin.

- I personally do not like pork alot due to the pork smell but trust me, I had so much pork than I could imagine here.

- Chicken were well marinated & savory. Tender & Juicy.

- Beef is Goooood. I cant have enough of it. OMG I’m hungry again writing this review.

- Soup base was FANTASTIC. Well broth with tint of sweetness. Unlike many stalls we went, starts with plain water.

- Mookata cant go without condiments. They provides 3 different type of dips or you could create your own.
Thai dip is good, goes well with everything. Traditional mince garlic chilli padi with parsley, my favourite. Another was abit sweet, mild spicy perfect for non spicy takers. Gosh, spoilt for choices.

- Last thing I would like to emphasis is the price. All 3 of us had satisfied tummies at just less than 50 dollars.

We had a GREAT time GREAT meal at Mookata Lor yesterday evening. I had it pinned and will DEFINITELY visit again. A GEM we accidentally found.

Dont wait. Bring your whole family there now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aEpfekhREAE,Mookata Lor!,5,"Great place to eat at, owners are extremely friendly and would constant check on you and engage in some light hearted conversation with you!,  food are budget friendly with a 1KG Meat platter and add on of several other ala carte dishes came to a cost of 45 for a group of 4, definitely worth it! Food was fresh and marinated deliciously, been coming back every month to support them. Can't wait to go back again ahah."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d0xfaEJBEAE,Mookata Lor!,5,"They kindly friendly, the food very nice….the most is garlic pork belly slice, that is the most nice and delicious. I will provide bring a lot friend come to eat…try support them"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcW9lcG93RRAB,Mookata Lor!,5,"Definitely a worth a visit to Mookata Lor! The ingredients especially the meat were of good quality and really well seasoned. And can i say, the soup was amazing, its the first time that I did not add the maggi seasoning into the soup as the soup base on its own tasted so good I did not want to ruin it. Furthermore, everything is very affordable and I do seeing myself making frequent trips to my new mookata hideout!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc2NidDd3RRAB,Mookata Lor!,5,wonderful meal. first time enjoying mookata. The season meat plus d premium beef is superb. Chili is spicy enough. thumbs up

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa04yeWlnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"A no-frills but delicious and fresh meat Mookata place in a Toa Payoh kopitiam.  We realised that the meats were really fresh as they were not heavily marinated (to cover up using old meat) like some other places.  Loved the pork belly slices, the garlic pork collar and the streaky pork bacon.  However, the star of the show was their signature chilli sauce!  Would be great if this place could open until later as sometimes we love a good late night Mookata meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc3MtOUNREAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"-The food was fresh, and atmosphere was nice after dark. Handmade red chili, garlic sauce was excellent, in harmony with every other food.
-The staffs were not so kind. Long queue but you can make reservation. They have a time limit of 90minutes eating.
>>It’s located in hawker center where you can enjoy your saturday night at one place. How about eating Mookata as the first round and then moving to Tiger beer stall that is close to by for the second round?😂"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOXJhck9REAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,3,"Personally felt this place was great, food and staff were amazing. But the killer was the extremely tight spacing between guests, led to space issues and particular group beside me kept looking over when their space felt threatened. Generally just bad environment and experience but food saved it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpcWVEd3JRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"Very crowded, we did the right thing to book in advance forces Sunday. It was full house.
The marinate meat were nice. Service staffs were attentive and fast. Good and spicy chilli with choice of non spicy dip too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcU1QUmhBRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Excellent packages, food is very tasty also!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLM3NyOWN3EAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"This mookata is quite obscure unless you're familiar with the neighbourhood. Once I was there, it was not obvious that there was a waiting line unless you ask the staff and the wait was quite long almost an hour. The wait was worth it as the food was really flavourful. There is a hawker beside which you can fuel up a little while waiting too. There were 5 of us and each of us paid about $10 excluding the drinks which was a really good deal. Not a lot of drinks selection though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcEthUW5RRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,Authentic Mookata meal in Toa Payoh. The price is pretty cheap for the volume we get. The ingredients are fresh and served really fast.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdmREbEZnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"We were served pretty quickly despite the place being crowded. The food variety is ok. Lotsa meat and my children love the garlic chicken. We ordered at least 20 plates of meats, Vegs and instant noodle for 4 of us and the bill came to only $38. We were very full by then. Will definitely go back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdm9tclpnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,1 of my fav place with BBQ & beer beer
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVajdlMDdRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"This place is very crowded on weekends, especially at night. Expect to wait for 30min before finding a seat. Bookings can only be made for groups more than 10 people. The garlic chicken was our favorite dish and the beef was surprisingly tender. Paid about $13 per person."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4N2JTb0V3EAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,Good place to eat mookata. Very airy and ample wind that makes you not feel hot. Come early as it gets pack very fast. Price is decent too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeXItcTVRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"have been to three of their outlets, I prefer this outlet more as the environment is more spacious, feel less claustrophobic. food is good and affordable. well ventilated!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDek9LYkZREAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"They stand out for their tasty marinated pork. Go for both the marinated and garlic, won’t go wrong!

Only issue is the queue at dinner times and the smell that accompanies you after the meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb056bjRRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,for hawker/coffeeshop is ok. value not that bad. but I feel seating slightly cramped as the tables and benches are fixed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHZmZTJnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"A casual, friendly and cosy place for Thai steamboat aka Mookata. It gives a true blue heartlander experience within a coffee shop yet keeping up with the trends. Very affordable at $22 nett for a set for 2 pax excluding drinks. Ala carte option available.

Love the al fresco ambience even when it's bustling with people enjoying the food with family and friends. A perfect get-together spot.

Mookata is essentially a hot plate BBQ plus a ring of boiling chicken soup stock around it so you get to enjoy the best of both worlds. Grill your meat with the pork fat given, and boil your vegetables in the tasty soup that has no MSG. Then, dip your grilled meat into their homemade spicy chilli-and-garlic sauce. Heavenly! I could eat this all night.

If you need more food, simply add on other dishes at only $1.90 to $2.40 nett. The boss goes around chatting with patrons, and he does seem like he loves what he is doing.

Icing on the cake would be the quality draft German beers the coffee shop owner sells right beside. It complements the mookata perfectly.

Will definitely be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpN2NTMFlREAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"The best mookata in town .Meat and seafood amd vegetables is fresh.Highly recommend the marinated pork belly and garlic pork/chicken, its tasty .The spicy chilli sauce the best!!👍🏻
Reasonable price and friendly staff. Always crowded and quite long wait but its worth it!! Recommended !!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNW95WXdBRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,1,"Staff had the audacity to chase me off because he wanted to go home. We still had a pan full of chicken meat and he walked up to us with his hand gesturing he is keeping the pan right now. Was utterly disgusted by this service provided by them. Thank you for the unpleasant evening. To the people out there, there are many other mookata places with fantastic services compared to them."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaXR6Skx3EAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Had to wait for around 45 mins for seats as we came during the peak hour but the staff timely called us when our seats were ready.

The meats were marinated well and the vegetables tasted very fresh. Their pork collar and garlic chicken were by far the best tasting ones out of those that we ordered. It was also fairly affordable and ended up costing around $10 - 15 per pax.

Throughout our experience, the service staff there were very attentive and quick. They kept our tables clear from finished dishes and even offered to change our hot plate when he saw it was very used. Generally felt that they were rather warm and genuine as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdmJMaGNnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"Well, it's a mixed rating. Food was good and super cheap!!! 6 of us full grown adults, all the meat and seafood etc it only cost us $118.80!! Amazing! I think cheaper than supermarket and cooking at home!! I downside, this branch has no Aircon. Some people like it but i do prefer if they have AC and a super strong suction ventilator. Overall happy.. HAPPY CAMPER!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycG9uY0lBEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"Great place to hang at the right time. Peak hours could get you to wait for 3 hours..
Good service, good food"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndjhxYWtnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"I love this Mookataaaa! Would say this is the most wallet friendly mookata store in Singapore. Meat were well seasoned and its so tasty. Can't stop craving for their galic chicken/pork. 10 pax is only about $150 when we ate so much! However if you go there without reservation, please be prepared to queue for quite sometime. Will strongly recommend this store! 10/10"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM19tdHFRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,Very nice food the chill is the charm. Must try. Price is really affordable 😉 if know what I mean
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtanQtOU1BEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Affordable, great service. Now taking groups of 5. However, no reservations are allowed. You can have beer at the same coffeeshop while waiting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MGVHSzZnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,1,"Food are not fresh but if you just want to eat and gather cheaply, this is the place. I stopped going after the manager is cheapo and refuse to change a plate for me. Yes sure, you need to count the washing plates to earn more.   You lose your customers who visits you every other day within the week.  But it’s ok, many people still will eat at your place, you won’t close shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0Ny1uRFJnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,Would have given a 5 star but some of the staff were quite rude. Inexpensive and the meat was well marinated.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDclBIYTd3RRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"mookata now opens at 12pm on all days

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaXIzbV9nRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Crowded on a Friday evening as usual. Lots of diners who did not make reservations had to wait.

Prices were reasonable. Food items were as fresh as can be. Service was good with empty plates cleared regularly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1BTR3p3RRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,My favorite place for Mookata. The place is getting packed recently and I had to queue for more than an hour to get a table. No reservations allowed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLWRYUnpBRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,Money worth it. Can add on more side with reasonable price. 5-11pm so better make a reservation if not long waiting list Esp weekend. 2 choices of sauces are match with soup and BBQ. Must try if you are the Mookata lovers.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUlYR1pREAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,Good pricing and tasty food...👍👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbmN5TTBnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,1,Management was bad we waited for 2hrs plus and they told us there were no seats but we saw them giving the seats to other people 😡Also before we when there we called and asked if we could book in advance they say it wasn’t allow rly bad management😡
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5djVtMXVBRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"Mookata usually not my go to food but this place serve good quality ingredients for mookata with choice of a nice spicy or a sweet dipping sauce. Best of all, you won't break the bank even if you order the whole menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcXF2RTBRRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,2,"Didn’t took photo as waited too long And very hungry...
Maybe because I have tried other stall that suit my taste more.. a bit disappointed.
Soup is ok. The pan doesn’t stick at all, price very cheap compare to other place.
So that all for the 2 star.
Marinated meat don’t suit my taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeXVXUmJBEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,Food nice & cheap high recommend
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4eTV5NlhnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"It was really value for money. For $22 a set for 2, you get 2 medium size prawns, some squid, pork belly, chicken, pork, 4 scallops, enoki mushrooms, cabbages, xiao bai chai, corn, wong pok and an egg. We did not order rice or noodles because the amount is perfect. The thai dip is superb and spicy too. Our first time there but definitely will make many return trips there. We call in advance but was told no more reservations were alot. Staff told us we can do a walk in. We went there at 9.45pm and got a table immediately. Best to avoid dinner time. Last order is at 11.30pm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb04tTHF3RRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Great place for Thai mookata (bbq). Inexpensive and meat are well marinated. If local Thais choose to satisfy their mookata craving here rather than golden mile, you can be assured of the quality. Just be warned that long queues are expected on Fridays and weekends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMGUyYnpnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,"Pretty positive experience, staff were friendly and food quantity was fair and sufficient in my opinion. Pricing is reasonable too. Overall it is recommended, but not 5 stars because there was nothing special about it; other than it being a place for mookata. Also, take note that they only except cash."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDZzVDZkh3EAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"It's great. Had a perfect time there with delicious food. Although, it is located in a Kopitiam or Coffee Shop so it is not some fancy air conditioned restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNXJTQlRnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,4,Nice ambiance to enjoy mookata.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MThiMWNnEAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,Loved the outdoor atmosphere! Very friendly husband wife owners. Taught us how to cook Mukata well. Thank you very much. Will definitely come back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMnRDUTB3RRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,2nd time coming here. The customer service is superb but their food marination standard has dropped alittle. Will definitely be back due to their friendly approach. Keep it up! 👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaGVpLVl3EAE,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,"Bangkok Street mookata is probably one of the better places to eat mookata, the prices are quite cheap with less than $15 to $20 per person. The place is quite packed, I suggest coming earlier to book a seat as it can take anywhere between 30 mins to 1 hour for a seat depending on group size.

The portion for food is generous and good and for the large eaters, don't worry, you will be full. I have gone several times and it is always filling"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOHJHdHhnRRAB,Bangkok Street Mookata - Lor 8 Toa Payoh,5,Affordable and yummy! Remember to make reservation before hand
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbVBfZS1RRRAB,@Thai Station 42,5,"If you're a Thai food lover then I urge you to not missed out this authentic Thai food stall that is hidden right in the heart of toa payoh central. I have seen this stall around recently as it was opened not long ago after covid period. I think around May if I'm not wrong? The main chef is from Thailand so please be assured you're getting real authentic Thai food! This stall is located right in J99 coffeeshop together my favourite chicken rice stall... I have been eating chicken rice all along and haven't been able to try this Thai stall until today.

Their menu is very extensive and it all the usual Thai favourites can be found right in their menu. Their price are also super affordable and most of all, it is very very valuable for money. Basil pork goes for 5.50 and it comes with egg. You can also try out their basil prawn which is super good as well. Their prawns are not those small little shrimps as they used medium prawns which are fresh and crunchy.

The aunties here are also super friendly and courteous so don't be afraid to ask for their recommendations if you're a first timer like me. I will be back again to try their other dishes such as phad Thai and Tom yum soup. Hope they will survive in the long run as this stall is quite small and if you don't look around carefully, you might missed their stall as there are quite a nunber of stall in this coffeeshop."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleE12RmhnRRAB,@Thai Station 42,5,"Decent portion for $5.50 basil pork rice with egg.

Saw others ordering garlic pork which looks good with the fried garlic bits too. May try it next time!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb05uVHdRRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,"Went on a sat afternoon and it was quite busy but had many empty seats due to the rather large area. Feels like they might be a little short on staff with only 1-2 waiters that are always tending to someone, but still gets the job done rather quickly. Overall a rather satisfying meal, though the food is a little on the saltier side. Nice air conditioned cosy environment"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyel9tMExREAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Air-condition restaurant. Place is clean and new, floor abit slippery but okay. The waiter are kinda attentive, even though they are very busy. If you having a la cart meal, do check if the servings are correct, they might missed one or two. Overall experience is good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdmY3V01nEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"This is my first time to try Toa payoh branch. Food are unexpectedly yummy!! Especially pork meat 三層肉 was well marinated 👍
You can choose to go Ala-cart or buffet, but I advise can go for ala- cart, unless you are super big eater😅
They serve ice cream too! You can just take by urself, that was so generous, but for ala cart can just go for one cup and $2 from 2nd cup onwards. Buffet is unlimited!
6 of us was just spent $101.81 in total! So cheap! Definitely will visit again ☺️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHODRqNDRnRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,"1st time here, on a Sunday evening.
Pretty big place but still got filled up.
They have buffet and ala carte and we went for buffet.

They do missed out an item or 2 of our orders. But not an issue, just reorder it anyway they serve the foods very promptly.

Don't forget the smooth texture ice cream before u leave; must-have items. Hahaha"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dnA2OGxnRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,"We are here as it was raining and it felt like a perfect time for thai hotpot hahaha. Reminds me of the good old days at marina south Zhengfa.

Not much to gush about, normal fare. Good crowd for a rainy day ☺️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1lLNlpBEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Food is good as always. Must pick thai sausage, fake abalone slice, and seaweed for the soup. Would be so much better and comfortable if the cleanliness can be done better. Will still come back again for the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OTktak1nEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"This is the toa payoh central outlet. Clean, cooling environment, food is well marinated, fresh and tasty, and the service by the Thai waiting staff were warm and awesome. I would recommend that you guy provide tongs to bbq the meat. One can expect to spend around $70++ for 2 pax if you opt for the canned oolong drinks as well. Oh and they use gas instead of charcoal…which tastes slightly different from traditional charcoal mookata but still very good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdjRtRU1BEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Had been here a few times before deciding to drop a review for them.
The place is clean and well ventilated !

Most of the time we are here on weekend afternoon, slightly less crowded compare to night timing. There's aircon, so no issue even if you crave for mooks during lunch ~ Be sure to drink more water mannnnnn~

Staffs are friendly, but tends to get a little busy. So do give them more time for the preparation of your orders, or additional orders.

There's two type of choice for this mooks i believe. Buffet Style or Ala-Carte.

Most of the time, we will opt for Ala-Carte. Each plate range starting from $2.00 , if i didnt remember wrongly. On the pricey side, but for the location & air-con , acceptable la.

Love their minced pork & bacon cheese ~ The rest are good too, but personally skip black pepper, too heavy for me. But teriyaki pork belly is great !

There's also FOC ice cream for you, just help yourself to it.
Great fix for midnight cravings, open till 2am .

One pointers for all customers, do take note yourself on what you have ordered and no. of orders. Although as the usual practice, at most mooks, they will combine your no. of quantity into the same plate/bowl, sometimes there's still a few missed/overlooked orders. So if in any doubts do ask them, they are nice people so dont worry. At times, it happens to be a missed for our favourite meat, so we tend to realise.. Hahah, else i think its easy to overlook for everyone, too much selections too much orders. Just whack all the meat ! Hahah."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtXzRfalhBEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,"Decent mookata in the neighbourhood, price is affordable, $70+ for 4pax for ala carte. The cheese dip is a must get and the smoked duck too! Free flow ice cream too, the sauces are decent too. A nice place to satisfy ur cravings"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjhickdnEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,"First time visit here on weekday, food was tasty especially the sauces, if u like spicy, this is the best place to try it, price is affordable."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPazRQdEdREAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,5,Many choice of food to select. Love their teriyaki pork belly n chicken. Only that sometimes miss out order and need to ask again. Usually I pay using favepay n get rebate for my nxt visit but this month I came no more favepay.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2NzdTT2tRRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Went there with family on 15 Sept for mookata. Food is not bad as usual though the ventilation there is slightly poor. I would recommend you to wear your most unpopular clothes there.
Special shout out to cheese bacon wraps, smoke duck , pork belly and basically all e meat haha.

The ice cream will be a good ending after dinner. Self service and you can grab a huge portion for urself. Additional to mention that the service stuff is amazing. Friendly and helpful. Feels like you are dining in Bangkok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcktPRUxnEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,3,"Came here more than 5 times but every single time, there will be extra 2-3 items added to our bill. It’s hard for us to remember every single item we ordered but we always order 10 items but somehow the receipt shows 13 items. At this point, it’s hard to believe that it is an honest mistake. Food is great but doubt I’ll continue to support. Service wasn’t great today; all male staffs and it is obvious that the they all seemed pretty confused. Still prefer the usual female staffs who are fast and efficient and always get the orders right."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNE1mU2p3RRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Went in at around 5pm, there were not many people so maybe there is no time limit for the mookata. I was allowed to eat the buffet until 7+pm with my family. Even though there were only 2 or 3 waiters, we were serviced really promptly and kindly. Overall a pleasant experience. The food is slightly savoury and salty and has a very large variety of meat to choose from ( ranging from pork belly/slices/neck to lamb and fish)

However, the seats and space in the restaurant is slightly too narrow and squeezy, especially during busy hours at around 6pm onwards."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyazZPWU9REAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,First time visited this restaurant. Affordable price and spacious. Fast service and good for enjoying good time with friends.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeTdQb3pnRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,1,"Horrible Midnight experience whereby the Indian staffs are just bad at communication with customers and plainly just interested in sitting down with their mobiles than working. Management also didn’t give two hoots about running the place properly and just sitting around.

Ordered twice on the menu with several items and no updates on item that are unavailable. Had to take 3 staff to update me on closing timing

Staff constantly crowding over table when it’s near closing to pressure us to finish up quickly when no proper handover on what time they’re really closing. Everything was estimated.

Billing was horrible where items are just listed on how many quantities of the price tag we took which we can’t tally if the item is there on the table or just added randomly. Bill is not shocking but could use more work to let customers understand what is charged

Been to different outlets and also this outlet in other timing but never had this horrible experience even when it’s super shorthanded. Makes me think twice on whether I’m gonna patronise there as a fellow F&B server"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGU3TUhnEAE,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,1,"Not wanting to give a one star rating due to its facility being well ventilated and clean but the service must improve in order to prevent a future incident happening.

1) burner cooks slow that my table was seated for 3 hours in there.

2) we ordered buffet set but because we sat for 3 hours we could not order any more than we wanted.

3) we asked for another set of burner but was declined to unknown reasons.

4) we asked if we could change the buffet set to ala-carte but was also rejected as it was too late to do so?

5) we had 3 people sharing 1 burner but we spent 3 hours in there but did not even finish cooking our one and only order of meat.

6) if the Thomson outlet could change my ala-carte order to buffet because of their technical issues im sure the toa payoh outlet could do so too.

7) i spent $104 for 3 people ordering only $50+ worth of meat.

This is unfair as we could not order anything more due to the time and also the burner not being able to cook fast nor being able to open a new burner due to the manager saying so."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z2IzbGtRRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Pretty decent food and prices. Very good and quick service.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLejR5aDdBRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"Good choice for mookata due to...
Environment: Inside with aircond so won't hot and the smoke exhaust did the job. But definitely you clothes still smell smoky after that.
Food: minimum order of 10plate (exclude rice/noodles), most of the meat we order is tasty, soup refillable. Just nice for 2pax as we are small eater.
Sauce must try: go for special with add on garlic, chili, and lime juice.
Service: Fast, waiter are attentive.
Price: ~$30 for the one shown in photo (10plate+1rice). Depends what you order, range start from $1.80 (vege), $2 (Meat)~$4(special/seafood)."

Food is tasty, it's air-conditioned, prices are reasonable. But to be expected, it was massively overcrowded when we visited on a Saturday night--staff was running around all over the place trying to handle orders, customers were getting impatient, etc. We also ended up with stomach aches the day after, so can't say much about food hygiene. First and last visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOGR5eG13RRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,1,"First and the last time dining here, service is awfully bad, staffs are not attentive although not much diners at that point of time.

Staffs are having lunch together and talking happily disregarding the customers in the vicinity. Nothing wrong to have lunch but I suggest having lunch at different timing rather than having lunch altogether.

Rice also tasted sour, almost feels like mayonnaise with rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPek9PRy1RRRAB,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,1,"the worst mkt in sg. (only this outlet)

Told the chinese auntie and missed item didn't come and had to prompt again.

Upon serving all of the food, one of the male staff (a little big size) came over and told us if we would like to change to buffet instead as it would be much more worth it. We're glad that the staff was kind enough to inform us.

Would definitely go back again."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdHNlNmt3RRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Had the premium set dinner for 2 pax. The crispy papaya salad was nice, and crispy of course.
The steam fish was fresh, and a big slice of fish! Tom Yam Creamy soup was great too.
And choose 1 meat dish. We chose basil pork. Was nice, but I was too full to eat. Had it takeaway instead.

I ordered Thai milk tea but decided to add pearl. Staff gladly changed for me. Very good service. The drinks are served in takeaway containers and sealed with the machine to avoid spillage.

Overall nice restaurant, would come back again for sure!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMU8zZGVREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"I visited this eatery for dinner on a weekend and I must say that it was crowded. So I would advise that you make a reservation first before heading down or you will spend some time waiting. Overall customer service is good, the staff that attended to us was polite and gave good recommendations for the dishes and beverages. Ambiance wise, it was okay, comfortable enough to enjoy your meals. I ordered fresh oysters and they were awesome! A little salty but thick. You have to try it, words cannot tell how good that is. Their meat platter is another. Succulent and grilled to the right texture. Again you have to try it yourself, I really cannot find any words to describe it. Price, is rather affordable in opinion but worth the money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMkxXMk1BEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,Very high quality food yet friendly on the wallet. We ordered the 4 pax meal and have no more space for the oysters. Will come back again to try the Japanese oysters. Happy hour rate at only $2 per oyster. Staff are very friendly and willing to accommodate. Kudos to Jeremy for the good hosting!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXFIWWVREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"First visit as recommended by a friend. Atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable. Ordered few dishes, fried sea bass and clay pot glass noodle is a must try. Even the Thai milk tea was almost identical to Thailand standard, make me feel like I’m in Bangkok.
Service was excellent as if you are in the land of Smiles.
Overall this place is strongly recommended."

Overall most of the dishes were pretty yummy and portion was good for 5! We ordered 3 rice/noodles, a meat and a side. Big eaters might want to order a little more! The ambience was nice and we saw that the menu has sashimi and oysters as well hence it's more a fusion restaurant. Friendly staff and service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3FxSVRBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Very satisfying meal. Not disappointed after multiple visits. Always up to expectation. Very good to satisfy cravings for Thai food in the neighbourhood.

Highly recommend crispy papaya salad which elevates the usual papaya salad into something fun and indulgent, not usually found on menus. Great as a starter and adds a lot of crunch texture to your meal. Also recommend Tofu hot plate which comes with egg tofu, egg and some meat and seafood with comes sizzling hot. Great with rice.
Standard basil pork/chicken always consistent. Tom Saap hits all the spot for spicy Tom yum craving. Great balance or sourness and savouriness.

Love to end with my favourite red Ruby dessert. They usually serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for added creaminess."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOGREakhnEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by a staff, Thai. She was very smiley and friendly. The ambience was very soothing with Thai songs playing in the background. After looking at the wide variety of dishes on the menu, we decided to order the set menu for 4. The food was really good and well presented on the plates. I especially like the Thai milk tea and would bring my family and friends to try their food again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGJuaUx3EAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Chanced upon this thai food restaurant and decided to give it a try, the food tastes so authentic and the time that took the food to be served is almost immediate! The staffs there were super nice and pay great attention to our needs! I will come back to try more food on the menu! 👍🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMXVtYWZBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Great Thai food. All the flavors are spot on. Fairly priced, delicious, and such friendly and accommodating staff. Highly recommend. Try the papaya salad, pork cheek, tom yum, heck - everything is great. Love the oyster and Prosecco for $11 on Friday. Super promo."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbktHZllREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Had the premium set for 2 for lunch. Food was amazing, with the signature crispy papaya salad as the greatest highlight for lunch! Will definitely come back and try their crispy papaya salad with soft shell crab. Amazing service as well, as our needs/well-being/quality of food was checked on by the service crew."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcExLT01nEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"First of all, the staff is very friendly. It was full house when I visit during dinner time as I didn’t make reservation but the staff still service me well to sit outside and introduce me their menu.
I ordered the premium dinner set for 2pax, food is good and appetizing and I think can serve up to 3 pax for the portion so it is totally worth with $39.90. I take away the papaya salad which doesn’t show in my picture as we can’t finish and it taste good too.
Will definitely visit again to try something else in the menu.
Is a nice neighborhood Thai restaurant worth visit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX04zMndnRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"An excellent Thai restaurant with an equally efficient staff.
Real authentic Thai food at a reasonable price.
Food quality was fresh & great .
Montark service was prompt & she would explain the menu to the uninitiated explaining how the dish is cooked.
I would highly recommend this place 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa2NPSHFRRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Wide varieties of Thai food selections. Nice ambience with aircon. They sell liquor too.
Mixed meat platter is mooping, lemongrass chicken and grilled pork neck.
Seabass with garlic is not tough.
Fried papaya salad with soft shell crab is special.
Fried omelette with crab meat is very flavourful.
We should have order some non fried dishes to balance the meal.
A place worth visiting. They have points accumulation system so make sure you order through qr code to have the points accumulation. We wasn't told and order taken down by waitress but boss Jeremy is good to offer he will settle it backend for us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybjhueGd3RRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,One of the BEST Thai Food in SG. Good and reasonable price premium set meal. Their ala cart menu is also good too. They serve Fried Papaya Salad - pretty special. The Seafood Chilli sauce is also very nice. Their staff is friendly especially Ice is very friendly and open for conversation. We will definitely return to try more of their Thai delicacies.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OTlfNTZ3RRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Affordable, delicious and very authentic tasting thai food. Restaurant was clean and well air-conditioned. Great place to grab a bite and chill. Loved their recommended drunken noodle which was spicy. Fortunately, me and my wife love spicy food. Their pineapple fried rice was bursting with flavour too. I'll definitely come back for more."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeUxYQWt3RRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,4,Authentic Thai food. Good atmosphere. Spice kick is good. Thai ice tea is one of the best I've tried.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN0pydm5nRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,4,Reasonable prices great food. Pleasant environment for a Thai food. Dinner time could be quite crowded.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbV9xSFhBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Thai food is known for being one of the popular food in Singapore. There are a bunch of Thai restaurants in here, but if you want to have some of the best Thai food available in Singapore, then you should go to Super Thai By Soi Aroy. The food is great and the price is reasonable. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out some authentic Thai food!

👍🏽 Grilled Pork Cheeks - must order! Nicely torched and tenderness of the meat.

👍🏽 Premium Tom Yum Soup

👍🏽 Red Ruby - must order! Sweetness is just nice and the awesome taste of the milk. Most delicious red ruby dessert ever!

👍🏽Aurora Cooler - must order! Very special nice drink. Butterfly pea flower tea with lime juice. The pea flower gives a very fragrant taste to the drink unlike normal lime juice.

Prices are reasonable and portion are huge too.
Must try the Papaya Salad and Pork Cheeks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMUxQeVdREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Wonderful Thai food and very friendly staff and service! The oysters were fresh and yummy. We also ordered grilled pork, steamed sea bass and pork trotters. All were good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1anZUMFJ3EAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"We came near closing and were welcome in.

Tonight dinning is fantastic, great service and delicious food but wondering if msg was a little over as We felt really thirsty after the meal

Parking
You can park inside Macpherson mall n walk over.

Will we be back?
Yes!  Food is nicer,  we just have to drink more water!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ1BTYVh3EAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Recently visit and I must say if you want authentic Thai food to satisfy Thai food craving, here is the place! I highly recommend here and I love their quality dishes are all at affordable price plus the staffs are very friendly.

What I have,

Soi Aroy Signature Mixed Platter.
Comes with Moo Ping (pork skewers), Lemongrass Chicken and Grilled Pork Cheeks that are marinated for 24 hours. Once served the staff will torch the pork cheek on the spot to give that smokiness and melt in mouth goodness once you bite on while the lemongrass chicken and mooping are grilled to tender perfection.

Crispy Papaya Salad with deep fried soft shell crab!! This dish was probably the most unique out of all the dishes tried. A unique rendition of the familiar papaya salad that been battered and deep fried till crispy and atop deep fried soft shell crab. Have it together with the tangy and nutty dipping sauce, I'm in heaven.

Crispy Omelette With Crab Meat.
This is another of the stand-out dishes to me.
The fried egg is not only airy and fluffy, but very crispy and not being in any way greasy as well. The added crab meat atop, adds a distinct note of crustacean sweetness to the omelette and the crab meat itself is fresh.

Thai Steamed Seabass with Lime & Chilli.
Ocean fresh Seabass steamed in special lime and chilli sauce topped with SuperThai special sauce. I like you can opt for fish fillet or the entire seabass. Fresh, tender meat paired with the spicy sauce that keeps me eating non stop.

Seafood Tom Yum Soup.
It blew me away with its depth and bold flavours. Sour and spicy which goes perfectly with rice and the seafood is really fresh here.

Claypot Vermicelli with Prawns.
The prawns are fresh and succulent and the vermicelli is bursting with flavour from having absorbed the sauce. Pack a flavourful punch.

Fresh Oyster.
I'm very lucky that I went day they have fresh oyster and is so fresh when you dip with their sauce, you in ocean heaven!

Mango Sticky Rice.
Hard to give this Thai dessert amiss. I love this as it has the perfect firmness and sweetness of the Thai Mango thay went perfectly well with the perfect texture of the glutinous rice and coconut milk. This dessert is highly commendable.

Red Ruby with Coconut Icecream.
Coconut Icecream on top shaved ice, drizzled with sweet red syrup and fresh coconut milk. Topped with red rubies that gives a chewy crunch.

The Thai Iced Tea here is a must DRINK. Not too sweet yet strong enough taste of the tea aroma.

A place worth keep coming back to.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc2VlelVnEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"We ordered the prosperity set menu for our reunion dinner.
Food is prepared rather fast and ingredients are fresh.
We have a satisfactory meal as all the dishes are palatable and tasty.
We definitely be back for more meals in the near future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyei1ua2pRRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,4,"Overall it was a happy & very pleasant experience dining here!

Good job on the attentive & personable service by the team.

Enjoyed mooping, pork belly, mixed vegetables, pineapple rice, olive rice and mango sticky rice. My family members love the spicy lala, tom yum soup etc. I don’t take any spice so will have to take their words for it.

Ordered many dishes, too hungry to capture all snaps:)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX1BERmNBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,4,"Ordered the Tom yam glass noodle soup. The soup is rich and nice but too bad they only have glass noodles.

Find the Thai ice tea so so only so can skip.

The price is not too expensive so recommend to try. Not much parking so need to park at nearby hdb instead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPXzdUN1ZREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,4,"Delicious food .  Large portion of rice being served  , so you dont have to ask for  extra rice . Friendly lady staff asked - whether we need  extra soup or not ?  I Said ,”No”at the beginning but end up  finishing  all and have to  request again . Fish soup was full of Flavour 👌👌."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcVAtamVREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Good foods. Authentic Thai food. I enjoyed the food here and friendly staffs recommending the options and food serving as well.

Not so crowded for the store. The parking was quite full in the front on the store.

Price wise was ok.

Came again second time, ordered different dishes from the first one. They were delicious. The staff, same thing, was friendly. Green curry with the Thai omelet were good combination. Prawn was good as well,  easy to peel even with cutlery."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1al91QWhnRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Authentic, affrodable and memorable Thai food worth coming back for. Many book reserve a table in advance. Had the two person set which includes Kang Kong, Fish Cake and Squid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHJMWFdBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Service by Miss Tai is super friendly and welcoming. Food is excellent, even better than some famous Thai restaurant here and Bangkok. Must try the Prawn Vermicelli, Pork Platter and Fried Fish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXanN2T0dnEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,We decided to try this restaurant and was overwhelmed by the wonderful Thai experience. It brings back wonderful memories of BKK. 😍 I  will definitely recommend friends to drop by and try.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPamQ3RUVBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,Yummy Thai food. Added extra dishes on top of the premium value set. Total bill about 130 for 5 pax.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdkkzS1pnEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Impressive menu with authentic taste. Service crew is overwhelmed but kudos to floor manager Vincent who will make it enjoyable. Tom yum going is super fresh, soup emphases the fresh seafood on its broth. Fried fish comes with killer chilli sauce mixed with fresh veg

Top fab and fav: unanimously the prawns tang Hoon. Takes in the wok Hei flavour from the claypot . Prawns are of large size and till just right. Crunchy and not overcooked.

Had some good oysters paired with Prosecco. Overall great experience . Just a tad too loud and noisy. Probably all patrons too excited about the food fed to them

U Should give it a try. Moo Ping ( pork chop skewers are a must."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eDdMRldBEAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Great place, excellent food! I was quite surprise that with such delicious Thai food, there wasn’t a crowd!

This is my second time visiting this place. They have different level of spiciness; local, Thai and super Thai. I went with the local version. Unlike many Thai food restaurants, their flavour will change with the spice level but this one maintains the flavour irregardless of the spice level.

The only downside is the fish. Tried twice based on different cooking style I guess they have still some rooms for improvement. Mind you, the fish is fresh and soft but I prefer it abit more crispy (deep fried fish fillet) and prefer a stronger flavour for chilli and lime fillet. Oh yes, you can choose either to order whole fish or fillet which many stalls doesn’t give this option.

I would still go back and try many of their other dishes because price for the food quality is a steal. Plus don’t have to queue to get a seat :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNy1XN0VREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,Great food great ambience. The food are tasty and delicious that we foresee we will visit here again! Service was excellent also. Highly recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azlyekx3EAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,3,"Let me just quickly state that parking is going to be a pain. We had to park at the nearby HDB estate and walk over.

We had the prawn claypot with glass noodles which was slightly disappointing as there was no burnt taste that you would normally associate with a claypot dish. The prawns and noodles were cooked fine.

The grilled pork cheeks were quite nice although it was 99% fats.

The prawn cakes were perfectly done, light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Easily the best dish.

Personally I prefer the outlet at sim lim but this place was quite decent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d3F2WUFREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,2,"Have not tried other dishes but pad Thai with prawns was a great disappointment. Prawns are very tiny and the texture and taste of pad Thai is not the usual flavoured ones. For the price, it is not worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMElESXJRRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,Excellent food and a very friendly and cheerful host that gave good recommendations. Very unique take on Thai food as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbGJmZEFREAE,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"Officially a fan of this place! 2nd time here and very impressed by the authentic flavours of the Thai food!

Will definitely patronise again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3VyRnRBRRAB,Super Thai by Soi Aroy,5,"I live in the neighborhood near this restaurant and there are many thai places near by. Out of all, i think this one is the best one in terms of the authenticity of food, quality of service. The staffs here are so attentive and explain to you about menu very kindly.  Super Thai is a really nice place to dine in as well as to quickly pick up (they prepare it very fast) and bring home to eat.

They also have a super value lunch sets on the weekdays,  which makes my wfh lunch time very satisfying. Their chicken wings are to die for lol.

When i have home gathering, this food never went wrong."

A shout out to new service staff Aiman for being kind, prompt and friendly when serving our table. We were really appreciative of him attending to us.

Meanwhile, appreciate if the management of Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot can look into the performance and conduct of service staff, Margaret. Throughout our 1.5 hour session dining at your restaurant, Margaret was bossing and instructing all your service crew around to clean tables, serve other tables while she herself practically contributing nothing at all for the entire duration.

When making payment, we feedbacked the above to the manager on duty. He mentioned the following
1) Prior complaints have been received against Margaret by both service crew themselves and customers.
2) Margaret is a service crew, similar to everyone else, and not a manager etc. Hence, logically, she should be taking a fair share of the workload

Hence, hope that management is able to look into the above, please."

Great service never goes out of style, thank you Shidah for keeping us as happy as our tummies! Our meal won't be the same without your friendly chatters and recommendations!

Waited 30 mins before knowing that our order was not received.

Cannot amend number of items we ordered in the webpage

Received the wrong order.

Can encounter delay during peak hours."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMFlmOTVRRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,First hotpot experience and it was great! The soups were flavourful and the service was good. Location isn’t the most convenient but I would still recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaTUzN1dBEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"Not worth paying $25.90++ and another weekend dinner surcharge of $3++ per pax and another $10.90++ for premium items but the restaurant is short handed.

You have its staff doubling between Suki-Suki Thai and Siam Kitchen and honestly, you can get something comparable somewhere else at a more affordable price."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajZhcjBBRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"Our first visit was fine, but there are limited food choices and staff issue.

However we still decided to come again, only for the Sukiyaki soup base, but we were informed that it is only a promotional item.

Please bring it back. It is so difficult to find a halal hotpot restaurant which serves Sukiyaki soup base ( because it mainly uses wine ).

Thank you"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzd2SW1nRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Nice place and nice food. Everything (soup, marinade, sauces) was the right combination of spicy, sweet, sour, salty. Can tell that they are a little short handed but it didn’t affect the food or service in any way. 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHRQc2t3RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Had a family dinner here for 10 pax. Entering the restaurant was painless after reservations made earlier.
Service - I was disappointed with the lack of attention to our table and the very slow drip of replenishment food which we had ordered through the website. Initial round of meats and other condiments served barely covered the amount of people we had in our table which resulted in each person only having a piece of meat before running out. We had to order again through the website ordering system and waited more than 20 mins for them to actually give us more food. Regrettably this only happened after I had to literally chase down a staff at the other end of the place and complain.By the way I don't blame the staff for the restaurant being clearly short handed.
Foodwise the quality given was average at best which did not match the asking price for a buffet . For reference per head we were charged SGD 35++ per adult not inclusive of an additional optional charge of SGD4.90 ++ for free flow drinks / desserts. For that price in comparison would have expected prawns to be available but this was only available if you add a further charge for premium meat/seafood. which would have brought the price up per head to SGD 50++.You could get a buffet with oysters / prawn at a hotel at that price.
In conclusion I would not recommend the restaurant at this moment due to food quality versus price asked."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NWVfM0p3EAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Not worth the price you pay. Very little choices. The price you pay for buffert does not include drinks or dessert which is not interesting at all (pay seperately). Will not come again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM01YTFZREAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Very bad experience at this outlet on a sunday night, nearly empty. Food was decent but service by this older chinese? auntie waitress, Jov was hideous. Jov was very rude and constantly staring down at us close to us from the corner. The restaurant was empty, Jov. We can see you.
When we flagged her down asking for refill or utensils, she repeatedly exclaimed shes busy. The restaurant was almost empty, about 20% full.
My previous review was longer and got removed, but my experience stands. This waitress Jov has a bad attitude."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MnMtZjhnRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Same style as suki ya but with thai flavours.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MHZlVm93RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,Place just converted to Thai Hot Pot recently.  Price is reasonable only if you have Safra member 20% discount. Soup base is better compared to previous Suki-Ya but limited choices of ingredients. Believed its Halal certified so no pork served. Service average due to insufficient manpower.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1lYVXNRRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"Not worth it all.
Food were meh, same as their sukiya outlet.
Only can order max 3 condiments out of the 5 they have.
Service really terrible from one of the female service staff. We asked for chopsticks but she says she’s busy. So we took from another table without anyone. Then she came over to scold us and said “you cannot take from here, we already lay out properly, if you want ask from me”. But we already did ask…? And she said she was busy…??? Confused by her service and action. Really not needed. She could have just replenish the chopsticks on the empty table without saying anything.

They don’t provide serviettes/tissue as well. Spoons were super dirty, didn’t dare to ask for another one cause they so fierce, I scared.

Paid ~$75 for 2 person weekend dinner. Super not worth it!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxam9udHl3RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"The staff there were very kind and helpful, especially Jov! She was super friendly and made our experience there great. She's the kind of staff that would help secure loyal customers to your restaurant. Hope she gets rewarded accordingly :)

The food here is really q good for the price you're paying, definitely worth a try if you're around the area"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dmYySzlnRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Always delightful experience! Service staff is so friendly and food is always on point!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbXZ5Y09nEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Not too busy. The soup was nice. Staff was friendly & helpful. A nice place to have dinner with friends or family.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMElfQTVBRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Nice and spacious, suitable for family.
Went with a toddler and the food was suited my toddler’s palate.

Good choices of variety of meat/ veg/ fish cakes/ mushroom.

Love the Thai soup base, had the sweet Basil chicken and Khao Soi as recommended by the staff, and it was really good.

Best service staff! Was attended by this staff Hock Seng, very attentive and he personally reccommend the soup bases to our family.

Would come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhLV92SldREAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"I would got to say this place is really a value for money if you are into eating loads and is tight on budget. They are running a promo at $35 for 2 person (Eat-all-you-can).

Try it!

The downside is that the place is severely understaffed. But the people did their best to help you as much as possible. So kudos to them! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMEp2YmJREAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Service was good, staff explained on the menu in details."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMDl5M3FnRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"This Thai hotpot located in SAFRA, currently offers 1for1 thus the price is very friendly but still can only beffet-ala ka while they have only 2 waiter/waiteress helping at the dinning area... So, from order to be served, it takes.quite some time and usually the meat plates and short to serve, order the 2nd round needs to wait for 15.mins more. However 1for1.only dine in for 9ne hour... Which makes us very uncomfortable during lunch time.
The food themselves, all the those we can buy in the supermarket, the fish paste is too moistured so after cooking, the taste is very weird..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcVpDQW53RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Good food, for the price extemely worth it.
Service was fantastic... we were kinda late yet the Jov crew maintain professional service level to serve us instead of rushing us.. I really like the different sauces that they made for us."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X09QMEh3EAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Shidah and Shariff have been wonderful while we are at Suki Suki Thai Safra Toa Payoh.
Food is fresh and tasty. Soup base was super refreshing especially Red Tom Yum. Thank you so much for the great service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bHZHZnVnRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Suki Hotpot had reasonable variety and quite authentic. Atmosphere was great with attentive staff, especially Shidah, who made us feel very warm, welcomed and very attentive to us. 😁"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcU1LbWNBEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Me and my group of friends were having dinner at suki suki Thai @ Toa Payoh on 26th March 2021. It was a Friday night and the restaurant seems pretty crowded. The staffs are especially short handed due to covid measures. Hock seng was very patience with us. He was very friendly throughout and guide us on how to order through the QR code. His service was very prompt too when we ordered the drinks. We had a very special night celebrating my friend birthday. He made the celebration even more memorable. Thanks hock seng for your service! Stay cheerful!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdU1XYkVnEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Good food, great Staffs...
We have this ""table captain"" Hock something...  Who is attentive...  My friend drop a chopsticks and bowl loudly one the floor and voila!!! He rush to us and hand up another one set and rush off to another task..

Thumbs up this the service!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX092SnNBRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"All staff with excellent service especially a guy named Shariff! I requested Thai milk tea with less ice and everytime I want to refill water, he will make sure the ice not fall into my drink."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHN3NldWNnEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Queuing system sucks. Call and ask but we aren't allowed to make reservation. Waiting outside the store for more than 45 mins. They should have a queuing system to get a queue number. No air con no chair at the waiting area. A waste of time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMEx1TmhRRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,A good place to chill and enjoy your food. A good ambience. The staff hock seng is very polite and courteous. Keep it up! Things to improve more choices of food would be good :))
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5c3R5MC13RRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Conveniently located inside TPY Safra. Staff are extremely friendly and polite, able to notice any needs you have before you even ask for it. Drinks are refilled proactively before they are empty. Food tastes really good, Sweet Basil Chicken and Red Tomyum are really worth trying, highly recommended place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbzVydVJnEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Soup base tasted like instant soup paste. Menu pricing too complicated to understand. Don't be too deceived by their advertising photos.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dXVQcnZBRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Dined here with friends and was really impressed with the service. The food was decent - but the services of the waitresses - atie- was top notch. Very helpful and attentive to our request.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OHNtaEdREAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Good experience at suki-suki Thai serve by Staff Shidah. She's very friendly and attentive. Thank you for the great service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdUpYb2ZBEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"System is not very friendly, but staff is nice to guide us. It's very nice to see a group of cheerful group helping us not so up to technology batch..

Seems abit under Staffs as they are moving up and down very quickly...

Overall, experience is great.. Jus not very good with thr phone ordering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbHRpOHVRRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"The food was delicious and the ambience was great! The staffs, especially Hock Seng, served us well and was friendly too! It was overall a nice experience 😄👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOXV1QjhRRRAB,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Gd customer service by Ms Jov and her team. The food was excellence, gd value for money. Highly recommended and will come back again. Thumbs up 👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdUlUM1pnEAE,Suki-Suki Thai Hot Pot @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,I want to respond to hock seng on the 27th. He serves very well and is very enthusiastic. This is my first visit here. Thank you for introducing the soup and food. I will come back next time. 🥰
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGFfYmx3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was, given that the store front looked rather assuming and there wasn't a snaking queue.

We ordered the set meal for 2 as we didn't want the hassle of deciding which dishes to order. The set meal came with 2 large bowls of rice, chicken, crab/fish (can't remember which) cakes and Tom yum soup. The portions were generous and is suited for a dining party of 3.

I loved the tom yum soup went very well with the rice and there was so much flavour. There were squid, fish and vegetables in the soup. The crab/fish cakes were not too oily and they went very well with the dipping sauces provided.

All in all, the meal was value for money and we'd definitely return again if we are in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbFBXT1VREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Ordered the pineapple fried rice, basil pork rice, tomyum soup. All dishes were flavourful and good! Staff is also very friendly when taking our orders, and also helped to bring the food to our table. A hidden gem in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ09uNUFREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Was recommended by a friend and I cannot stop going back.

It’s definitely a hidden gem and the thai food is bloody legit. The broth for the steamed fish was so refreshing filled with lemongrass, mushrooms and it was invigorating with every sip!

Tom yam soup is definitely one of the better ones here, it’s thick and not watery just as how it should be.

They’re generous with the size of the omelette too and to top it off, the owner is such a sweet lady."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbmZxV0pREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,"Run by a Thai couple, business seems good. Ordered the pad Thai for $5.50, and it has ketchup sauce instead of usual soy sauce. Will try others next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeGNhT05REAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Omelette is delicious with chicken meat and preserved radish (i think). Tom yum soup is not too spicy but still flavourful. Will come back and try other dishes next time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPek1tVF9RRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,Fried dishes such add Kuay Teow and Sambal Kang Kong full of Wok Hei and robust aroma.  Reasonable priced with generous serving.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHFibUd3EAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Great food at very reasonable prices. Just happened to stop by and try. Recommended ! Friendly service too~
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM3JMelFBEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Delicious and value for $!

Recommended if ya looking for affordable Thai food"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXai1MYXp3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Good food value prices. The steam fish was fresh and tasty. Grill squid is out of this world good. (To note, it doesn’t taste as good when you tarpow). And the tom yum soup packs a punch too.

Nice hardworking and friendly couple. Please support."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM0xIbFFnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,"This is the first time im taking photo of my delivered food.

Ordered via foopanda for lunch. I could smell the food as soon as I opened my door. Food was still very hot and very well packed. Tom yum was wrapped and no spillage.

Food was tasty and perfectly spicy as I asked for extra chili. They also gave chili at the side. 2 large prawns in the soup. Perfectly frid egg. It is worth it for delivery of hawker food. Thank you for cooking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dFoySC1nRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Came here to try something else but it was closed. This was surprisingly good and value-for-money, although the egg was overcooked. Also suggest giving less rice to minimise food wastage."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOTh1N2NREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Found out about this hidden gem from a Straits Times review. Ordered their BBQ pork collar (was recommended their pork neck), Tom Yum soup with prawns looked great & tasted great. And added their Thai omelette rice $5.50.

Highly recommended & way superior to anything you can find at Thai enclave at Golden Mile. So authentic, cook is Thai. Legit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxd09HcjdRRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Tried this after seeing good Google reviews and boy was it spot on. Operated by a Thai couple in a modest Balestier road coffeeshop stall, there’s a wide variety of food on the menu. We had to do takeaway during this period but it didn’t affect the quality of the food. We particularly loved how flavourful the Tom Yum was, and it was packed full of ingredients such as fish slices and squid. The basil chicken wasn’t too spicy but it managed to pack a nice punch, especially when I had it with the Tom Yum. The pandan chicken was succulent. Unassuming Thai comfort food. Overall a great experience and we will be back for more.

The pictures don’t do justice to the food as they were taken from a video we shot via screen grab (forgot to take photos)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNU9UZXR3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Go for their Steamed Fish with Lime. Really pack a punch! We also had the omelette with rice which was yum too. Easy and affordable menu, but delivers in terms of taste, service and quality. Plenty of seating space and a drink store where you can order something to put out the Thai spicy sour fire 🔥 Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c01MbE9REAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"We first patronised their stall back when they were at Katong Student Hostel. Visited them again when they moved to Clementi. Now they have moved to Balestier and it's the third time we have looked for them. Now this says something about their food. My absolute favourite dish is the honey chicken, you can ask for the rice version too. Their Phad Thai, mostly different from others with their signature wet style with tomato based sauce is worth mentioning too. This is unusual from most Thai food places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NEpXVWx3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,1,"Disappointing food standards and overpriced.  Oyster Omelette is just fried egg and canned oysters placed on top of it, definitely not the way it is cooked in Thailand.  Basil Leaves Pork with rice and egg, another dish that is not cooked Thai style i.e. has carrots and other veg mixed into it that ruined the taste, and very overpriced. Fried Kai Lan using kai lan that is many days old, not fresh, tasteless and overpriced dish.  Not recommended at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGNycE1REAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,3,"My expectations are high because of the reviews and is unfortunately unmet. Though it is not that bad but it's hype around here are not all that.

The Tom Yam is unlike other thai restos that are all just chili. The broth is tasty and rich. Overall, it's s ok. I'll give a higher score for the Beef Kailan due to its serving size and taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpazREeVZ3EAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,"Steam fish was very good, ok for others such as tang hoon salad (too spicy, suggest to deliberately say low low spice if you wish), 'deep fried pork with rice' is ok, rice was rather hard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aHRla0xnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Second time here - food is amazing, large portion and cheap. Seating at coffee shop is also easily available and clean."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNTZpQTl3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Super value for money and authentic Thai food. Had tomyum soup and mango salad. Even though we ordered the smallest sizes, the serving is generous. They are friendly and have great service too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3ZIVklBEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Good taste like eating in Thailand, cheep price but big portion... highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMGJybWlBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Great place, nice food!! Will definitely come back again!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXc1ktMmVREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Best Thai food outside of Thailand and better than much of the Thai food in Thailand too. Great price, lots of food. The green curry is fantastic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNWE3STRBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"This food stall serves the most authentic Thai cuisine by far.
The food is always fresh and tasty, whether it is takeaway set meal or dine-in ala carte dishes.
Was pleasantly surprised that the Thai lady boss cling wrapped the plastic container of green curry that I takeaway and eliminated the common problem of spillage. Strange that other hawkers don't do the same."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta3F5VTJBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Loved it! Authentic Thai flavours and reasonable prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1emRXbUdnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Of the four Thai food stalls in the area, this one is the best and most affordable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dTZ2RW1BRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"I have been eating their Thai food since they were at Clementi! So glad that they have received the recognition that they deserved! Value for money, good portion, delicious, authentic Thai food! Service is good too :) my go to place for good Thai food for sure!"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dF9FRxAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"My favourite Thai food. Found it a month ago and I think has been eating there at least 3x a week! Loved the steamed fish with lime, basil minced chicken rice, tom yam, seafood tanghoon, green curry chicken, tanghoon salad... go try!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MXZxQU5nEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"You can tell the food is authentic by the Thai couple running the stall. It's not a restaurant but a self-service stall in a relatively large coffee shop. The food is like that served at road side stalls in Bangkok, which is to say that it's delicious. Prices are very reasonable too. However, be prepared to wait a while for the food, as there's only one cook and business is brisk."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ2Z5OEZBEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,3,"Taste good, price good.
Thai green chilly source excellent"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMHBtMWRBEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,We have found this place by chance while strolling around Blaestier Road. Since then we never stopped going back. The food is delicious and the owners are a lovely couple that make you feel at home. Cannot recommend this place enough!! 😍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMC1xMkdnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Best steamed fish ever. Been patroning this joint at least once every two weeks. 👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aHRpWm13RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,3,"The Couple is friendly and nice. The food is average in comparison as they are many good Thai food in Singapore. The portion is not big as stated. The portion is just right. I don't consider cheap there are restaurants in Singapore who serve cheaper and equal quality Thaifood Nahkron, Nangfa, Soi 47, Just Thai with better environment . But still will support as I stayed around that area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbk9UeGNnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Good quality, generous servings, affordable prices. What more can you ask for"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdE9YTXFnRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,What can I say? Food even better than shops in Golden Mile. That is the ultimate compliment! Great service too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnBMdnR3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Food is really tasty, very authentic thai food. Ladyboss is also very friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbU5MMTN3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Very authentic Thai Food. For someone who eat Thai every other week, I rank it amongst one of the better ones in this area. Won’t be disappointed, noticed that the crowd are getting larger."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcDdmcGJnEAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"The couple chef is very cute and the food is priced even cheaper than normal zi char. Everything is around 5-7 for staples and less than 25 for fish. Tasty, good service and cosy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHXzltZ3FRRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,Fantastic food and fantastically priced. Authentic Thai food cooked by Thais. Highly recommended!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X0xMWnl3RRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,Very authentic Thai food. Must order lemon steam seabass. Fresh n soft. Price reasonable.cuttlefish also tasty. 👍👍👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMzRITGR3EAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,2,"Staff came to order for us but he was so slow working and then, curry and nam bread, chicken were not hot. It was feel disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM3NUaHlnRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Yummy and generous portion too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N0xPazhnRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Great customer service, average Thai food pricing! It's a must try, it's so fresh and authentic!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX1k2WnRBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Love this place. Super well cooked food and super sweet couple. Love the pad thai!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbnZ1UFVREAE,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,Hw fried tang Hoon NOT oily!!!I don't understand 😳🤔😝🤪
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxM3BhVmtBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"The dishes are very delicious and rich in variety, which is suitable for children to eat. The price is also very cheap, fair and very good."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNWVqXzBnRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,4,Decent taste thai food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaVlXazBBRRAB,BangKok J.N Thaifood,5,"Having moved from Clementi, my housemates and I chased the storeowners to Balestier. The food prices stayed the same (i.e. very reasonable for the quality). We'll make it a monthly haunt!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta096OW5BRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,"Authentic Thai eatery hidden along a stretch of shops. I did not realize it was a Thai eatery until recently I chanced upon it on Google and went to find it. I ate there with my colleague and we find it good and authentic. The portion is quite decent also.
I came back in the evening to take away pad Thai, pineapple fried rice and fried garlic pork for dinner. Generous portions and tasty. Slightly disappointed with the fried pork as it was soggy - might have been due to the take away journey.

Overall recommended and I will come back to try other dishes"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX01QVkd3EAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,The design of the stall is amazing. Food taste is superb and plenty of variety. They even have set meal for couples. Which I personally think is a good deal and good idea for those who not sure what to have. Thumb up for this place. Parking is also convenient and they also accept non cash transactions. Which is a good thing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXR2OWRnEAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,"Lunch crowd filled this small eatery. Food is good but as its crowded, service would need some improvement
Quite authentic Thai food. It’s also affordable.
But at this industrial area, go if you are around the corner"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcHFELXV3RRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,"An authentic Thai restaurant: 🇹🇭
- Thai servers: checked
- Thai songs in the background: checked
- Photo of the old Thai King on the wall: checked

I ordered their Pad Thai ($6.50) and it was flavourful - the serving was generous. I did a walk in slightly before 12 on a weekday but the place was soon fully occupied with the lunch crowds."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb0lIaHlRRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,"This is without a doubt an authentic Thai food place by Thai folks. Even the simple looking hor fun already tastes better than many zhi char, and the Pad Thai is damn shiok. Fried rice also shiok. Will return to try everything else."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcXV5c0FREAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,Came on a weekday night. Not much queue and food came quite fast. Big portions for each order. One portion definitely enough for two small eaters. Pad Thai was flavourful and pineapple rice come with lots of pineapple. 👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLd3A3cFNREAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,"Great quiet corner for Thai food! Introduced by a food friend to come here for affordable Thai cuisine. We got many dishes ( close to 6) and paid only about $25 - definitely overate.

You must try their Omelette wrap With seafood in tomato sauce. Fillings comprised seafood and mushroom chunks that are really tasty!

Dry sukiyaki glass noodles is also cooked pretty well, and you get a good mix of vegetables, chicken and prawns/springs.

Will definitely be back if I’m in the area!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOWZELUhnEAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,Super economical and delicious. It is just small and abit noisy during lunch time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcGN2djFBRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,1,"Food was average. Had the tom yum soup, basil chicken and glass noodles with prawn. Nothing memorable and lemongrass drink doesnt even have the lemongrass taste. Though price is relatively affordable but there are several other affordable places with better tasting thai food. The staff, this local girl was friendly and nice but thai lad( shld b the boss) was quite arrogant and rude. We wanted to take away 2 dishes as we couldnt finish, staff was kind to suggest she will pack separately but charge us 30c, but eventually the boss insisted that we shld be charged 60c. We r fine to pay cos it wss the staff that made the suggestion in the first place, but eventually 1 of the boxes wasnt even a proper box but a more flimsy plastic. If u wanna charge have thr decency to give a proper box. boxes need to be paid for in cash as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydk9mMHNBRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,Very nice wohei taste of the omelette. Blew me away! Very authentic thai taste and thai ambience! Will visit again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldzU2Mnh3RRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,Delicious food and the portion is generous. The fried prawn tasted fresh and well crisped and that’s  a  clear testimonial of the good cooking skill.   The rest of the seafood in our Tom Yum soup were fresh too. Well visit again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cHVXMlFBEAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,1,"I hope the boss will read this. It will be my first & last visit for my family. Young Chinese lady service staff with black frame spectacle was extremely rude & impatient while taking our orders. No welcome greeting but remark like “I ALREADY SAID there is no other dessert except….”. She looked agitated. How can one hear clearly if she mumbled behind her mask and standing a distance away?  Only repeat once and she can be so curt & rude. A polite crew would reply “sorry our desserts are not available today.” When making payment, she didn’t smile nor say something nice, eg thank you, please come again. Pure transactional like a robot. You have lost a customer who is staying nearby & is a food panda regular. If you are not happy, you quit. Please don’t vent your frustration on your customer, who is supporting your business. The only choice for dessert was tapioca which tasted so hard. Worst I have ever eaten."

Nearest MRT is Taiseng, a short 100m walk and you’ll see a stretch of food stalls.
Place is cozy, and has very Thai ambience. Food is 5/5, but space is limited. Service can be better. Overall, food is good! Great cost performance value."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLZ0l5S1VBEAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,3,The food is authentically Thai but some dishes are overly spicy or sweet. Perhaps this is how it's done just not too suitable for my liking.

The taste is good and close to authentic tai cuisine. The price is also low for the food and table service. Also to surprise dishes came with high portions. Staff is also nice and friendly, did not hesitate to help on the menu. Can become crowded during lunch hours and have to wait to get a table. Can recommend this place"

Service is tremendously bad :) singaporean lady with black specs was absolutely rude, banging the fridge door, raising her voice telling us to take a smaller table, almost shouting at us to speak louder as she says she cant hear us:) the way she spoke to us was literally telling us that she’s unhappy having us here, totally fed up. Came in with a good mood but everything deteriorated after experiencing their worst service. Pretty sure the owners here dont really care about their work attitude as i have heard my friends saying it gets worse as time flies by."

We ordered green curry which was soupy and bland, chicken pieces tough - one of the worst i ever had in Sg or anywhere in the world. Tom yum soup was also bland but seafood was quite fresh. Only the kangkong was decent.  Maybe should have ordered pad thai which seems to be getting rave reviews."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaU9xbURREAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,3,"Been a regular there as food is good at the place. But, there are important things to improve on (especially lately).

Have been there since pre-covid, it’s a simple cozy place. Food is affordable, tastes authentic and very delicious, always enjoyed going there. But recently, it has been disappointing on more than 1 occasion.

On all of these occasions, it’s the same problem - service. Somehow they hired someone new (note: the last time we went, she’s not new anymore. She should have been working there for close to half a year already). This specific staff always got our order wrongly, either forgetting one of the dishes that we ordered, serving dishes first to those that came in later or once even, serving our dish to the wrong table. The people from the table were unaware and touched our bowl. When we pointed that out to the respective staff, she took the bowl from them and passed it directly to us.

In a situation like this (especially when it’s covid period), shouldn’t she change the bowl to a new one before serving it to us? It’s basic hygiene standards. And when we pointed out that we were not comfortable with eating from the bowl that other people have touched it already, she and the kitchen staff started shouting back and forth in Thai language in front of us. And the kitchen staff even banged the table at the counter more than once while shouting or complaining. At certain point, even glaring at us. As if it’s our mistake.

Ever since then, I have never felt comfortable going back again. I really hope they improve on this staff issue. It’s such a waste when their food is really good.

Just a note, I have tried giving chances and returned to patronise the store after I noticed the drop in their service. But it just gets worse every time. We also patronise around near 8pm when crowd is slower. This didn’t happen when it was busy.

And no, I do not expect very good or impressive service. But just simple service like getting our food right, proper hygiene and proper manners."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MDZYY253RRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,The food and ambience was pretty good. I really liked the sukiyaki glass noodles. The green curry was slightly underwhelming as there was too much coconut milk in my opinion. But on a whole price was worth the meal!

I was under the influence that if you had ordered a fish, a meat, a veg and an egg... You will be looking at 50 bucks in bkk. Well, I was filled at 45ish and 4 pax. What else is there to complain?  The portions are decent, the taste is authentic. I don't know what others are looking at for their Thai food. But I tasted Thailand the moment I entered the place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbE5qYjdBRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,"Really good Thai food at reasonable prices (all nett, which is great). They’ve got some decent lunch set menus too. Quite a small space so a little hard to get a table with the weekday lunch crowd."

outside says cash only but accepts grabpay.

food was quite nice. authentic as they all look and sound thai. basil pork rice was like a simple home cooked meal. makes me want to get my own minced meat and make."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcmEtWnBnRRAB,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,5,Ordered on grabfood. Was a very delightful meal. Had the tomyum soup which did not leave me thirsty and was a good balance of spicy and sour and the seafood was not mushy either. The vegetable had a sauce tht went well with the rice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRenFTd05nEAE,Koat Aroy Authentic Thai Cuisine,4,"Ordered a Tom yam noodle soup, non spicy clear pork (ball) soup, mango salad, cold Thai milk tea and fresh coconut, between the two of us and the bill only came up to $27.80. The salad was crunchy, and had the right bland of spiciness and soreness. The Tom yang noodle soup was lovely as well. The clear pork soup. . I like my soup spicy so between two soup I much prefer the tom. Yang, however th epotk balls were very moist and tasty and I'm sure kids would that. I'm going back again for  sure."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ1BXYUxBEAE,Uno Beef House,4,"Chicken Cutlet

🍜 Food wise: Fries were hot and quite well salted. The cutlet was tender, well marinated and well fried. The lemon was interesting as it gives the cutlet a more refreshing taste.

This is surely one of the comfort food.

Side note, their steak smells really good!

✨ Ambience wise: Coffee shop ambience

🤵🏻 Service wise: Uncle was friendly!

💵 Price wise: $7.50 for this plate of goodness."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteGF6U2hBRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"Coffee Shop pricing and good old school style western food.

Love the potato ball and their coleslaw. The fries are the thick cut type and is nice too (although I love string fries).

The fried rice is very tasty and not overcook.

Love this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNWV5OHFnRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"We had the sirloin and chicken chop fried rice. Both were yummy!  Medium rare was more medium than rare but the flavour was great.  The giant potato hall was a nice change from the usual fries/baked potato.  Chicken chop was grilled really well, almost crispy skin.  Be ready to wait during peak lunch hour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3NlZWFREAE,Uno Beef House,4,"Mmmmmmmmmh. This was my first time here and thumbs up for one of the better steaks that I've tasted in awhile. Tender juicy medium rare ribeye steak that is made to perfection.

I must say the black pepper sauce is indeed unique, not too peppery and just generally great to enjoy it with the steak.

The complement fried potato side dish is very unique and tasty as well. Will come back and try the other menu items next!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd09lZWdnRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"This place is another great find in Singapore! It’s a Singapore “Western” food stall, so you will find steak, fried chicken, and various dishes for the “western” palates. Now you m not a fan of “Western” hawker stalls and have tried a few, but this place blew me away! Their fried chicken wings were delicious! The batter was nice and crispy with the flavor that outshines KFC. I wish they had spicy!!! Their steaks were nice and tender. Great deal for the price I paid! Be sure to order it rare because when it’s served on a hot plate, the steak will become medium. Also, nice touch in the mashed potatoes. They are served in the form of deep fried balls. Overall, I will definitely come here again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ29QNHJRRRAB,Uno Beef House,4,"Steak lover approved! Ordered the $20 black pepper tenderloin steak in medium rare (actually like medium), thoroughly enjoyed the piece of juicy and soft steak! Pepper sauce was mild, and the steak was delicious for coffee shop standard.  Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeXJtLWZBEAE,Uno Beef House,4,"We waited for about 45mins. But the staff did warn us before we order. Friendly staff took order at the cashier. Note they do not serve ice with soft drinks.

Overall food is nice.
Spaghetti serving was huge! Forgot to take a pic though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc1BiYnVBRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"Hearty main course. Sides are great too.

Tried their food 3yrs ago and I rem it’s much nicer. So I would say their standard has dropped quite abit.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X3JhenlBRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,One of the best neighborhood western food stall. Followed them from three locations in Toa Payoh. Son of the owner is now running the show and very customer oriented. I loves their butter whipped potatoes besides their lovely main courses.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLb0lXcWFREAE,Uno Beef House,4,"Visited twice in a week, skip the pork chop (also included in mix grill), too hard. Chicken cutlet ($7) and sirloin steak ($12) were good value for money. Fried chicken wings had nice crunch, worth a try at $1.50 per piece."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Mk1IUmZnEAE,Uno Beef House,4,"Ordered the Ribeye (med rare). Done-ness  was quite spot on.

Beef quality better than some western stalls in other coffee shops.
Would like the pepper sauce to be more prominent in terms of flavor.

Price wise is on the high side but still worth a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OE9hWUNBEAE,Uno Beef House,3,"Sad to said it’s just a normal steakhouse in a coffee shop.

45mins of waiting time is way too long for a small portion of steak on a hot plate which cost $16 dollars.

The side dish only offer less then 1/4 of tomato, 1 fried mash potato and small portion of baked bean. If they change it to the bake potatoes with toppings + some carrots and broccoli. That will be better.

The only good point is that the beef is soft and tender."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2b2JYcW53RRAB,Uno Beef House,4,"Mix Grill. A coffeeshop style western food stall that is almost the anchor stall of the whole coffeeshop, their cuts are decent and you feel like you get the bang of your buck."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcU5ldmJBEAE,Uno Beef House,4,Tabao their ribeye steak. It’s tender and not gamey. Sauce is lightly peppered and not salty. I’m impressed with their fried potato ball. It’s crust is thin not oily and packed with flavour. Hope to have some garden veggies option than coleslaw.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dktEd01REAE,Uno Beef House,5,Awesome place. One of my fave western at TPY.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LWMtNGZBEAE,Uno Beef House,4,Sirloin Steak and Chicken cutlet are good and highly recommended. Chicken Chop is average but lamb chop too dry. Overall is good but repare to wait if reach after 6pm in weekend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOHEtcGpnRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"My first visit! We didn’t want to shell out a lot for some western food and came across this value-for-money, old-school joint. The chicken cutlet is one of the best I’ve had recently, tender on the inside with a crust that is crisp and not bready. The coleslaw, baked beans and fries were fresh and tasty. The tenderloin steak was juicy; medium rare finished perfectly to a pink centre on the nostalgic steakhouse style hot plate . Will be back! Note that they’re moving to TPY Lor 1!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcTZ5TGlnRRAB,Uno Beef House,5,"Relocated from 51 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh.

Here you get to enjoy one of the most authentic western food.

Famous for its Sirloin Steak, this is the real deal!

Must try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpblBtZnlnRRAB,Uno Beef House,4,"UNO BEEF HOUSE is located in Toa Payoh along Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, at a coffeeshop under a HDB. Carpark is just beside the coffeeshop.

Beef Spaghetti ($6.00)
It was a spaghetti that was full of unpleasant surprises. The spaghetti tasted too soggy while the tomato sauce did not stand out. The real surprise was the mined beef as they felt like normal bolognaise. The beef was not unpleasant tasting but was just not outstanding from recommendation. Just a plate of tomato based sauce pasta with a touch of minced beef.

Mixed Platter ($12.00)
I went for the Mixed Platter which includes chicken chop, pork chop, bacon, ham, egg, fries, baked beans and a garlic bread. The pork chop was the only disappointment as the meat was dry, tough and was not well seasoned. On the other hand, the bacon was very flavorful and was crispy with a slightly charred side. The sunny side up egg had a really runny yolk which we gladly mopped up with the crispy garlic bread.

Bacon & Egg ($5.50)
Another friend went for the bacon as he could not resist, when the point was for him to try the pasta. Bacon was rather salt to have too many in my honest opinion but it was to his liking. It comes with two eggs, baked beans, garlic bread, coleslaw & fries. Nothing really fanciful about the dish. Probably something that would shine better for breakfast rather than lunch/dinner for the usual patrons."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcFlDclZnEAE,Uno Beef House,5,You can’t really complain for the price and quality you get. Tenderloin on a hot plate for $18 is a steal. Meat was tender and substantial. Not like those thin slices you often get from hawker centres they charge you $10 for. Probably one of the best old school steak places you can find anywhere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNXFQbEl3EAE,Uno Beef House,5,"The food is uniquely done! Items to take note are the steaks, mashpotato that are fried into ball shape but soft on the inside and the fried chicken wing that is a must eat!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeHJLTkxBEAE,Uno Beef House,4,tried it 3 times. their pork chop ($7) was quite hard. chicken chop taste better. i dun eat beef but ppl who ordered beef makes mi drool. it smells heavenly.

The mash potatoes fried ball is butter yummy. The fried rice is actually above average and surprise to find shrimp in there. However do note that the steak is not cheapt starting at 13 for sirloin and 15 for ribeye and 18 for tenderloin if I am not wrong. However one of the much better western food stall out there.

The black pepper sauce here is out of this world. It is thick, meaty, savoury, peppery and salty in a good way. Makes anything dip or slathered in it so yummy. Also like the light n fluffy round ping pong ball shaped thing served with the steak. Texture like a cake but goes well with the black pepper sauce"

Recommended food: Ribeye Beef Steak

Drove all the way to Toa Payoh to check out what's the hype with this neighbourhood western food that was featured in quite a few news articles and food reviews. Sad to say it is not really worth the hype. The ribeye cost 15 dollars which is quite reasonablely price, however in terms of taste it just tasted like most neighbourhood western food, of course those good ones. The pork chop is medicore, nothing special. In conclusion, the western food here is very average in terms of taste, and it serve well as a neighbourhood western food, but definitely not worth to specially travel down for food tasting."

sounds ironic? so yeah, ratings base on their fish & chips, have yet tried theur other dishes.... one can only eat so much at a time, a pity

their fish are those standard frozen sutchi fillets, quite well done and pretty tasty.

i suspect that the batter they used for their fish are likely to be the same used for their chicken wings and cutlet, not complaining as it taste kinda good

the coleslaw taste great, btw. can't say the same for the garlic bread which is definitely stale

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta055Nmd3RRAB,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,5,"Quite a special menu with jumbo frankfurter, bacon carbonara, aglio olio and mix n match options.
Thumbs up for the chef's meticulousness to every last detail... During Sat peak dinner every pork chop that came off the grill was lightly dabbed with a fresh kitchen paper towel to absorb the excess oil before serving
Great relaxing dinner with a refreshing glass of Dunkel from Otto Berlin Haus... One glass wasn't quite enough. Btw this is a drinks stall with quite a history.
Note, try not to sit directly in front of the mala stall. The fumes from the frying nearly killed everyone nearby but thank goodness he keeps his frying short... Gonna try that mala sometime."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzRxQWN3EAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,5,My new favourite hawker western food. Pork cutlet is amazingly tasty and juicy !
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMXVYOUZREAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,5,Tabao their Fried rice with pork chop @ $6.80. Good and not expensive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ejRTVUNnEAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,1,Worst western I have ever have. The chicken chop and fish fried rice is totally cannot make it. Totally tasteless is it Bec price went up so put lesser ingredients. Don't waste a dollar here there's other western around at toa payoh and also taste better and the price is lower.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN01lV093EAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,5,"Great food at affordable prices. If you're looking for cheap western food, this is it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX3VQN0xBEAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,1,Terrible wait time. Waited more than 1 hour for my food when they told me it will take 20-30 mins. Some more food so so
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNTVEOGJREAE,SIN MING GRILL WESTERN FOOD,4,"Food is not bad, cheap but be prepared to wait...gets crowded and also does a lot of deliveries."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBd1A2Z01BEAE,Z & Y Western Food,5,"Just realised I have been patronising this stall for 15 years ever since I was in secondary school and I think it really deserves a review. The food has been consistently good throughout the years and you get a good sense that the owners really take pride in their ingredients and quality.

I've also never had a dish here that disappointed me and when I visited today, the pork chop $7 was excellent, very tender and the portion generous. They also make their own coleslaw and this might be one of the best coleslaws I've tasted in Singapore (so none of that KFC garbage-tasting coleslaw). If you are looking for an affordable and filling meal, you can also pair their fried rice with a protein like chicken chop or fish.

So show some support for this little joint if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMTU2dFVBEAE,Z & Y Western Food,1,"The pork chop used to be my favourite and had been visiting over the past 10 years, however recent visit was disappointing as the standard had dropped"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aF9Lc2NnEAE,Z & Y Western Food,1,"Food are good, but the old lady serving is really rude and uneducated. She said something like, if u can wait wait, with unpolite tone. I know she's busy, but can she be considerate. Hope she sees theis."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NHJfZGlnRRAB,Z & Y Western Food,4,"Good old school Western food, waiting time can be easily 30 mins or more during peak hour, but the lady boss will always inform you about the estimated timing, if u can't wait, you can always try others food and somewhere else. Dine-in, they still serve the food to you instead of self service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLelpMTm1RRRAB,Z & Y Western Food,5,"Childhood nostalgia taste. Ate in Primary - Secondary school. After many years taste the same. Same standard , great and friendly service. Never ever disappointed with the food!😍🥰🥰💕💕💕"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNFAtY3lRRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Homely restaurant that’s a family favorite. Mushroom soup @$5.80 was served with warm garlic butter bread. Kid’s meal was fish and chips @$8, enough for a small eater. It comes with a cup of apple juice and end off with a scoop of ice cream! Always a crowd pleaser. Chicken steak came sizzling on a hot plate and potato topped with yummy sour cream, bacon bits and green onions! The service was prompt and polite. Overall, a place we enjoy good food and service with family."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd0xQdlhREAE,Jack's Place,3,"A no frills restaurant in Toa Payoh. Situated just below OrangeTee building makes it very convenient for people to access. A nice place for a meal especially for the lunch crowd.

Food was ok. Good value as we often go for the set lunches. Option to upgrade to lobster bisque should really be considered as the lobster bisque is nice. Baked potato with kits of onions and sour cream is great too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeFBuR3BnRRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Give 4 star for service...
Not the food..
Their service crew are older folks.. so they tend to be more attentive to kids and old folks......
You go in... With kids..
They will get the baby chairs first....
And once awhile will come ask if anything u need.

But the food is plain so so....

The 1 for 1...
From 2.30 pm to 5pm.. is enticing..

But twice we went....
The beef seems very soft and both times my wife says that the beef has a smell..
I tried... It is like... The meat has been defrosted.. in And out of the chiller too many times.....
Not sure. . Maybe some experts can give their views...

Their coke... And coke light ...
Coke light is by the Can.. so they sell $4.
But the coke is $3. Pour by the bottle....
So be prepared the drink doesn't have gas...

As a chain western outlet...
Just plain...
Normal western."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGNHOUZ3EAE,Jack's Place,4,"Inflation has taken a hit on the price and portion size and the shortage of workers is visible with only half the seating capacity opened. We waited only five minutes for our turn 😊

The cutlery is not so clean and we had to wash it ourselves.

The dessert of the cake was panna cotta which is fine. It used to be cake and we remember the cake we used to have was really good and we complimented the restaurant for it when we visited back in March.

The soup of the day was chicken soup with vegetables. Still value for money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjdhanBRRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"order a triple meat grill. and seafoods marinara with ice cream and ice lemon tea
triple meat grill - beef cut is quite bad with thick layer of inedible. chicken not grilled enough .  sausage is very basic . i would say it is a decent dish that shall be priced at 15-18 instead of 20+
the food not hot as it was serve together with the pasta .
seafood marinara - the ingredients is fresh and generous. only issue is the sauce too watery.
ice lemon tea - very normal concentrate taste
ice cream- is call gelato but taste like normal marigold ice cream

be prepared to spend some time for waiting food . is not as fast as usual western cuisine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a2VQQk93EAE,Jack's Place,4,"The steak was great. Soup was so so. Dessert was one scoop of ice cream. $7 add on for soup and dessert not very worth it. Service was not bad. Not crowded, so quite comfortable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXckotSC1RRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Had the rib-eye steak and the signature. Loved the sour cream baked potato. Beef was hot and not too bad for medium well. Expect to wait a little during peak hour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1amN1bHhnRRAB,Jack's Place,3,Queued 45mins to get in during lunch hours on frid. Lack of staff. Food came quite fast after ordering so ok. Missed out the water i ordered... But Bolognase Cheese Fries quite nice. Fish is very plain but crispy. Have to eat w the sauce. Soup of the day was cauliflower soup which comes w the garlic bread. My friend like the chicken alfredo. Not so much the chicken but the pasta was nice. (forgot to take photo). Wont be back again sorry.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnQ2YjV3RRAB,Jack's Place,3,"11 Sep 2022, just visited this restaurant for dinner. Firstly, place not so crowded during my visit around 5.30pm. Maybe this restaurant need some upgrade to its carpet. It seems very old and wear out. The little icon outside the restaurant look so dirty and old. I am not too sure if this is ""Feng Shui"". Haha... I think the restaurant manager need to look into it and give a New Life to this icon statue. Food wise, I would say ok. Comparable to Aston. However, Aston prices are slightly cheaper. Sad to say that this is one of the restaurant in Singapore that does not serve you free drinking or tap water. They charge 50 cents per customer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1djYyWDBBRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Quiet and Cosy Cafe. Signature woody decor. Great place to meet friends.  Service is quick.  Prices are reasonable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3VyLTN3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Lovely meal but the branch is severely understaffed!! Management should amp up their hiring because the staff there are clearly doing their best, very dedicated and polite but struggling."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cmEtVml3RRAB,Jack's Place,1,"I'm... so... shockingly sad. :( Ordered a Medium Rare Fillet Mignon, it came presentable but when I tried to cut it, the meat was so tough. Took forever to chew as well. The picture below speaks for itself. I forced myself to finish it as it cost $30+. Really felt like crying as it was the worst beef I've eaten and I'm not even a ""steak expert"". Just want to warn future diners what they're in for - Very tough meat and microwaved vegetables.
(also, iced water is served with one ice cube lol)
This review is made on September 2021."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnFqSTdBRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Went here my father-in-law's birthday party and asked for a mango mousse but they ran out of stock.

Gladly they're offering an onde-onde cake as a replacement despite the price is more expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cFp5TjNnRRAB,Jack's Place,1,"waited for almost 40mins for my meal to be served correctly, my family ate finish already then i can start eating…i ordered lobster with rice but at first they served me seafood spaghetti then followed by lobster with spaghetti??2 wrong orders served consecutively, manager wasn’t sincere and apologetic too , and lastly the rice was hard.., lobster was cold"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNWFUSUhREAE,Jack's Place,2,"Standard of the place has dropped overall.
1. First they did not serve (or even ask, for that matter) water. It was only after about 20 mins after we asked for water that it was served.
2. Then they forgot to serve us the soup that came with the set meal. After we asked they took awhile to verify with each other whether anyone did serve the soup. Eventually arrived after the main course did.
3. One of us ordered the steak well done, and it was so tough that he had difficulties cutting it with the steak knife.
4. For some reason they were reluctant to clear the table. Many service staff walked past and looked to see if we were done eating, but despite the obvious empty dishes, no one bothered to clear. When they served the coffee and ice cream there was not enough space on the table but yet the staff still tried to put the cups and bowls down without clearing, until we had to ask them to do so. Seriously?
5. The steak was supposed to come with slices of King mushroom. The plural only meant there were two pieces instead of one. And superbly thinly sliced too, at that. Have to admire the skill of the chef.

Will seriously reconsider whether to come back here ever again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bUlXUWhBRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Cosy western food restaurant with great food. However some grilled cuisine requires chilli sauce or pepper to enhance the favour. The platter and apple pie is good. Overall not bad.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2FxVzNBRRAB,Jack's Place,1,Only one staff saved this place with his great service. Other than that service was HORRIBLY slow as they are terribly understaffed. Waited for nearly 1hr for my food in total and the food quality is not worth it all. Definitely will avoid this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlck4yeFB3EAE,Jack's Place,3,"Had one of the most disappointing experience at Jack's Place. I grew up eating JP and I will always remember its great service and food, but today's experience tainted the image of JP.

We ordered their triple meat grill and the meat(doneness was great) but the pasta was way undercooked. The manager on the ground was quick to resolve my unhappiness but in return, I still received undercooked pasta with some mushroom sauce(not sure if their pasta was microwaved).

Understanding that drink and dessert will be served after your main course. Only our dessert arrived and we did not receive our drink at all (suspect that they forgot about it). When we rectified at the counter, they apologized and offered us can drink instead which we declined.

I can empathise with it lack of manpower(as I used to work in an F&B outlet), but at least remember your customer's order and delivered it on time when requested.

Kudos to the manager who hears my feedback, but I'm still taken a back by today's experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aklIbWl3RRAB,Jack's Place,2,"The family restaurant feeling is waning. Gone are the set meals. Everything is alacarte. Food portion has shrunk, fish and chips only 1pcs instead of 2pcs. Service has deteriorated, starting top down from the restaurant manager , even when the restaurant is half filled...We would have walked out if not because we have ordered. Maybe last visit"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXBYaDV3RRAB,Jack's Place,2,Very bad. Had the three meat grilled spaghetti dish. The waiting time was the horrid - we had two gelato and we told three different staff (including the manager) that they can serve but we waited for 20 minutes and we just left cos we couldn't wait longer ...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMk9QVGhBRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"Jack’s Place has been around for a long, long while. But it seems food quality has dropped slightly over the years, albeit the food is still good and value for money.

The garlic bread wasn’t as crisp as usual, ie it was sagging a bit under its own weight. But it still tasted okay.

The lobster bisque and the soup of the day (minestrone) were both nice.

The steaks weren’t that juicy, to be honest. But they were still well cooked and seasoned, so they were still great.

The baked potatoes were extremely filling, but still tasted good.

The dessert was a cherry and mango pie, which was pretty nice.

All in all, the food was pretty average, the main draw being the value for money it allows.

However, the service was top notch, being extremely prompt and friendly to boot. (This may have been because I arrived at 11am, before peak lunch time).

Overall, the food is just like any other Jack’s Place, but the service is prompt, genuine and doesn’t leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bm8zUFRnEAE,Jack's Place,4,"Good attention, variety of dishes. Amazing curly fries. Big menu.
A lot of sugar in the cold tea, like a heavy syrup, not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OUlhSExREAE,Jack's Place,5,"The food came quickly and the quality of food was satisfactory. Service was extraordinary,  staff were attentive. Staff Suman upon seeing my pregnant wife provided a pillow to support her back. 👍 Positive experience"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNmNEd2pnRRAB,Jack's Place,2,"Favourite food from Jack’s Place is its potato jacket with cream and bacon bits. Cheese fries were not too bad, chunky fries were crispy. Other than that, Salted Egg Chicken Cutlet was oily and not the most delicious salted egg sauce around. Buffalo wings had a strange taste. Panna Cotta dessert looked more like a mousse cake."

Local chain restaurant offering western food. This old time restaurant has been around more than 25 years ago. Their food has evolved from selling steak to pasta. Overall their food is average and the price is reasonable."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdnVPWlFnEAE,Jack's Place,3,Decent restaurant for western food. We like their fish & chips and lobster bisque soup. This store also has an Udders ice-cream store inside. Usually not crowded and located next to Toa Payoh MRT.

Ordered a rare steak which they served as per my order. Just the way i like it.

Was very well satisfied with my dinner tonight."

Upon arrival, I had to seek out the asst Mgr at the reception counter to be seated. I was not even decently greeted by the AM. Not only did I have to wait for my table, I also had to summon the AMs attn that I was ready to order. I was abrubtly served n waited patiently for my steak which arrived 20mins later.  I had strip steak w standard sides. I was not given the rundown but had to ask. Midway, the AM sauntered to the table behind me to enquire about their steak. Not a peep to me on how I was doing w mine free meal. Having managed restaurants overseas as an area Mgr. I'm appalled at the lack of care and  professionalism at this Jack's Place. It seemed that the staff has adopted the scruff manegerial behavior!!!  Nevertheless, i sincerely ask that the owners of this place look into the operation. Fyi I visited restaurant at the tailend of lunch rush. I used to visit the very first restaurant at killineyw w my parents n service then was much more pleasant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaEtuVFBBEAE,Jack's Place,2,"In a nutshell, mediocre food at premium prices. Steak was pricey and literally tough to swallow.

I wish they can create the Bhutanese version with cheese ;) I miss that chilli cheese momo in Bhutan. The meat in both main dish 'Chicken Tash With Pulau' and 'Nepali Lamb Choila' are very tasty 😋 Hub said he went there with too high an expectation (he had actual nepalese food on himalayan mount before) so he wasn't too satisfied but I enjoyed the food 😄 I think I will return 😋 Anyway it seems like western food is more popular here. The western food serving looks generous and great plating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bUxlZFVBEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,1,"Pros: nett price
Cons:
We went there Sunday night, 19th September 2021, and there wasn't a lot of people but it was very chaotic. The staff were arguing (guy in yellow shirt at counter was screaming to the staff to ""open their eyes"") and there was a lot of banging of plates. It's a small indoor seating area so the noise was very hard to ignore.
We ordered a set meal with one mushroom soup(top up $1, the soup of the day was chicken soup) and one chicken soup and chocolate cake.
My friend is a vegetarian so ordered veggie chow mien and the mushroom soup. The older lady taking our order didn't write down any of our orders.
We were served two chicken soup and when we informed them, they didn't even realise that we ordered mushroom soup (keyed in wrong order, maybe can write down the order next time?)
The mushroom soup took about 10 minutes to serve.
Then the Chinese waitress served my friend ""chicken chow mien"" and when my friend asked if its veggie chow mien instead, she was like ""oh ya, that""
For dessert, the Chinese waitress served us yellow sponge cake and said it was prune cake and then said it was cheesecake? She didn't even know the menu... It was a regular pound cake (the type you can buy at giant supermarket) and we asked what about the chocolate cake the older lady told us about? And she said they ran out.... They didn't even inform us about it.
Food is edible. But the portion is questionable. Do Not order the pizza. Its $12 for a pan sized, those you can get for better quality for $5 at pizza hut. The dough was also RAW. Also asked for extra sauce because chicken was dry but was told have to add $1 for any sauce lol. This is the first place I've been to where I heard such thing. Other places like Aston don't have?
Overall, horrible service and bad atmosphere. Been here before where we were served by I think it was the owner, older guy with glasses, who was very polite. Unfortunately, this time, was a bust."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlemZYb25BRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,Nice cozy restaurant in the hood. Great for dining out with friends. Food is top quality and service is great. Price is reasonable too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM01EMzlRRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"I move around in Singapore a lot and had a chance to try out this restaurant due to a friend's suggestion. They mentioned they serve Nepalese cuisine and it's rare to find such a cuisine that's located in an old heartland estate like Toa Payoh. The restaurant is spacious and the service staff is friendly. Most importantly, they really do have Nepalese cuisine as stated, alongside a variety of Western fare, which many old folks who dine there go for. (Maybe because they have a senior citizen discount special which was really nice!). We had 2 appetizers and a main course and the serving size for the appetizers were family size but we stillanaged to finish it. It's my first time trying Nepalese cuisine and it's actually quite interesting - worth a try really! I would love to try out the Western fare next if I can! And they currently have 20% discount on ala-carte."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aE42dElBEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,"A hidden restaurant for tasty and value for money food.. The Nepali chicken Tash, Gumbo Soup, chicken momos, brownie with ice cream and house pour red wine was amazing. Genuinely reccomend this place..I think it’s underrated and deserves 10 stars.. service was great and warm too . I am coming back for sure ☺️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2d1lfVlVREAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,A surprise gem right in the middle of housing estates. Tims Restaurant & Cafe is great for family and small group gathering. A wide variety of western and Napalese food at affordable prices with korean beer and wine to complete your fine dining in the heartlands.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eC1iWTBBRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,1,"Food standard & prices same as before. Only thing is staff service & attitude must improve. Need to go for basic service quality course if possible. Young guy at cashier counter with attitude, need to improve his service & manners. Miss the warm feeling of last time when the male boss at dinning hall talking to customers. Don’t expect much of service quality but at least the basic from them but that also don’t have. Ts is my honest opinion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbF9HM1JnEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,I love Nepalis food. I love the herbs taste
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cFpDUUFREAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,"Tabaoed this for dinner on our way to our friend’s house nearby. Ordered the Nepalese chicken with rice and 2 different types of salmon. Price isn’t the cheapest but food is good enough. Like the chicken very much due to its seasoning. Rice, vegetables and mashed potatoes are all good too. Service is as good as what I remembered it to be. The teriyaki salmon can be softer though. Otherwise all good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeUlpNG9BRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,Very accommodating people work here. I like that they do try their best to Ensure we have a good time even in this trying period. The food is quite well prepared and I am surprised at the speed. Pizza size is smaller than outside so do order 2 if you are planning to share. Lamb shank is very well done - loved it. The Beef tenderloin is okay for the price that I am paying but the black pepper sauce is too over powering. Chicken with pork ribs is disappointing but chicken is well marinated.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXFTN1pnEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,"Tims Restaurant & Cafe is a cafe me and my family will frequent as they have 50% pricing for senior citizens for selected menu. They are one of the rare cafe that focuses on Nepal food. Most of the choices are western food.

Their western dishes are value for money. The portion is also generous. Set meals of $4.50 includes a drink (coffee, tea or milo), soup of the day and a dessert. It did not take too long for the food to be served upon order. For the coffee and dessert, you would need to let them know when to be served after you finish your main meal.

The ambience is also rather homely and is suitable for family with kids to dine in at.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaFlPdVlBEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,"Favorite fusion restaurant in the hood. Oysters could have been fresher but for the rest of the dishes - from steaks to fish&chips, no complaints. Come here every year for Christmas Eve / NYE dinner and they never disappoint. If you visit during the non-festive periods, they have senior citizen discounts too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTdmOEJREAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Tried the Nepali food again this 2nd time that I went. The last time I was there was about 7-8 years ago and I had the sherpa noodles. It's no longer on the menu but this time, I shared 2 of the Nepali dishes - the lamb and chicken with rice - with 2 friends and the pakora (?). They were all delicious. Pakora was piping hot and crispy when it arrived, and all snapped up by our table of 5 immediately. The lamb was so flavourful that I can't wait to have it again the next time I go. The chicken was good, too, but I prefer the lamb. Only downer was the yuzu drink that tasted like it had too little yuzu.

The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. Went there on a crowded Friday evening, but food still came fairly fast. Hope to be back again soon with my family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdkpQSmhBRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"The lobster with steak were amazing. The Nepalese chicken has a special and unique taste on its own. The fries was really good. We went there on an eatigo app discount of 30%. Please remember to make reservations prior to arrival to enjoy the eatigo discount. It's a pretty neighbourhood and quiet place. The price is around $10 - 20 depends on the mains u ordered. But with the eatigo discount, we only paid 30 bucks for the amazing food that we ordered. Definitely will recommend this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzeVlmdDNRRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"A hidden gem in the neighbourhood with a wide selection of western/nepalese food. It has been around for more than a decade, and the owner is very friendly. Food quality was way better than Jack's Place and prices were very reasonable!

Some bad stuff tho:

1. The pizza we ordered was a bit too small and tasted like it came from Cold Storage.

2. Mashed potato tasted like it came from a powdered packet

3. Service was very very slow on a crowded Sunday and we had to set aside more than an hour for lunch.

I think service might be much better on quieter weekdays."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b0tETkhREAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,1,"Brought my dad here for dinner on a Saturday night.

Waitress was a chinese auntie (possibly lady boss) gave us one menu and stood beside us right away, expecting us to quick fire our orders to her. Asked for some time to look thru the menu as it was my first time visiting. She literally walked one round the restaurant (30 secs), and came back standing beside my table again.

While I was translating the English menu to my dad, she kept interrupting and suggested us to order the dishes she recommended. My dad got pretty annoyed and said to dine at another place instead. I returned the menu to her and apologized for the trouble, but she just rolled her eyes and did not even acknowledge me. Dodged a bullet and definitely not dining here ever."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbG95WldnEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Friendly service. First time dining in a Nepalese restaurant.

The fish and chips was a huge serving. The Nepali pork belly was extremely tender and flavourful, comes with pulau rice and Nepali salad.

We had the moumou for the first time. Nice sized and tasty. Are they suppose to taste like xiaolongbao with curry seasoning? :) Will find another moumou to compare."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnd29LZXFBRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,"After 10 years of being his customer, food is still good and delicious. Never fail to impress me. For a successful place he has, the boss Tom is still a very humble man, still hands-on at his own place and provides great service. Not overly priced western and Nepalese food. Definitely a good place for a good cravings fix."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZck9DTHhRRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Frills-free restaurant cum cafe that sells western and Nepalese food. The food is not too bad but the service is commendable, the staff were eager to serve and friendly. There are set meals to choose from; daily ones, student and even for senior citizens (60 and above). I enjoyed the butternut squash soup, their signature ribs (fall-off-the-rack, hickory sauce?), Sausage (juicy!) lemon tea and colesaw. Apart from that, the sides of fries was normal and mashed potato a little too dry, the steak could be more seasoned and the mushroom sauce was just ok (maybe the other sauces are better). Other than baramundi, the fish used (such as in the grilled fish and fish and chips) was mushy but i guess you get what you pay for? The tiramisu was tasty and more of a well-set cake. If I do visit again, would want to try the Nepalese food here. If you want coffee, perhaps should try Shrove Tuesday among the opposite row of shops which sells waffles and coffee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVOWRtYnJ3RRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,3,"Interesting cafe with cosy setting, serving both Nepalese and Western. Rice is very fragrant, meat is herby but rather dry. Western dishes are average, portion is quite large though. Good when you want to try something different."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDczVPR2hnRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Good food, quite affordable but the service can be overwhelmed when there is a crowd. So you must constantly chase abit.

Overall ok, would go back and try their ox tail.

Delivers by grab and accepts grab pay"

Their Christmas Special menu is extremely delicious and well prepared, early orders are a must! One of the very few affordable places that serves their turkey succulent enough to wipe away your fear of dry turkey. (Not yet released but you can pre-order takeaway for Christmas dining in the comfort of your home.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeTlPWXV3RRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Value for money lunch sets

Paid 12.80 nett for a 3 course meal with a choice of drink. There was no service charge nor gst which is awesome!

The food was generally fair. I very much like the chicken stragonoff with rice as it warms my soul. Service was fast and good.

Will recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0c2ZhMWNBEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"It was a Public Holiday, and we headed out to Toa Payoh for something different. Chanced upon Tim's Restaurant not too far from our favourite chicken rice, and what a gem it turned out to be. This simple Nepalese joint serves up very decent western fare. Besides they have excellent staff with immense patience with the customers! Is recommended this once to anyone, but don't take MY word for it; go try for yourself!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpLXB6MGd3RRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"Cozy place in a lay back area.  Enjoyed both the food and service.

Spoilt by the choices we have, therefore took us quite a while before we can decide.
Ordering your food with as set is definitely a better deal ($4.50 c/w soup, cake, coffee/tea/soft drink).

I like the Friday’s tomato soup with basil.
Lamb rack was nicely done, the brown sauce was not over powering so that with pinch of salt it brought out the goodness of it. $23

Ribeye steak was good enough for me, reminds me of Jack’s place. 220g (I think) of goodness at $22.80 as a set I feel is quite a good deal.

The MoMo was an experience. Mine mind was kinda confused as it looks like Xiao long Bao but of course taste different.

Will try the Oxtail stew on my next visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaUktRE13EAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"A nice restaurant around Toa Payoh. They serve Nepalese cuisine and western dish. Overall the food was okay, nothing fantastic but I gave 4 stars because the service was good and they are senior-friendly with a lot of discount."

And the price is increased by 80cent to a dollar?!? Ok to many the price does not matter but this is actually an issue.. it is like we are 'scammed'? If my fam knew about the increased in price, we would have reconsidered the set meal."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NXJqb01BEAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,Tims is a very cozy little restaurant serving nice western food. The staff here is nice and friendly. Food is always consistently good. Generous portions for what we refer to as neighbourhood price. I recommend their chicken cutlet - crunch on the outside but juicy on the inside. Their steak and seafood on specials are often good too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOVB5SGJ3EAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,Good food at affordable price. Decided to try this place after my treatment at the TCM next door. Overall the food is good and the service staff is friendly and efficient.  20% off meal course from 3 to 5pm

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDODR2NGVREAE,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,Not the usual heartland western food. Serves (entry/mid level) restaurant quality meats and seafood (western style) for lower than restaurant prices. Heartland ambience. Definitely recommend the lobster and beef steak combo and the bottled Belgian white beer bucket.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdVp1WXBRRRAB,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,5,Nice food. Portion for set meal is way too big though..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazR2bm5BRRAB,Ling Maison,5,"<MUST TRY>

Ordered their Chicken Chop. Their portion size is generous. The chicken chop is tender and juicy. You can taste the fragrance of the black pepper when chewing in your mouth. The coleslaw is mild in taste and has a slight sour tinge to it. It is refreshing to have and does not overpower the main dish unlike most processed versions.

I was lucky and had the chance to speak to the owners. I understand that most of the side dish are made in-house (including the coleslaw that I had). I think it is quite rare for an eatery to make the side dish themselves. The coleslaw is thinly cut by hand and selectively chosen to ensure that only suitable parts are included. Had a great experience and will definitely visit again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNU15YmxRRRAB,Ling Maison,4,"Newly opened Little hidden gem here. Owners are very kind and humble and funny person. Mashed potato and coleslaw is a superb, fresh and own hand cut daily. Salmon is crispy at the skin but soft and juicy in the inner part. You can still feel the juice bursting in your mouth. The only wasted is the gravy, they put it on part of my favourite crispy salmon skin. The pork chop is very soft and tender, not oily and the portion is huge at only $8.90. But the homemade pepper sauce, I really wish I can take away only the gravy. I can already smell it once I collected. My eyes turned very big when I smelled. The fragrant is really addictive. Can feel they put a lot of effort in making it! Gonna try other dishes !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdVk3Yjd3RRAB,Ling Maison,5,"I first tried the pork chop from Ling Maison and thought the meat was tender. Sauce was a bit sweet for my liking but overall still nice. Took away the chicken chop for my mum who loved it as well. Look at that beautifully roasted skin! The following week, my parents went back for the salmon and chicken chop with pineapple. They absolutely loved it. I guess apart from the mains, what made ling maison stand out from other Western stalls in coffeeshop is their sides. They even have sous vide egg and red potato salad!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z2JPbnBnRRAB,Ling Maison,4,"This stall is newly opened. I only managed to try the Homemade Coleslaw and Cheese Tofu Fritters. I quite like the coleslaw.

=======

I came back two days after last visit, and ordered:
- sirloin steak
- salmon hollandaise
- sotongyaki

I changed the sides to coleslaw and potato salad. Coleslaw's standard is as good as last visit, and potato salad is nice too. For the steak, quite good for hawker standard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMkx2LV93RRAB,Ling Maison,5,"Chicken chop at $7.90 comes with two sides (I swopped fries for coleslaw). Very generous portion, meat was the perfect thickness, well seared and piping hot (I've had enough of lukewarm chicken chop precooked in bulk). Top that off with a cheery and friendly server and that gives you every reason for supporting this stall.

My picture doesn't do it justice (took in hurry as I was hungry) but I'd recommend those who are in the area to give it a try. Extensive menu choices and I'm sure you'll find something that catches your eye."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1anV1S0ZBEAE,Ling Maison,5,"Finally get to try the food after seeing so many good reviews. Tried the chicken chop and salmon oglio olio pasta. Indeed, the food taste great and especially the salmon pasta. Great customer service as well. Not crowded during dinner time and perfect for unwinding after a day's work."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHZpMjd3RRAB,Ling Maison,5,"Had the chicken chop. Being a chicken lover, this is one of the best I have had. Generous portion for less than $8, came with fries or mashed and garden salad or coleslaw. The meat was very tender and the black pepper sauce not oily or too salty. Must try, don’t come to Jackson Square just for noodle😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazh2eXBBRRAB,Ling Maison,5,"The mash potato is to-die-for.

The Salmon is fresh and the hollandaise sauce compliments it perfectly!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaTlENjlnRRAB,Ling Maison,5,"The Pork Chop marinate is NICE! Not the usual black pepper or mushroom. The salad was fresh and crunchy, nice sauce with sesame. Plus a generous portion of french fries. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
Fish & Chips was superb too! The fish fillet was good, it did not have the ugly fishy taste! Haha.
The staff were enthusiastic and smiley. They were extremely happy when we went up to them at the end of our meal to complement the food.
If they serve soup, it would have been PERFECT!
I will definitely come back to try other items, and bring friend when more can dine out.
Do check them out. It is good food at reasonable prices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbzlURHFnRRAB,Ling Maison,5,"Tried signature chicken chop. Rich taste of sweet and sour with a bit of peppery sauce. Chicken thigh meat was juicy and tender. Old school coleslaw and fries. For the portion, you got the value for money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUx1QmhnRRAB,Ling Maison,5,"Hidden at one corner in the cafeteria of Jackson Square, this is a rare gem and one which you want to keep for life (I'm not exaggerating). Try it and you will know the definition of value-for-money, which is somewhat an understatement. A more apt description might just be optimal consumer satisfaction for every cent incurred. Putting the heavenly food quality and generous portion aside, service standards by the cashier may likely put some restaurants out there to shame. If you are down to your last 10 bucks in life, you've gotta save it for this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbmRYTXhBRRAB,Ling Maison,5,Awesome food. Great serving. Must try Aglio Olio Pasta and their homemade coleslaw!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcFkyUUJREAE,Golden Rooster,1,I ordered chicken cutlet and requested to replace the side dish which was egg and coleslaw with fries. My another request was to add abit more tartar sauce. One of their staff called me and said that if I want extra tartar sauce he have to remove my fries for it and replace my fries with the tartar sauce! Never seen a restaurant so stingy with a condiment and wants to replace my side dish with a condiment.  I just received the food and there is no tartar sauce at all and the potatoes salad is horrible! Definitely won't be buying from here again

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeVktUjFRRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,4,"Need to wait 10-20mins for the buzzer to ring after making order. Always many people order from here. Good business. Somehow the plate is bigger than whats being served. Anyway i like their grilled fish, so give them 4 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMTVyMTVBRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,2,"Guys, just to update u 8.50 for chicken cutlet ya. So yup, not going back lol. Also cheapo auntie give 2 package chilli some more tell me i put the chilli inside alr ah haha. GL."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHQ3cnFnRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,2,"Affordable and good western food. This place is a bang for your buck. Highly recommended.

<EDIT> 20220520 - have dropped my rating of JWS Grille factory. standard has dropped. ordered a ribeye, but they served a sirloin. very disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDZ3VpX0Z3EAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,"Affordable and delicious sirloin steak at a coffee shop in Toa Payoh.
Will try their fried chicken the next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2emVUYkRBEAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,"Underrated stall, they deserve more stars. The pork loin was great, both my kids love it. The portion was juz nice for small eaters like my family. Steak was nicely grilled, char grilled chicken is still tender and juicy. Not forgetting to mention I had to walk a distance home and food still taste excellent. Don't take my words, go try it and review yourself."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0lPZEZnEAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,"Our favourite ""Western food"" place right now.   Well priced menu and appropriate expectations.   Big fan of the Pineapple or Hawaiian Chicken Chop carbonised like Han Solo, but in cheese."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdUpqQTJ3RRAB,JWS Grille Factory,3,Overall not bad. Fries so so.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMUlpSDB3RRAB,JWS Grille Factory,5,Love the chicken chop here. It has the grilled flavor that you don't get in other coffeeshop western stalls
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtXzktbUJBEAE,JWS Grille Factory,1,Fries and Onion rings were soggy and cold. Tried toasting in the oven and unable to turn crispy. Onion rings tasted weird like plastic. Chicken chop thick coated by bread crumbs
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbi1INndRRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,5,So tasty! Plenty of seats too. Good choice very nice service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteHEzMDl3RRAB,JWS Grille Factory,4,Affordable food and decently sized portions.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeGM3MVRBEAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,Very well priced western food with promo deals.. Liked the quality of food for that price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aU5Qc3FRRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,4,Nice food in shop house with no aircon. Price good because no additon GST and service charge. 😔
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNzlmeEdBEAE,JWS Grille Factory,4,"Customer service could be better, however food-wise, I'd give it a 7/10. Decent western food for a coffeshop under the HDB.

Be sure to try their Sweet Potato Fries, its one of my favorites from there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2E2WEFnEAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,"Good mince meat noodle, haha Yong tow hu"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjbUxIbm1BRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,1,"I give this place a 1 star because the food is really depressing , the fish and chicken are so small that it does not fill your stomach.Missing side dishes  like the onion rings which was supposed to be 4 per person actually was only 2! And the fries , alot but missing 1 packet , also found a piece of fries that was fried with some strings in it  which was gross. With the price of the fish costing 7.90 and getting such a small portion of it , i will rather eat burger king or macdonalds which is more worth it. I reco not to buy in bulk as they may give missing side dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpM3RhTlBnEAE,JWS Grille Factory,1,"Rude middle aged woman manning the store. Prepared the order for eat-in even though she asked twice and I’ve confirmed both times that it’s for takeaway. When I received my order and told her it’s for takeaway, she started scolding me, and told the kitchen folks that I “changed my mind again”.

She said, “if it’s really for takeaway, why did you accept my order pager?”

It was my first time at that store. Who would know that a pager is only meant for eat in?

Food wasn’t even good. Not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURra2NqamF3EAE,JWS Grille Factory,2,"Horrible service. I understand that the server doesn’t understand English. At least staff should have basic training to learn stall’s dish names. Nvm, so happen that a lady before me orders fish and chips, so I told the staff “same dish” in Chinese. After 15 mins of good wait, I was being served a chicken cutlet instead of fish. And the staff still insisted it is fish, despite it’s definitely chicken just by one look."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0aEkyMHp3RRAB,JWS Grille Factory,1,Ordered rib eye steak medium rare from this restaurant today. Got a seared steak with completely raw meat!!!! Could not eat the rest of the meal as I am not sure how fresh is the meat. Everything was horrible.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeC1uTTJnRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,1,"Food average, abit pricy. The staff who is taking order is super unfriendly. I wanted to change my order, the staff stare at me, show me black face and said cannot change because they have prepared my order already but i waited for 30 minutes still have not get my food. Dont even deserve 1 star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzZ1BlLW5RRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,2,"No fries came with the fish and chips that I ordered. The mashed potatoes were quite good, but everything else was adequate at best."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2c042OVdREAE,JWS Grille Factory,4,Steak is good for their price range but sides can improve standard.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM3ZHY1JREAE,JWS Grille Factory,5,Nice western food and options

And the fried mushroom, super yummy! Definitely prefer this place over Astons! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 and very cute robot waiter 🤩"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eU5pbV9nRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,5,"Good:
- Axsolutely amazing service. Staffs are helpful and helped us to communicate with the bowling staffs. There were some miscomm but the staffs were sincere in apologizing and even compensated us with free soup, drinks and 10% discount even though it was not entirely their fault.

- Food portion is just nice! Prices are reasonable and 25% off for SAFRA members!

- Very nice outdoor seatings with great view of the night sky.

- Great choice of sides for the mains including aglio Olio!

Bad:
- Aglio oilio is abit salty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybm9tX3JBRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,4,"Like the atmosphere and ambiance as its inside of temhr bowling centre.
Service crews were quite nice and polite.
Food wise, not bad. Beverage on quite high side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyX3RxU0NREAE,Axsolute Bistro,4,Brought my mum here for lunch few hours ago. The 2 gentleman that served us were very friendly and helpful. We had the 1 for 1 main meals promotion which was very worth it. Taste of the food was not bad actually so we are keen to return to try the rest of the food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldGJleXZBRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,5,"An excellent restaurant for the genre - located in a bowling alley, aimed at families, the food selection is fair, the portiin size very nice, the price is reasonable. Good for people who need baby chairs, too, which is a plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbjllNGhRRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,5,"My family enjoyed the experience. The waiter took time to explain about the food. Service was good enough especially Gary, Jason and Raj. I love the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNWZDM2lnRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,3,"Pizza is 5/10. Taste like those frozen one in the supermarket. If you are looking for a quiet place, look elsewhere. It is next to a bowl place so noise is inevitable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ME5iWDVRRRAB,Axsolute Bistro,4,"Nice outdoor chill out area. Food was reasonably priced (especially with SAFRA discount), albeit rather salty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdnB2dFp3EAE,Axsolute Bistro,5,"We decided to dine-in after picking the kids up from classes (adhering to 2 per table restrictions due to Covid restrictions). The Aglio Olio is very flavorful with a hint of lemon which makes it refreshing and not overly rich.
We also tried the Barramundi Fish & Chips and I loved it. The batter was very crispy and tasty. The fries were normal, but the best Barramundi fish I’ve had, I feel that they’re way better than some of the restaurants I’ve tried before."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXay1UTVJ3EAE,Axsolute Bistro,5,"Nice and cosy place to chill out. Food was great, reasonably priced and better than expected. Gary and team provided excellent service."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXel9IaUlREAE,Stall 7,4,Great western grill at toa payoh central. The shroom oglio aglio and cheese wedges must try when you are here. Coffeeshop is clean and well maintained too.

Chicken garlic pasta is good. The large calamari rings are crispy and nice as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd051aDVnRRAB,Stall 7,4,"One of the best ribeye steaks from a local western coffee shop stall one can find, grilled to your preferred doneness. Mine came medium, succulent and moist, and at $16.80, that’s pretty good value. Staff is friendly too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNmFuSjVRRRAB,Stall 7,4,"Chicken chop aglio olio:
Chicken was well seasoned and tasty. It was also grilled to perfection with just the right amount of charring. The aglio olio looked pale and unassuming, but it was packed with garlicky taste and was seasoned enough, without being  overly oily like a lot of coffee shop aglio olios. However, personally would have liked it to be spicier."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MnZEdkl3EAE,Stall 7,5,"A pleasant find at Toa Payoh. Juicy, succulent and well seasoned chicken chop. The charred garlic bits gave crunch and punch to the aglio olio. Excellent value for the quality."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdVBQcjRRRRAB,Stall 7,5,The guys at the stall at absolute Chads. Awesome food for a good price. Every other western stall in the area is average compared to this. Astons eat your heart out 💯
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeTZURnlnRRAB,Stall 7,4,"Good quality NZ ribeye steak at good price!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlck91bF9nRRAB,Stall 7,3,Ordered wild mushroom pasta in cream sauce. Mushroom was ok. Pasta texture was ok. But too much cheese added n it was crazy salty. Maybe I'll try something else next time or ask them to put less salt or not put cheese.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOEppSEVnEAE,Eday Western,4,"Recently ordered their fish and chip and grilled fish to try. Well I am quite impressed and it was quite good especially the grill fish that it was cooked well and has flavor with the brown sauce. Fish and chip is typical but both portion size may be small doe most people.

Ordered chicken spaghetti with cream sauce and spring chicken whole to try. The spaghetti noodle was well cook not too soft, chicken is bland like poach in water and throw into the spaghetti to cook. The cream sauce lacks flavor and not rich, a bit running. However the chicken was good, loved their crispy skin that is packed with flavours and not oily. Worth trying their fried spring chicken!"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcVlWNBAB,Eday Western,1,"Portion became smaller. Ordered chix cutlet rice. Few pieces of chicken on white rice.

Ordered 3 chicken wings. Overcooked with black patches.

I ordered before another lady. End up lady got the order before me.

Went to ask the cashier a male, how come take so long. Give me theory lesson that fried chicken wings takes longer to cook than fried fish.

Wow. Lor wonder my 3 pieces chicken wings was overcooked n had random black patches

Thanks not coming back. Service sucks like the food.

Those ordering from grab, its the same male chef cooking your sometimes under or overcooked fish/chicken. If a chef cant be consistent what he puts out, wonder how he survive so long."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMmRfZVZREAE,Eday Western,1,"Ordered two chicken chop sets, one with fries, the other with spaghetti, the one with spaghetti was supposed to come without sauce on the chicken chop. They managed to screw up BOTH ORDERS. Unfortunately only discovered the mistake after I arrived home."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta0p1UlpBEAE,Eday Western,1,"Super slow yet food nothing special. Cook was packing precooked spaghetti (horrible, they should be cooked fresh) into about 50 small bags for later use instead of spending time to preparing my order."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaUtDYU93EAE,Eday Western,4,Lot of varieties of western foods n Japanese like foods with a reasonable price... All rice come with a small bowl of a little diluted taste but overall it ok... Tried their pan fried fish with Japanese rice @ $4.80... fish is soft and well pan fried... Don't mind to come back again...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNmFEeFZ3EAE,Eday Western,5,Beef steak and chicken chop are delicious and the price surprisingly very affordable 😍🔥❤️ Yummmmmyy !! Best
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5d2R2NGZ3EAE,Eday Western,1,Chicken Chop + 1 x sausage for $7.50. Portion is small and don't taste that good. Not worth my moneu
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX3RQTlNnEAE,Eday Western,5,"Tried the pan fried fish (R3) with mushroom sauce. For the price of 4.8, this is really good with pearl/Japanese rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb1BUSFRnEAE,Eday Western,1,"Ordered from them on Grabfood and the food was not packed properly and the sauce spilled all over the bag. Not only so, I’ve topped up $3.80 for popcorn chicken and I received a pathetic little bag of it, on top of the the paper bag that contained the chicken was soaked in oil. I hope the restaurant would consider better packaging and to reconsider their portion sizes for some of their items."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX3ZYcEFREAE,Eday Western,5,"Tried the ribeye, chicken chop and half spring chicken. Reminds me of old-school tuckshop Western food. Spring chicken is crispy and juicy yet not oily. Haven't tried the other items but these are good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bC15NXNRRRAB,Eday Western,3,"I have been ordering through Grabfood many times. Can say their food is not consistent at all. Overall, their grilled fish is still passable, but both their mushroom soup and mash potato taste bad (really sour) and the garlic bread lacks flavour. Gotta improve on their side dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjc1lDdWxRRRAB,Eday Western,1,Just for 14Jun's order. We made an order today and found the batter for the fried fish n spaghetti too salty. Not sure if the spaghetti was boiled too long in salt water or the sauce over salted. Had to remove the batter from the dory fish for consumption. No issues with previous orders. Perhaps the cook could be more mindful. Thank you.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdDQ2OFRREAE,Eday Western,5,"I have been ordering from them via grab food multiple times. I always order the Ribeye Steak Set. Tbh for food court western, this really tastes delicious and the portions are sufficient.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5b19yVDNRRRAB,Eday Western,5,"All time fav for their pasta! (Aglio olio), cheap and affordable!

They also allowed to upsize your pasta portion which is great!

He gave me well done. When i tried to return the steak, he told me medium rare and medium well are the same. Steak was terribly tough. Black pepper sauce absolutely tasteless. The only saving grace was crispy fries and good portion of coleslaw. It was a nightmare. I ended up throwing half the steak and just eating fries and coleslaw for dinner."

Male staff cook come in front n confronted me. Saying, I shouldn't say his bad attitude.
Seem like looking for fight, it is very simple,  either u cook or don't cook.
Don't yells at me the customer. Upon picking of food. When ready. Don't even bother to call customer. Just throw there. Expected u known.

The food was quite tasty even though for some reason they always change my order due to having not enough stock on hand... especially the baked beans... Apparently no baked beans for the past week but its still listed in foodpanda...

Today i ordered again and the coleslaw tasted awful, very sour and presumably expired... I took the first bite and threw it away. The few times i ordered coleslaw from them, it tasted normal... but not today.

I hope that the restaurant does not keep food overnight and serve them to customers the next day... this poses a health risk.

I will probably still order from them again... but never the coleslaw after this event."

The soybeam milk and the You Tiao Man are awesome, it's the best I've tried since came to Singapore. The You Tiao Man has no butter flavor, and it's not like the others that it too much stuff, it tastes crisp out side but also light feel inside with a little salty. The boss said there's not so many people make You Tiao in the old way like him, I totally believe.
Astonishingly, the 88 congee was a little disappointed though a lot of people were in the queue. The congee is too thick, rice was not totally melted. Maybe I've tasted too much Cantonese style of congee, I would only give 3 star for this. The Teochew Handmade Pau was ok, I'll give it a 4 star, as it's just doing ok and the same as I tried in a Pau stall in Tiong Bahru. I didn't try the other famous ones like carrot cake, fried fish soap that day as they were not open. But all in all, a place worth to go again!"

Stores with constant queue were the roast meat store, main tauhuey store, hokkien mee store.

Ordered the famous carrot cake large size $4, took about 40mins. Not as nice as I recall and frankly even too salty, and this was after I had my other dishes. Wouldn’t have it again.

Had the large size $3.50 mee Siam, it was really good and I would be happy to have it again. Auntie squeezes the lime juice for you so you don’t have to do it yourself.

The tauhuey $1 was good but I didn’t prefer it. Though silky somehow I felt there was no more soybean taste. It felt like I was eating agarAgar or pudding…

Hokkien mee smallest size $5, was really good. It was flavorful, umami, good taste of lard without the porky taste. Chilli was not my fav but the base noodles itself was way too good already. Would have it again but it is a big portion for the smallest size.

Toapayoh HC is not bad. Was wondering why it was quite empty today but realised must have been because of the current covid cluster here . Lol…"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPak1yMk9BEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"Tried this outlet yesterday. It was almost empty during lunch time, very spacious.

The service staff who took our orders at the cashier had quite an attitude. She seemed irritated/ annoyed and was rude towards my friends even when they were very polite towards her.  She was impatient and got angry at one of my friends when he did not understand what she was saying (none of us could because she was not pronouncing the words properly/speaking up). She displayed an attitude when my friend went directly to select his choice of sides when he was ordering the double up chicken as did not know that he was allowed to choose the chicken. Oh btw there wasnt anyone behind us. This conduct is extremely turned off and uncalled for. As much as we try to understand why she is behaving this way, it is unfair for us customers to have to deal with her personal problems.

The food was affordable and tasted not bad. Chicken was tender, baked potatoes was not too hard unlike other outlets, quite nice.

The ambience would be very chill if its not for the two different songs playing in the background. One of it was probably playing from the speaker and the other one sounded like it came from the kitchen. Felt a bit uncomfortable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNUlPLW5BRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"Always love Aston’s for their affordable prices n good food. Will always order the steak with a glass of red wine. Now that it has become a halal establishment, no more alcohol is served. Nevertheless, the food is still great at that price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2FTN3lRRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"The queue is really long at dinner time because there's only one service staff taking order before you can get seated. The ribeye was overcooked and dry and some parts were fully burnt. Their sides were at least edible. Astons used to be known for being value for money, but their standard has dropped drastically. Not an exaggeration that I've had steak at coffee shops nicer than this, and a third of Astons price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaWJMdU53EAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,Food is good but sad they took out Snapple now. Side can be better. Side dish standard drop compare to last time.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZzZFdRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"The latte which looks like long kept lemon tea. And the char grill chicken, is over burnt chicken. The standard really drop a lot. Beside the steak and fish. Please to order the char grilled here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeDdyTG5BRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Had chargrilled chicken and 2 sides for lunch and it was an enjoyable meal. Chicken was tender and juicy while the baked potato was done right. Quiet place during weekdays for some me-time. No service charge and SAFRA members get 10% off.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWFiYWhRRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"They are short handed and staff stretched to the max but they still open up the entire place. End result is they have to rush like mad compromising customer service and food. I been to this outlet many times,  all I can say is they are on a slippery road down in terms of service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHN2FYZ2dBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"Located in SAFRA Toa Payoh.
Astons is the only other entity together with Superbowl bowling centre and Mcdonalds that have survived from day one it opened.
The premises is much bigger, compared to most other Astons restaurants and can seat at least 50.
Dishes here are of same standard as other Astons branches.
But somehow, they run out of FRIES on MONDAYS a lot of times.
Staff explained to me that their fries supply sell out over weekends and they are unable to get replenishment by Monday mornings.
Do take note of this and prepare to have other sides if you are coming on mondays!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHJHQVRREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"There is only 1 pathetic female staff manning a long queue of crowd at the cashier counter, taking orders, collecting payments and assigning/bringing customers to the table. It doesn't help that she is also very slow. The rest of the staffs and manager are either walking around, chatting and idling behind the beverage counter. It's very frustrating. There should be an extra staff helping to take the orders at the cashier during peak hours. Food is good and value for money but the staffs really need to be more efficient!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bGV1bEVBEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Great place to bring family for lunch or dinner fixed. Less crowded than the other outlets. The manager was very friendly and helpful enough to bring back to the kitchen to recook the steak that received raw initially.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTRxNXhRRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"Aston’s/Andes has always been a go-to place for good food at decent prices. However during my latest visit, I was made to queue for over 45 mins despite the restaurant being less than half full. Already quite annoyed, when I was finally seated at a table, I noticed that people who were at the front of the queue when I reached the place were already leaving, that’s how long the wait was. Food didn’t come for another 20-30 mins and when it did, the portion of food was disgustingly small and the wellness of the steak was nowhere close to the requested. Overall an overwhelmingly disappointing experience and very frustrating in terms of service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMl9PaDB3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"services:  i was regular at here but yesterday was first time that i and my family received very good services from the staff here her name was Hanah, she wearing tudung. Excellent.

Food: Excellent, thank to the chief for the excellent food that you offered.
i will come back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydXFpY0dREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Standard dropped a lot since the last time I visited. Ordered chicken cutlet and felt the meat tasted slightly weird. The inside was alittle pinkish. Informed the manager and he told me their chicken is supposed to be slightly pinkish on the inside due to the marinate they use. Gave him the benefit of a doubt and continued with my meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa0lITmFnEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"I had difficulty logging in to my Safra App however the waiter still provided me the discount.

Food portion was good and taste ok.

Newly renovated and it is brighter now.

Air conditioning was a bit cold for me though.

Overall was a good experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNUx5eHp3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"Service not that great. When asked for a glass of plain water, the first thing the waitress said is chargeable. We paid so much for the meal. It doesn't make sense if we can't afford for a glass of water. Need to train the staff how to communicate to customers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeFpQWlVBEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Went to eat nearing the closing time. The staff were still rather pleasant and courteous despite that.

The Chargrill and lemon chicken were good. The wedges and onion rings weren't fresh but expected since it was almost closing time.

Overall great experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ek1qNmdBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"I was in awe when Hui Ping, your full time staff at the counter told to write the product codes for the food in bigger letters next time, otherwise she is going to key in the wrong items for us. Basically, i am here at the counter with the chit paper, to confirm my orders before making payment. Next, she asked me to read out the drinks product codes to her since she could not read our order. Telling her the code name and she asked, what is CF2?? Isn't this the product code your restaurant decided upon for the beverages that you serve? You must be joking with me right? You do not even know or bother to check what code goes to what drinks as someone who is already a full timer? The way you speak to me makes me feel you are commanding your customer. What marvelous customer service you have.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMC1HQ3l3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"It was quite disappointing as the sides I ordered, the mash potatoes isn’t seasoned with butter or even salt, it just plain potatoes, the Mac and cheese has close to no salt either, likewise for the unseasoned chicken which they barely pass it off with a hickory bbq sauce. I didn’t remember Aston standards to be this low as it was a place that I would go to in my younger years. The standard of their food has certainly deteriorate over the years. Would not visit again, as western food from coffee shops would be better than this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnYyTDVBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Place is alright, unfortunately service is really poor. Tried to get the waiter’s attention but they ignored me despite making eye contact with me. Also, not sure why such establishments do not offer tap water? Wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t return in the future"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeW9MQVJnEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"ASTONS in Singapore is awesome! I always love the value for money. Their food is delicious, generous. Especially love their pasta salad! Yummy max. It's usually packed with people especially during weekend evenings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTlLVWpnRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Long queue despite restaurant being half full; queued more than an hour to be seated. Then waited another 40 mins for food to arrive. Standard of food has dropped. I have been a supporter of Aston's but not anymore after this experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMC11M1d3EAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,Restaurant was only half full on a Friday Lunch hour. Orders took 45 mins to arrive. Kitchen was extremely slow compared to other outlets. If you want to eat ASTONS suggest to patronise their other outlets.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZc1BTVXRnRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,A reasonable cut for the price you pay. It is probably not going to be the best steak you ever tasted but most likely not the worst too. Don’t get scared off the queue outside. They are just waiting to order before being seated. A good place to go for a family weekend dinner if you have always enjoyed the western food in hawker centre.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NFpmUUhREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"The place was packed.

Wedges tasted fresh, the steak and incrediburger were good.

The mac and cheese was so-so."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJc3JfOHRRRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,Decent steaks at affordable prices. I went with the ribeye extra cut which came with 2 sides (quite good value). Comparable with some of the steaks I've eaten in Australia. Plenty of seating available but you just order and pay before getting a seat. Good for groups and credit cards accepted.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXNPc3FBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,Was there with my 44th years primary school classmate. Love the ambience and the food was fabulous yet very affordable . Definitely highly recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRa1pUb05REAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,Decent western fare at economical prices. Most meals include 2 side dishes for you to choose. For an extra $5 they will throw in a large bottle of SNAPP juice and a soup with garlic bread. This outlet is always crowded at peak hours so it's good to come a little early. I enjoyed the thick lucious black pepper sauce slathered over the chicken chop which was peppery and appetising.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE9fOGt3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,5,"Consider cheap for western restaurant.
Average 1 plate about 10 dollar. Food is tasty. Service quite fast. Portion size is quite good.  Recommended to try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbzdMX3RBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"Another visit: another one of those promo dish.. Fried duck a la orange... Absolutely scrumptious. 😊

Revisit: The lamb ribs isn't so good anymore... Sad😭
The meat tasted dry n leathery.. Rkn consistency is an issue.

Previous review: Typically I'm not a big fan of Aston. I eat at this location because it's convenient and I can get Safra discount. Generally the grill meats and pasta are so so, with the grilled seafood somewhat better.

Occasionally Aston do deliver some special promo dishes that's a bit more appetitising than normal, and this is what caught my eye... Moroccan lamb short ribs. It was pleasantly surprise for me as usually they tend to overdo on the meats but this lamb ribs is really worthy to command 4 stars. Nicely  charred, with a thick layer of yummilicious fats over laying tender and juicy pink meat. Grilled to medium doneness, the taste of the pinkish meat is simply delectable with natural sweetness and a subtle tinge of Moroccan spices (could be heavier with the spices if I was the cook). Leave the pepper sauce alone. It's too heavy and will overwhelm the natural taste of the spiced lamb. I must have had my month's fill of charred lamb's fats at 1 sitting but heck, it's just melts in your mouth. Too tempting to resist..Yolo😁, will take a couple of motilum when I get home.  😆

As a purchase with purchase, I opted for the escargot baked in garlic/olive oil. That's brilliant too. Aston shd seriously consider make this lamb ribs a permanent part on their menu. I'll definitely patronise more frequently. At $19.90 a pop, this lamb ribs is great deal! 👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcXEzaGJREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,Taste ok. Fried chicken taste quite good. Lamb chop was a bit disappointing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeWNuWTVBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"Menu (halal) is quite limited. Set lunch or dinner reasonably priced. Service is good though slow. Cosy ambience. Good for small gathering, family. Those without own transport may find it quite inconvenient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMV96X1NnEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"• SLOW: Using a pre-pay system where one very slow server took the orders of the entire queue outside. The restaurant was empty but they were just that slow to seat people.
• Kitchen was also very slow getting food out even though the number of customers weren’t that many.
• NEW CHANGES: Ever since the revamp, food portions have gotten smaller but more expensive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPci1ycUVREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,I'm disappointed with my lunch at Aston in tao payoh safra. Is cold when they serve the steak. Is so hard. After hv the food there came home hv diarrhoea. This is going to be my last time going there.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneS02bFlREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,Reasonable priced and value for money. Yummy food too. But the cleanliness is a bit...... ? Went to get our own utensils and realised that the forks and spoons were all very dirty looking and stained. We asked for disposable forks and spoons instead.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2JhZWtnRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Service attitude was poor, after waiting for more than 30 minutes order has not arrive. Asked their staff about our order and was ignored."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc2JfdHl3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"A tad bit dark - but in line with the theme of its American linkage. Food portions are smaller than I used to remember but prices are reasonable. If you are a SAFRA member, 10% discount awaits.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3aVllb3lBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,Food is nice and usual Aston's relatively high and consistent quality. However restaurant ambient is really dark and gloomy. Nice for dinner but not good for lunch....as it makes you wonder if its lunch or dinner due to the extremely dark environment with dim lightings.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMF9TdlFREAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Ordered fiery chicken with garden veggies(boiled) and fries.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM2RhcU93EAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,Always a great deal and the food quality is consistent across the chain in Singapore.  What's even better is SAFRA members get a 7% discount at this outlet.  Sub SGD10 for a decent main (with the discount) is a good deal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMXFTSXh3RRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,4,"It's the decent steak house in Singapore. Nothing spectacular but the char grill chicken is always good and steak often get done a bit too much. The sides are good for kids with Mac and cheese, onion rings and pasta salad. The tasty rice is surprisingly flavorful so try that if you want some rice. One thing bad is that you need to pay for water."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbDhHVTVBRRAB,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,3,"I didn't get the name of the lady who was fronting customers at cashier. But I wanted give kudos for her patient and customer-oriented service. Other than Fiery Chicken, there were no other chickens available. Also no fish no that. I wonder how Astons Toa Payoh do business. But the lady kept running in and out, in to take order, while out to inform customers in queue the unavailable items. I would give all my 5 stars to the lady but none to the branch manager."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdjVPUVJnEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,2,"Reasonable price but lacks the freshness I used to love about the place. Seems like a lot of pre-prepared food & sauces. Very automated customer service. Potato salad was bad, bit into raw pieces. Mac & cheese was not good. I had lemon-lime grilled chicken that lacked flavor. All I tasted was the sauce poured over it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVanFpLVVBEAE,ANDES by ASTONS @ SAFRA Toa Payoh,1,"Bad food, fries were reheated without the normal seasoning, ordered the fried chicken and the flour covering the chicken was burnt. Oil was dripping from the chicken. Wouldn't recommend."

Went there during their weekday brunch so it was $9.90 for the mains and you can add on for the soup of the day and drinks. Food tasted quite ok given the price, though the pasta could be a bit more seasoned or flavourful at it tasted just like cream. The chicken in the pasta was instead quite salty. The sauce for the dory was quite similar to the cream pasta but i goes well and i enjoyed that.

Thumbs up for their desserts as their waffles were so good!!  The ice cream was good too and generous serving. All that for $12!

They use an online order system so you will have to order and pay online.

Overall a pleasant experience and will be back for their waffles again!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyczZUQ3FBRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"Cozy place with friendly staff. Quickly seated on a weekday dinner. Back a couple of times to try out different dishes.

My son likes the ribs. Nicely done for a wallet friendly price. Fish was yummy too.

Today, we tried butter chicken burger and seafood aglio olio. Will be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybGVqY0R3EAE,The Larder Cafe,4,"Waffle is freshly made, nice and crunchy

Pork ribs portion is huge and the meat came off the bones easily. Chicken chop portion is small taste very average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3B5RkFREAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"decent cafe
Price slightly on the high side but still ok
Food is good but salmon set, portion slightly too small
Recommendation: Double Chocolate Brownie, Big Breakfast n the tea series"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbFo3LVd3EAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"One of our favourite joints. The lamb shank just falls off the bone, I didn't even need to use my knife! We must have the emperor's fingers side every time. Wife got her usual salmon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMXBmaG9BRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"Ordered the Pan Seared Barramundi, sweet potato fries, truffle fries, chicken meatballs.

My main was pretty well prepared, side dishes are alright in my opinion. Meatballs were quite salty but this is subjective.

Staff were friendly and efficient!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb0xya0RBEAE,The Larder Cafe,4,"Service :4 stars
Food: 3.5 stars
- the sausage veggie was too oily. You can see from the plate the abdundunt oil left.
-the kids beef burger is quite good though.
Value for money :4 stars"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNkp1QnV3RRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,Nice neighborhood cafe with a wide variety. The cafe is quite spacious. The food were good and the staff efficient and polite
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd0pIZldnEAE,The Larder Cafe,4,Came here twice. Price is good and food is nice. Came once for lunch and once just for coffee. Found my favourite fresh milk with coffee ice cubes here. Will definitely return to eat again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXRUY2lBRRAB,The Larder Cafe,3,"Nice ambience cafe. Staff service is good. Ordered the creamy chicken spaghetti. Chicken is salty, noodle creamy yet a bit plain. Maybe will try other food next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOWFYQVpBEAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"5 stars for the friendly service. Like the cosy environment too. tried the duck confit tender meat but overall its too salty for me. The pork redeye on the other hand is delicious though.
It is a place you don't mind to say ' I'll be back'
😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdFlHOUd3EAE,The Larder Cafe,4,Nice cafe concept eatery place in a hdb shophouse. Friendly and helpful service crew. Prices on the ex side though.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OXJZVxAB,The Larder Cafe,4,Not bad their sweet potato fries was good. Spinach soup reminded me of Jack's Place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtN0x2TEtBEAE,The Larder Cafe,3,"Below expectations. Food was very oily and portion was little. Sausage Aglio - 5/10, oily, salty, unimpressive.

Creamy chicken pasta - extremely creamy, overwhelming, bad @ 2/10.

Price - your usual neighbourhood café price but high for food quality

Café was noisy, not for chilling  people!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOS1hVkJnEAE,The Larder Cafe,4,"Nice variety of food menu at an acceptable pricing. Place Is medium. Got inside and outside seats. Service was okay.
Aircon is okay.
Got deserts and ice cream.

Carbonara was decent but could be better.
Teriyaki chicken thin crust pizza was tasty.
Iced cubes espresso latte was alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLXF5VC1nRRAB,The Larder Cafe,3,"Price is alright, food is average.
Tried their truffle chicken and pork ribs, both are quite dry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxckpLRm5RRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,Nice little restaurant at Toa Payoh. They seem to have a good crowd during dinner time. There wasn’t any queue when I got there around 7pm and there was a table available soon. The food is tasty but the portion is too small for a main. Service is excellent and the stuffs are all polite to the customers.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcnF1S1lBEAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"Found this cafe through Google search and it was the 1st one that came up for ""best eats near Toa Payoh mrt"".. Cafe was located on the other side of Toa Payoh mall, so might need to walk abit to find it if you are not familiar with the area. Cafe was almost full on a Sunday afternoon at about 1pm and more people came after us. Indoor and outdoor seatings available. Food ordering and payment was through online, quick and efficient. Waiting time for the food was surprisingly quick, less than 10mins. Wide variety of western cuisine and desserts & beverages. Food was good and service was good too, staff were all friendly. No gst or service charge. Nice place to visit if you are in Toa Payoh area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamRXWU1BEAE,The Larder Cafe,5,The food was so good.. Forgot to take photos 😂. Reasonably priced good food and desserts!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnblBUNkxREAE,The Larder Cafe,1,"Ordered (as pickup) from food panda many times

Today (29 april 2022)
i ordered truffle fries and the fries were re-fried so many times, the inside is hard. Never ordering again.
————————————
2nd time in here, first time was when they’ve just opened(bought a dry cake), so giving them a chance since a lot of reviews say food is nice. Coffee wasn’t bitter, just had a slight tinge of sourness (I don’t add sugar to my flat white), food tasted good. Lunch for 2 mains with one soup and drink was $30 (rounded up)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMFBuZk5REAE,The Larder Cafe,5,Really nice surprise to stumble upon this place. Foods yummy and reasonably price
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaXRERGhBRRAB,The Larder Cafe,2,"Decided to try this place because of its reviews. Although the food is pretty decent, I found a total of 3 stands of hair inside my husband and my food. Needless to say I didn't finish my food. The waiter took away our food and acted dumbfounded. No apologies, no service recovery. Nothing. Not that all these matters... but sigh. Simply disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnFHNXp3RRAB,The Larder Cafe,1,"This place is absolute trash. Waste of money for what they provide. 3 tiny slices of toast for a dish meant for 2? I'm supposed to split the 3rd one down the middle? $28 for an anemic excuse of a steak?
Sausage platter is straight off the frozen meats section at NUTC. Quick pop in the air fryer and on to your table. Bland and boring.
Amazingly, its crowded, proving once again that us Singaporeans will support absolutely any terrible place, so long as it's accessible. I mean, that's why I came down.

Save your money and go to a better place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN3UzLW5nRRAB,The Larder Cafe,3,Nice place to have a good meal.  The price is ok.  There have some nice meals there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbEtHMjF3RRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"Quite recommendable place for lunch or dinner. Overall food is good but there,s improvement to be made on the food taste. Especially for the pork rib eye abit too salty. Anyway great job on food presentation. Will come back again to see any improvement on the taste 😄😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5N1lLMWR3EAE,The Larder Cafe,3,"Hidden away from the main alley of Toa Payoh Central, this cafe served quite a wide range of western dishes, pasta, pizza, steak, lamb, dessert, ice cream and even beers! Tried their lamb shank, the meat is really tender and fall of the bone but it still have the gamey taste of the lamb. Thought it would have more spice mask it. The mash potatoe lack flavour and not smooth. The sweet potato fries is a bit too thin but it is crispy. The service is fast even for the lamb dish!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OGEyZkt3EAE,The Larder Cafe,4,"110321 Impromptu TGIT dinner with ❤️ @ The Larder Cafe, had baked escargots, grilled buttermilk chicken and Black Mama Pork Burger (What a name for a Charcoal Bun burger!)

Osmanthus Latte was somehow a bit of a disappointment with a hint of the flavoured taste, but promptly covered by the heavy coffee flavour, despite being a milk-based latte drink.

Still a good dining place to try out overall !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bktQbTdRRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"Tucked away at a corner of Toa Payoh central Larder Cafe offers nice juicy burgers for meat lovers. Good size dining space with approx 12 tables catering to different group sizes. Online Menu, Food Order & payment online, great for tech savvy people, and food was delivered promptly. Overall nice place to have a quick bite and fast service. Thumbs up!
Cons: Wafer ice cream dessert took quite awhile to be serve though. No free water."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNHVfbndBRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,Good place for gathering n enjoying delicious food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LTdLZUdREAE,The Larder Cafe,5,The most interested one is Waffles Ice Cream and Pizza.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOVBtWjBRRRAB,The Larder Cafe,3,"Ambience is alright, has a tacky industrial look. Menu is really quite extensive and includes a whole range of ice cream flavors but I only tried the coffee.

Got a long black and a flat white and when the drinks came, I could not tell them apart because there was that little foam in the flat white. Their coffees do not come with latte art, just milk dumped into the espresso shot. Taste is not too bad but the there is a lot of room for improvement wrt the texturing of milk.

Cannot comment on the service as we ordered through the phone app instead of at the cashier."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cjZ6UkN3EAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"Their duck confit had perfectly crispy skin and mouth watering meat below, accompanied with fresh rocket and tomatoes.

The mushroom truffle gratin was also amazing from the first bite to the last, filled with creamy yumminess.

I'll back to try their pizza, burgers, and other mains!

Sorry ate too fast before I could take photos :P"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdk9UbU5nEAE,The Larder Cafe,4,"Visited during lunch time on Saturday, restaurant was about half filled, staff were warm and friendly. Food were good but nothing spectacular, price was reasonable for most of the menu. Great place for gathering as their table can be easily rearrange for more seatings of 10 pax easily and wasn't too noisy for chatting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbG9Uenp3RRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"Has both indoor and outdoor seating. Reservations recommended if you want indoor seating.
Pork ribs were tender and well marinated. Sweet potato fries not bad; has a abit of a crisp.
Arrabbiata Linguine is pretty spicy (fair warning)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb0pUZkRBEAE,The Larder Cafe,5,"Very nice pork ribs and pork burger! Pork ribs are tender and flavourful! Love the fries too! Crispy and crunchy!

Lavender honey ice cream is very nice! Lavender smell very strong and not too sweet. Charcoal Waffle is crispy too!

Good service too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpajl2TXlRRRAB,The Larder Cafe,5,"When you crave for something and it’s just around the corner.😋🌸Have you ever visited The Larder? If not yet, then it’s time for you to explore..3-5 minutes walk from Toa Payoh Mrt,you gonna love the place,the food are amazing,the ambiance is cozy. I really love to come here and bring my friends to try every dish they have. Just so love to spend time with friends here and having a brunch. The price are affordable with easy access of their menu. Btw they are using QR menu as well,it is fast and easy to order. Highly Recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NXE2bVhREAE,The Larder Cafe,1,"Waited for 30min for a table of 2 on wed night. Some food already out of stock. Had mushroom aglio and buttermilk chicken.
Mushroom aglio is real bad. Tasteless and funghi taste is too heavy. Told the staff about it, she nicely replaced a new one. But it still taste worse than home cook. It’s $14+ for. Small plate.
Chicken was salty and falling out by bits and pieces. Don’t wan even need to use knife.
Left. Hungry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczVpYzJnRRAB,The Larder Cafe,5,Yummy food! Recommend the charcoal waffles and their triple chocolate ice cream!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMm9QLUZ3EAE,The Larder Cafe,2,"Food was a hit or miss depending on the dish you order. My table ordered pork ribs (was quite decent), mushroom truffle pasta (good), teriyaki chicken pizza (meh - the mayonnaise overwhelmed the entire pizza), caesar salad (so-so).

What was not great was the service. One of the waitstaff who is clearly a butch has a really poor attitude and for some reason was just rude to me simply because I was a guy. Could not greet customers properly, and talk decently. My entire dinner was ruined simply because of the way she behaved and spoke. Could tell she was biased because she treated her other butch customers with such kindness and courtesy, but not to others sadly.

NOT RECOMMENDED!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTZ3ZXUnhBRRAB,The Larder Cafe,4,"I like the Truffle Mushroom Melt and the salad is very fresh. I recommend the sweet potatoe fries. Many place couldn't achieve the crispy or it will become soggy very fast. But here the fries is nicely done, no fancy seasonibg just true skill & true taste of the sweet potato.

Osmanthus latte is too sweet for me. Has ordered for less sweet but myself still find it sweet. Seem to me like Osmanthus honey in latte. Personal opinion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwekplbVN3EAE,The Larder Cafe,3,"Cafe located in toa Payoh central. Decent selection of food, taste is not bad but a little pricey. Food takes quite long to be served. Interesting ice cream flavours available here. Cash, nets or grab pay payment only. Unique decorations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanB6MnZnRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"Tucked away on the 2nd floor, this place offers a wide variety of cuisines from Indian to Western and Korean.

This place also has a cloud kitchen that allows you to order and pickup certain food easily via their lockers but is however strictly for takeaways."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxM1lyM3lBRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,It's good that they are starting to get more footfall in this quiet food court. They have also expanded into a central kitchen that houses various brands like king of fried rice & Texas chicken. Will also recommend the Korean don at gogiyo. Their teriyaki salmon don is really fresh and the serving is huge!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHNHSThnRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Unique foodcourt with lotsa beer options, great tze char and western (Fatty Bom Bom) food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdFo3bWt3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Place has gone thru some reno, and signs of more reno being done, with the addition of some new shops. Today ordered food from Ya Long. Not disappointed. The white beehoon, veg dishes were all so good. Definitely will visit again to check out the new stores"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMWZYc3JRRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,Nicely decorated in an industrial theme aptly because this is located in an industrial building. Huge variety of beer and drinks at an affordable price. Great for large gatherings and family dinners. Good array of other eateries in the same food court. Parking could be challenging though. Advice to come outside of peak period to avoid the massive crowd during lunch.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxN05PVzZBRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"Select Group Cloud Kitchen opened within Grains & Hops on 29 May 2021, at #02-01. Basically they took up 4 stall space and offer delivery/takeaway for 7 brands (see pictures for brands available).

Ordering can be done through the 2 kiosks available, payment only by Nets. For customers who may need help, there is a counter where you can place order with staff but payment also by Nets only.

Once order is ready (you can order from any combination of stalls), you will get a receipt with a number, look out for your number on display and then collect from the numbered locker.

How to get there: bus stop after mosque along Braddell Road, just in front of Blk 978 Toa Payoh North building. Grain & Hop is on level 2, access by escalator (see picture).

If driving, you can park at the MSCP within blk 978, as open air car park mainly for season (but on Sunday quite empty). Alternative is to park at Blk 199 Toa Payoh North open air carpark just behind the industrial estate, short 5 min walk.

Enjoy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeW9HMDRRRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Located at level 2, and you can only access it via 1 escalator, nowhere else.
Not very accessible, though there is a nearby bus stop.
Well decorated place with many food stalls. It's a food court with aircon selling food from many cuisines and the place is huge!
Tze char, western, korean cuisine, army stew/mookata, drinks.
At the back of the place, the drinks stall sells snacks and many beers! They seem affordable!
Came here for Gogiyo, but might come again for other stalls"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eUxiRVpBEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Generous portions from Fatty Bom Bom. Ordered the chicken cutlet and chicken chop. Find it a bit greesy but generally decent Western food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3cE5iaDB3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"Tl;dr: Peaceful oasis for lunch, good food selection, good cooking! 😋👍

Review: Went for a slightly early lunch, Comfortable place, food was good.  Lunch crowd started coming in when we finished, but generally still quite peaceful compared to other lunch spots."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHVxQzN3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,1,"Super upset and angry with the drink stall chinese lady. Paid $34.80 for my drinks but the actual bill was $22.60 because they forgotten about there was a discount for the beer. Just because i use OCBC paynow, the chinese lady said they cannot refund me in cash of the differences but ask me to buy drinks from the stall instead. I insisted for the difference and she keep refusing until the guy from the zi char stall came by to help and told the chinese lady to refund me in cash. And i told the zi char guy that’s what i ask for and the chinese lady suddenly came to me and change her story and say (in chinese) “ is not that i don’t want to give you back the difference, but i was just trying to explain to you.” This chinese lady super good at twisting her story! Was really fuming 😤"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxbktHcV93RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Amazing cloud concept chicken so you can get food from various estabs all in one place! There’s Lerk Thai, Pho Street, newly opened King of Fried Rice, Niigata, Hill Street Coffee Shop and Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert. Air conditioned waiting area makes the long wait bearable in the tropical summer heat. You also collect your orders in a contactless manner. Great concept and great first encounter with a cloud kitchen!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcnNlZzVBRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Nice modern bistro with variety of stalls to select and share among friends or family. There are rounds tables suitable for gatherings and chill over wide selection of beers.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNWVtQ0tREAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Food was good. Ambience was ok. Accessible as there is a bustop just outside the place. Must try the chicken cutlet rice. My fav in the menu so far.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOFBPbWZBEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,2,"The selection and quality of this place is decent. But the service is horrendous. They sell a variety of beers but the drink stall helper has no idea what the beers are and blames it on the customer that they should communicate in Mandarin whereas all the menu items are in English. Even when taking orders for coffee and tea, the person in charge could not apprehend just 2 simple orders. It is okay to have the lack of knowledge, but the attitude to put her lack of on the customer is unacceptable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcHZfM253RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,good beer promo and delicious food at Yalong Bay. have to order their specialty fire chicken
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla2NEV3dnRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Love the beers... Loads of options
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX2NlY09BEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Nice and cosy. Limited choices for food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aF9Xb0pnEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,3,Ate spicy chicken Japchae. Not spicy at all. A bit salty to my taste bud.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHBuXzJRRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Fatty boom boom have consistently great taste, fried rice king offer great fried rice you can ask for .. superb"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMkxLUWl3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Enjoyed the zhi char stall especially their fishhead curry, salted egg chicken and claypot brinjal. The place is air-conditioned with high ceiling. For beer lovers, there's great selection there at reasonable price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdi0tVUh3EAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,1,"Was at their woodlands outlet. The can drinks are not chilled and they only provide a cup of ice per can. And on a hot day, if the ice has melted before you can finish the drink, the drinks stall will not give you more ice nor sell you ice. Probably the first time encountering such incident. So best is don’t drink or be prepared for drinks not chilled."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eTdmTEh3EAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"It's a nice place to have lunch or dinner, only because it is air conditioned, parking is super convenient, and not many people truly know of this place yet. It's very cool how they have so many different types of craft beers on display, and how the prices are much more reasonable compared to the bars and pubs we know. The food here is also very well curated, whether it is the tse char stall, the western food, or the malay Muslim food stall. Quite impressed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbF9qUEZREAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,Nice Zhi char food. Good for big group
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdXFMaWtBRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,3,"Air conditioned food court with mookata and beer options. Beer is cash only, so bring some along. Social distancing is minimal, plus some people working there don't really put on their masks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTc3RQVmN3EAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"Pretty busy place on a weekend night. Good variety of local favourite foods like zi char, Indian Muslim, Western grill and Korean Army Stew, supported by a well-stocked beer fridge."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNrMU5IaU9BEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"Air-conditioned and have a big variety of beer selections.  Food selection is good. Indian booth is popular choice, while most Chinese sample the flaming duck. Western booth is ok but takes forever to cook."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0ak42M1lnEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"The so called famous chicken is average tasting to me. I guess the wow factor for most pple was the flames. The zichar stall serves decent food.

Beer bundle deals are good. Great place to gather with friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneS1INnpBRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,3,"Service of Yalong Bay is good and staff are approachable and friendly as well. Reservation is also allowed. However, the food is not as tasty. The lala Hor fun supposed to be popular tasted starchy. The prawn paste chicken wings and deer meat with onion were also not tasty as those we took in other coffee shops. The burning chicken, we didn’t get to try as needs to call for reservation one day in advance. Other shops, the western food took 40 mins to serve our orders but didn’t taste good either. Either over fried or oily. Kids couldn’t finish it at all. On TOP of that, the place is very hot although the aircon is on. Only attention is the beer pricing.. 5 of bottles for $30 - $35"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGN1TGl3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Cosy place but pricing can be cheaper for such a place....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxN09QWnV3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,Lovely place to dine in. Great selection of Asian cuisines at affordable prices. Cooling place but gets a little stuff though bearable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcV9Yak93EAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,3,Haha thought this was a bistro but turned out to be a seafood foodcourt with zhi cha stalls and a row of kebab and western food. Went on a Saturday evening and place had a big turned out of customer. Ended a bit disappointed as was hoping to have a quiet place to dine. Food also took >30mins to serve.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMmJmakl3EAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,"This is one of those hipster coffee shops, located in the middle of nowhere, selling good food and providing good ambience. The tse char stall here Yalong Bay is pretty decent, and the coffeeshop has a very impressive collection of craft beers that are very well priced, especially in bulk. Imported San Miguel will go for 35 for 10 bottles - that's how attractive it can go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2a0tlTFdnEAE,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,2,Not many stalls are opened. Price are consider high as this is only canteen to foodcourt environment. Not really worth.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMDdEQXJRRRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,5,"Food at Yalong Zhicar is nice. Good to go in group of 4 - 6 pax to share their La la Hor Fun. Those who like La la should try this because they are generous with the la la . They also have 'Fire' Chicken ...very unique way of eating, should try this also but need to order 1 day in advance. This place is crowded at night even on a weekday night."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMjYzU3B3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,4,Some good food. Mainly good for the cheap and wide variety of beer. But closes quite early (9pm) and does not have many options for breakfast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNXRXdGl3RRAB,Grains & Hops Food Court Bistro,2,"King of Fried Rice disappointing.
Rice did not have any flavour and even though it smells nice, the rice is completely bland and not worthy of a trip there."
