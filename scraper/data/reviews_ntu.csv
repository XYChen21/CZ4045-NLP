ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaWZtS2NnEAE,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,4,"I happened to walk into this coffeeshop and noticed this stall in the extreme left corner.

From their menu, I decided to have lontong as it has been a long while since I last ate.

I was expecting the usual bland lontong, but was pleasantly surprised by their lontong.

The rice cake was nice and firm enough without it being too soft and lumpy.  The piece of tofu was fried nicely, soft inside but firm on the outside.

The lontong gravy was also very flavorful, and when mixed with their sambal, it turned out to be a very good combination.

Overall this would be amongst the top 3 lontongs that I have eaten in SG.

Definitely worth trying their other dishes the next time I am in this coffee shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d0pxZkNREAE,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,5,"Truly an iconic stall in the west. Be sure to get your breakfast here.

Nasi sambal goreng was really nice. Serunding and sambal were sweet but that’s ok."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcnRSaBAB,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,1,"Today i bougth 2 pkt chicken frm jurong west st 91 its was so saltish tat we cannot even eat it.
End we throw the both pkts.
Plssss taste before serving customer in future.
We are not get it fr free.
$9 is also a hard money fr us.
Plsssss take note ya."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTdQZXhRRRAB,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,5,"Tried their kway teow grg, lontong kering, nasi grg kampong, all so nice! My fav malay stall in jurong west so far! Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGVxRFNBEAE,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,4,Good and authentic Malay dishes. The sambal goreng is really nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxa1piT3B3RRAB,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,2,"Ordered chicken rice the other day from this stall and it was subpar, portion was small and for $4 I expected to be a little bit more filled. Hence the rating"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjb19fVzVnRRAB,Asia Ghani Malay Stall,5,I tried their Nasi Sambal Goreng from Foodpanda and it was really good! Sambal was more on the spicy side but i can tahan spicy so !!! Will try their other food in future!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dkt2czBnRRAB,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,"Bought curry chicken with rice for takeaway, it’s tasty and good. Reminds me of childhood. But it’s too spicy, I wish they would tone down the spice. Quick and efficient order taking and service. Their other dishes also look delicious. $6.50 is a bit high for coffeeshop standard but the quality is there. Adequate portions. Will come back and try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaTlqYTR3RRAB,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,"First time trying their zi char and I would say that service and food are both relatively above average.

There are a few order takers so you will never be neglected, unless there’s a huge crowd who wants their order taken at the same time.

Upon ordering, the food came out in less than 10 minutes. This amazed me as I expected to wait for about 10-15 minutes.

Food is well seasoned and relatively fresh, given that they are always very crowded every night and opens till quite late at night for the supper crowd. The food is tasty even though it is halal.

A lot of seatings and turnaround is fast, so don’t have to worry there’s no seats.

Plus, the tables are clean compared to a lot of coffee shops.

Will definitely come back again to try their seafood fried rice as I saw a few who came to packet seafood fried rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbDdtb093EAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,5,"Seldom being there, unless we do visiting, the place was clean, well managed, there's a lady to check all your entry. The foods was good and the service was excellent, more choice, the price was reasonable too. Hope to be there again soon. The stall is inside Teh Tarik Eating House at blk 456 Jurong West. Thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdnUtd293RRAB,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,Food was nice and good. Nice serving portion. Good spread. They have sets. Staff was friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc0xXZ2FnEAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,1,"Order fried bee hoon without taugeh but still put taugeh & order sambal fried rice & nasi goreng kampung didn't mention never put vege but came very with vege.
Nasi goreng kampung taste like normal fried rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjXzlETGRBEAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,5,"Trying for the first time, should say that I was really impress by the taste and quality of food. Will definetly go back in future."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHay03YU5REAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,1,"Ordered salted egg crab on Nov 8 at past 10pm thru Foodpanda @ $50+ for a piece. The crab was depressing, I hardly ate any crab meat.  meat was mushy and solid, not firm and springy.  Meat was sticking to the shell, the main shell itself had nothing.  When your eatery/restaurant has ""seafood"" on it, pls live up to it!  The food that came is just $5 worth or less for the salted egg gravy which was so so.  I was scammed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOXNyQ0dREAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,Did not order any food from them but I've ordered in the past and food is not too bad either. Their service quite fast. Not bad.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdzRtclRBEAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,1,Bad experience ordering from foodpanda with this restaurant. Suppose to arrive at 1115 but waited until 12 am with no update from restaurants itself or foodpanda Last and never gonna order from them again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cjRPdlp3EAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,5,"Fast service and taste of food served is consistently good. Special mention for Thai honey chicken wings, kuayteow goreng, salted egg dishes and the chyesim soup with salted egg.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhM0tTMElBEAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,"The food was delicious especially from the cfud stall , seating arrangement sufficient , clean and well ventilated dining space
Only the drinks prices were overpriced compared to other eating outlets"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dTVIT2VBEAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,3,"Food is good but the price?
Hefty and expensive.For someone who is making business here,getting twice of the price that they are able to get compared to when they are making business in their own country is fair enough but when prices ranging from $5+ onwards just for a meal,it is quite pricey I would say."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHclotVXJnRRAB,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,I find the portion is big if you eat there compare to packet..price reasonable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHZ2VHOFd3EAE,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,4,Had been coming here for quite a few times. Service here here is good . food taste great and the staff is friendly.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbzhuX3NBRRAB,Sinar 456 Malay Seafood,2,"Bought $13 sweet and sour chicken through foodpanda, and the amount given worth less than $5. If i knew i rather buy the rice set that they give more chicken."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPME9xMHF3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"Good selection of stalls from dessert, soup, rice and noodle dishes, rojak, popiah, etc.

Plenty of tables and quite clean.

Tried the popiah and it's alright, the green bean/sago soup and ice kachang are pretty good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLU1PYU93EAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,2,"This is not a review of all the stalls in general, but one specific dessert stall here.   For $1.80, the portion is not only small, the bowl used is so shallow - totally not worth the price.  All water & not much barley nor bean curd skin.  If not for the ‘ok’ taste, I would give it a one star.  Not worth another visit / patronage."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybDZfS29RRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"A very healthy choice of Yong Tau Fong here.  Soup is not overly salty but sufficiently savory to the taste bug. 👍🏻👍🏻

My second visit with 3 pax. We tried out the char pot rice, KL Hokkien mee and last the oyster omelette. The best I liked is the oyster    omelette. Each bite of it comes with a flavorful taste. The stall selling both the oyster omelette and pork noodle. So do expect some waiting time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbk9mQUFnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,3,Nice but abit salty and oily. Price abit expensive too. Only 5 pcs with noodle costs $7 per bowl.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHektuNllBEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"The Penang-style charkoayteow is recommended here. Altho fried five plates each time, the koayteow has sufficient 'heat', 2 prawns and egg for a tasty treat. Only missing the cockles and Chinese sausage for an authentic Penang rendition. However, the place lacks sufficient seats so may have to stand around while a diner finishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOU9yM2tRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"Asked for extra pork lard for my wanton noodle, the stall assistant proceed to give me a 10min lecture of how expensive pork lard is and I have to pay extra $0.50, which is a very small amount as $0.50 cannot even buy bread nowadays.

Attached photo of a Ba Chor Mee I bought elsewhere with extra pork lard, no extra charges required.

Seems like Malaysia boleh not boleh already"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanU3ZnFBRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,Penang Fried kuay teow is the dry type with no heavy dark sauce. A little bit of spicy taste though seller says no Chilli. No cockles too. Replaced with prawns.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX09lMGNBEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"The most terrible char kuey tiaw I have ever eaten. Tasteless, dry, soggy, worst than any neighbourhood hawker centre. Totally different from the first day of opening of Malaysia boleh. Please close down if you cant maintain it well, somemore charge for sgd6.80 for this. Please DON'T say it's Penang char kuey tiaw, it's an insult to Penang people."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNklfQVZ3EAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"The chendol here increaeed to $2.50 but still is much better than most others.
Like the carrot cake with bean sprouts and a bit of lard crisp, may need to wait for 10mins if they are doing fried prawn noodles...
The taste of the mee rebus is competent, there is not much ingredients. Ok for $3.50...
Tried the ipoh yong tau foo - not bad curry was thick and flavourful but a but pricy for ytf...
Teenager remarked that the ice kang at $2.50 was more worthwhile than chendol... heehee"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM3RmUFpnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"Mixed review for this one. 🤔
.
Taste wise, i think #AhPoonTraditionalBakZhang serves delicious #BakZhang (aka #RiceDumpling). The taste is great and savoury, and the ingredients are well cooked. I tried the one with #SaltedEggYolk and its yummy.
.
Unfortunately towards the end, i found a big piece of partially melted plastic in my rice dumpling. 🤢 I mean, this kind of things happens, especially when it is handmade. Hence i discreetly bring it to the aunty and inform her of the foreign object in my food.
.
To my disappointment, neither did i get a replacement/refund (not expecting it btw), nor did i receive any apology. The seller is quick to justify why this kind of things happen. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaC1yWkZnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,3,"The best place to get Malaysian food in Singapore. Although it is not super tasty but the taste is there. If you are having homesick and miss Malaysian food, this is the place where temporarily fix your craving. I tried char kuey teow and rojak. Both were not bad. Have to queue for ckt but not long. The other day I had mee siam too ($3.50). Ckt costs at $4.50 for small and Rojak is $3.50 for small. Be prepared to hunt for seats because always crowded as usual and just be patient to look around and wait for the seats. Usually people will leave once they finished their meals."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5X3Y3cVNREAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"Lots of delicious food.

Fried carrot cake is ok.
Lontong is great.
Chilli Ban Mian deproved.

Penang Char Kway Teow($4.50)😋
Kway Teow were cooked using pork lard oil to cook as I had some crunchy pork lard bits while eating. Big portion of eggs and bean sprout used. With few sauce & seasoning, the aromatic tastisfying Kway Teow with a mild spicy kick served with 2 big fresh deshell tender prawn is ready to be eaten."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncE9tQWhRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"A place packed with Malaysia hawker flair. Fried guo tiao is always the hot favorite with a long queue. I like the Penang prawn noodles, curry chicken noodles, bak kut teh, pig trotters claypot, claypot rice, duck rice, pig organs guo tiao and the nasi lemak stall’s chicken wing. There’s also an interesting dried version of ban mian that’s spicy.

The light snack or dessert, such as chendol, popiah and steamed bun is tasty too.

The place is also kept very clean with the highly efficient aunties who are clearing the tables.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyME1mWmZREAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"good food as cheap as hawker centre, tried most of the food stalls here and all are pretty good and worth the try! the longan drink at the entrance really quenches the thirst and one of my fav here would be the chaykeowtiao and hokkienmee!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjRDYllnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"Wow, incredibly rude cashier guy at wanton mee stall. Quite uncough and not sure what's got into him to display such attitude to customers. Food wise, definitely not worth the time and money. Noodle is dry and way undercooked, very tough and has powdery feel to it. The char siew is dry and tasteless. The guy cooking it wore glove in 1 hand, and he picks up ingredients using the ungloved hand, which is kinda disgusting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaHZUbnlnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,All the stalls are now open though some delicacies like the popiah was nowhere to be found during this pandemic.. this eating spot in Jurong Point have food stalls featuring the famous dishes from the popular locations in Malaysia like Penang and Ipoh.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNGEyVkZBEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,This review is only meant for the KL Hokkien Mee and Waton Noodle. Super lousy attitude and bad service from the 2 Uncle. Avoid if you can. Really will spoil your appetite....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleFpDXzB3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"Wide range of Malaysian food from popular tourist spots. Food taste okay and slightly resemble Malaysia's. For those craving for Malaysian food, can try it here. Try to avoid peak hours such as lunch or dinner hours because it's similar to foodcourt and your have to ""chop"" your own seats. 😂"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOThIS2RREAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"Tried the fry oyster from the stall behind the drink bar, there are total two stalls. Not nice , the worst i ever tried! no fragrance of oyster just like fried  starchy eggs......"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a0xIM1V3EAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"Super crowded on the weekend and difficult to find a seat but the kway chap is super worth it.

There were a lot more stalls I would love to try again, especially the chicken clay pot rice, the congee and some of the more traditional offerings.

Kway Chap and Braised Duck stall are both gone now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRbmJYNGR3EAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,Malaysia Hawker delights! Authentic Ipoh taste and Penang style delights! Love the hor fon prawn and chicken noodles.

Freshly prepared healthy ingridients with tender loving caring skillful cooking and professional authentic skills. Get the taste when cannot go to Malaysia. Friendly cosy comfy ambience for romantic intimates groups students tourists & families.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX2JuTWZBEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,There is a bakuteh stall near the chendol stall.  soo garlicky good.   The chendol is perfect dessert match
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX3RiYmhnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,A authentic taste of Malaysian Food. Gotta be best Malaysia Boleh outlet in term of taste and variety. Not easy to find seat but its all worthwhile
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX183ZF9nRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"My go-to place whenever I need a quick fix of Malaysia taste. The taste of the Char Kway Teow is consistent but they do not allow any customisation 😅

I would recommend the Nasi Lemak, Mee Hoon Kueh, Claypot Bak Kut Teh & Claypot Rice!

The Cendol is the best that I have tasted so far. Very fragrant gula melaka taste 😋"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeTdLdS1BRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"KL Wanton Mee: FAIL! Worst & Rudest Service of all stalls in Jurong Point Malaysia Boleh. Food isn’t really that fantastic, either. Nowhere compared to the original one in KL Malaysia.

Worst Service: Obnoxious stall holder (the thinner, bespectacled one) is EXTREMELY RUDE, damn bad attitude, laments LOUDLY (instead of apologising for not having enough small change) & even turns away customers & refusing to serve them whenever they pay using $50 note.

Hello who do you think you are to decide how customers should pay you??!!

Classic example of a damn proud, arrogant and UNEDUCATED Hawker. Food is also NOT THAT fantastic. A very bad name to the Malaysian hawkers I know of!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNVpfVEhnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"This is the review of the shop that sells coffee. I ordered coffee. The person who took my order repeated the order to the cashier so as to let her know how much to charge me for it. However, instead of  giving me coffee, the person who took my order gave me tea. I went back to the stall holder to inform her she gave me the wrong order. Instead of apologising for her mistake, she insisted I ordered tea. She even interrogated me like a criminal if I tasted the tea. Unbelievably rude. I will not patronise this store ever again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPc2RHcERnEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"Usually come here only to eat the Mee Rebus and Longtong. But recently I found my favourite, Clay Pot chicken rice, been ordering the $8.50 (Big) to share with my wife. More ingredients then the $5.50 (Small) ones. Worth it?

The Char Kway Teow,  not even the 2nd best off all that I've try. Told the hawker more chilli, he don't even care. Just scoop from the wok he just fried and give it to me. 👎
Will try others stalls the next time and comment, 😄 hope I remember and not go straight to my favourite."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwX2JPWnVBRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,3,"Was quite authentic on its opening. Over the years felt like the taste has been altered to suit local palate.

Not sure whether the insides of the ngor hiang (beancurd meat roll) is supposed to be wet or not. Found it slightly disconcerting but finished it because it doesn't taste spoilt or weird. Big mistake. Had tummyache for the entire night then started having diarrhear and nausea since morning. Safe to say that I won't be ordering anything from there that isn't freshly cooked to order from now on.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcU1Xc09BEAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"Now bigger and better and with a wider range of authentic food from Malaysia. Price is also very reasonable for a food court and I must say it’s about the same price as eating at a coffee shop. Very popular so expect to wait a bit to secure a table for yourself and your dining partners. The bigger the group, the longer the wait. I always go for the char kway teow and steamed chicken. On weekdays, there a 50cents coffee or tea promotion. Best paired with the huge Amy Yip bun stuffed with chicken"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlclB5Zm1BRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,1,"Ordered for Char Kway Teow no chilli for takeaway. Store assistant handed me one prepacked on the counter.

I double checked for no chilli, but store assistant now say no such thing as no chilli. I just asked him not to add in chilli when cooking, he insist cannot don't add."

Very nice taste..
Fun to sit there n eat..
Like an out of Singapore experience"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbXB2UXdBRRAB,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"Really delicious and cheap Malaysian food right here in Singapore. The KL hokkien Mee, Char Kway Teow and claypot are must-trys. If you are into rojak, give it a go as well. The ambience and decor makes you feel like you are in Malaysia. But expect long queues and you may have to stand around for a while before getting a seat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcUttYmN3EAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,5,"This is like the most awesome food court ever, full of delicious, freshly cooked Malaysian delicacies. Large and airy, finding a seat is usually not a problem after a short wait especially after the recent expansion. My favourites here include the Penang Char Kuay Teow, their steamed chicken (buy half chicken to share for better value, at $12), and the Gohtong Jaya Zi char stall. The rest of the other stalls are good too but these few are the standouts!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE4zbkJREAE,Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point,4,"The dry chilli ban mian is good. Flavourful sauce with thick, chewy noodles."

Their fingers always dip in the soup when they pass you the food. But all others stall remain quality and hygiene of foods."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTZ1lfR1JnEAE,umisushi,4,"Buta Kakuni Don($9.20)
Meat is flavourful and hard but still able to chew. Comes with rice, seaweed, ginger and half a marinated egg.

Unagi Chirashi Don($9.20)
Like the rice coral of the pearl sea blooms with the petal of silky smooth sweet Unagi tango with the pistil spicy tangy pickled radish.
A taste that bless the soul.😋

Ebiko Eel Roll($9.30)(8 pcs)😄
Traffic Light(Crabmeat, Tamago, Cucumber) sushi holding an umbrella of sliced Unagi while withstanding the heavy downpour of Mentaiko rain and hail of ebiko. What a storm of umaminess it cause to Traffic Light sushi-san.⛈️☔😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybnBUMmtRRRAB,umisushi,2,"The sushi is just above acceptable. It's not fresh since it's meant to be merely fast food. If you're looking for sushi near NTU, I recommend going to Jurong Point for Genki or Sushi-Go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa1BMdVVnEAE,umisushi,2,Below average food at expensive prices. The only good thing is shorter queue and higher chance of getting a seat. Male cashier is rude and customer service can be greatly improved. We pay to enjoy our food and not to be treated badly and be stared at.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOTh2dzZ3RRAB,umisushi,1,"On 23rd April, 2021 11.50 am, just suffered a very very rude service from the cashier. idk the name of him
He told me to got out of here and did not have meal here, just because he did not see my checkin????? Actually I had shown him several times.
Very mean and rude!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazllZUVnEAE,McDonald's,1,"Worst experience ever. I placed the order at 18:09 and now it is 18:58 and I finally get my food after times and times inquiries. It seems that my order was missing in McDonald’s system.
The funny thing is that the aunties at the counter just asked me to buy food at other stalls even though I had paid in McDonald’s. They said they were busy and no one tried to get my food ready. Then I requested to get refund and gave up the food. But they just refused and said how can I get a refund after I paid the money. (Totally wired logic)
Luckily, I am not in a hurry to do something today, and another auntie finally stood up, collected my food and beverage, and gave them to me (the food in my order is just ordinary ones, why took so long to prepare). But who wants to waste time on these tiny things, right?
Lesson: don’t order at McDonald’s in NTU if they already have a lot of orders to handle."

We spend 7.4 for the laska burgers online
However, we waited for 40 mins!!!! Could you even believe it?? We were super disappointed in McDonalds in Singapore due o the awful service. We paid by Visa card and show the receipts, yet,  compensationMcDonald doesn’t believe it and insist that we are saying nonsense. They checked the records and say that there are no records!! We almost couldn’t receive our burgers because of their lack of understanding and bad service!!!!! They even looks like that they don’t believe in us at the end even if we show them the receipt of visa card(also the message) Surely, we deserves a compensation! How could Mc Donald’s waste our time and being so demanding and mean to us! Please apologize to us. We feel awful. This McDonald doesn’t even deserves a visit guys"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydXIyaDRRRRAB,McDonald's,5,"McDonald's food with good standard, will keep up with outlets outside NTU and have the new menus. My only complaint is that it is always crowded during lunch time, but it shows it's popularity. Remember to ask for more chilli if you need."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOGFLNmh3RRAB,McDonald's,4,"Normal mcdonalds but subsidised prices as it is inside university campus. No dedicated seating as seating is open for mcdonalds, the subway, the long jhon silver's, the starbucks and the food court above"

For some strange reason we couldn’t find the Happy Meal as a selection, I’m not sure if it’s because it’s on NTU campus? The line moved relatively fast but it still took us 20-25 minutes to get our order as there were tons of people."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwM2N2UU9BEAE,McDonald's,1,The French fries here are too dry and not crispy at all. But it's the only option students have here for for late night food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3LWFfRFBBEAE,McDonald's,3,The line is simply always too long here. They have an efficient ordering and collecting system so things move. Avoid peak lunch hours. Staff is nice and keep things moving along as fast as possible. Have occasionally had bad food here though. Especially the fries which is a shame because McDonald’s fries are usually so good. And I believe prices are slightly lower because it’s an educational campus.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3BMb3hBRRAB,McDonald's,5,Clean and spacious. The kiosk machine was operating with a enough distance during this COVID sensitive time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c3BYZUpBEAE,McDonald's,4,"The fast food joint serves independant self-serving, order placing booths to customers. Food is as good like any other MacD outlets. Warm, fresh and crazily yummy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdDlTeFd3EAE,McDonald's,5,Very fast service despite large number of customers yet the quality of the food is not at all compromised. I would even say this is the best McDonald's food I've ever had quality wise. Six ordering stands are available so service flows very smoothly. Fantastic experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MElDMGhBRRAB,McDonald's,5,"In a time where burger shops are getting ahead of themselves, trying to be gourmet and all, good old McDonald’s is the best. Honest for what it is. The taste of no pretence is most delicious"

Big breakfast was unavailable on the saturday and have limited options... bad"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTb3ZMVTBBRRAB,McDonald's,4,The standard McDonald's experience within the campus of NTU. Accessible and affordable for everyone.  Only downside is the huge crowds drg peak hours drg school time.

2. Sometimes closes before the stated time

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXR1WUJREAE,KFC NTU,1,"Ridiculously slow. Management too cheap to employ the necessary staff. It's one person at the cashier, one person cooking and one person wandering around. Have to wait half an hour for ""fast food"". Buy KFC and join behind a queue of 20 people waiting for their food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeHItRjFRRRAB,KFC NTU,2,"Zingerito okok only lah. Not cheesy enough. Service still as slow as ever.

Standard KFC food. Food generally is ok but the waiting for your food to come need to take quite some time. Not sure are they lacking staff or what...
The meal I had anyway is so freaking full lol. Only thing to improve is service I guess."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbXZYVTFnRRAB,KFC NTU,1,"The standard of food here is simply unacceptable. I’ve been here multiple times in the morning, each time with the ludicrous hope that it will be better than the previous time. The porridge is so watery it feels like you’re drinking salted rice water. There were literally only 1.5 pieces of chicken in my bowl, which itself was only 2/3 full. I have never had such an atrocious experience in other KFCs before - please close this outlet down as it is a disgrace to the brand name."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlckpXZ21BRRAB,KFC NTU,1,If you like your food served AN HOUR after your ordering. This is your first choice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc01YcnFRRRAB,KFC NTU,1,"Come in 45mins  to 60 mins prior to your meal time. Order taking at counter slow, order peeping  is extremely slow as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOU1tSnpBRRAB,KFC NTU,3,"I came here during lunch time... I tell you guys, the queue is darn long... There are only 2 workers working, 1 at counter, 1 inside the kitchen.. orders are moving at snail pace... 40 minutes to get to my order... They could only pack 1 order every 4 minutes... So please order online prior to coming down to save time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeHZqbGN3EAE,KFC NTU,1,"Welcome to the WORST KFC outlet in Singapore! There is only one famous female staff that is serving and collecting payment at the same time. And you always have to wait for them to fry a new batch of chickens which takes 15 mins. The chickens are literally waiting for you to appear before they drown in the oil. There was once we waited for 45 mins for them to fry 3 batches of chickens. Mine came at the third batches. NTU KFC always doesn't have new menu like the others KFC. They do not have BBQ crunch chickens!
Also most of the GREAT promo codes that KFC offers doesn't include NTU KFC. And at night they only have chickens, no burgers. Good luck to the next batch of NTU students. Have fun camping in KFC for 1 hour!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMHI3QWdBRRAB,KFC NTU,2,"It's crowded, seasonal items are often out of stock, long waiting time and sometimes the fries or the chicken are cold and soft. I'm not a big fan of fast food, but this KFC is surely not the best out there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbXB2Z0ZnEAE,KFC NTU,4,A great fast food option on campus. However some items are not available and there is no discounted price for students.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dmN2cE53EAE,KFC NTU,1,"Ordered a BBQ pocket meal, and a zinger box with a choice of chicken for take-away.

First thing, the BBW pocket was missing, just the fries and drinks. The zinger box was fine, it had everything.

Second, the chicken i asked for was original, but the one in the box was crispy.

Third, the chicken and zinger burger was dry.

The staff were not focused at all on what they were doing. I had to remind them for the drinks that came with the meal and the box.

Anyone who wants to go should probably triple check their orders, especially for drinks and every item they ordered.

Their only saving grace was the kind uncle that gives out encouragement notes to the students."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NEtxOVZBEAE,KFC NTU,4,Hits and misses here. Wait can be long during peak hours and they have a tendency to mess up are customised orders (even simple things like change of drinks). Clearing up the kfc cafe area will allow for more seating area. All these are made up for by the fantastic uncle who gives out sticky notes wishing students all the best for their study.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOS1lTUJnEAE,KFC NTU,1,"Always no stock of something, drink, ricebucket or original chicken

Bad and slow service, no answer phone calls"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnaGZ5X0t3EAE,KFC NTU,3,"Comfortable air con seating area.

Outrageous extra charge for Diet Pepsi! Destroyers of public health"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ODhia0d3EAE,KFC NTU,2,"While the seating area is air-conditioned, the queues are usually very long during lunch and dinner. Service is often slow thanks to low number of staffs and a lack of self-ordering machines (Sometimes there is only 1 staff at the counter, who has to collect money and pick up the food/drink items all by himself/herself.) Items in this branch are often out of stock, and there is no indication of items running out. Hence it is annoying when I realise my desired item is out of stock after queuing for more than 15 minutes. (In McDonald's, out of stock items are indicated on the menu screen and blocked on the self-ordering machines.)

Update (07 Sep 2018): There are 2 self-ordering machines at the entrance now, but they only accept card payment. When I was there, nobody was using the self-ordering machines and there were more than 10 people queuing at the counter. I ordered through the self-ordering machine and surprisingly I received my food within 5 minutes, while the queue at the counter didn't seem to move at all. (There were only 2 poor staffs manning the counter and preparing the orders.)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNNGZLYldREAE,KFC NTU,3,They gave me the wrong order. Again. I guess Cheese Fries sounds alot like Bolognese Fries.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpazdqcGJ3EAE,KFC NTU,1,"DON'T GO! I ORDERED FOOD AND IT TOOK MORE THAN AN HOUR TO COME.
SUPER SUPER BAD SERVICE, IGNORANT STAFF, RUDE BEHAVIOR.

A COMPLETE NO GO! BEWARE (Yeah you heard it right! BEWARE)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0NEpfY1lBEAE,KFC NTU,1,Questionable food quality in this particular branch towards the end of day. Comes free with explosive diarrhea on occasion. You're in it to win it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODhhQlN3EAE,KFC NTU,5,Not crowded. Nice place to enjoy the yummy KFC chicken 🐔
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpazdqMk9BEAE,KFC NTU,1,"Really bad customer service taking more than an hour to serve. The NTU branch is the worst, I would suggest you to go somewhere!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ejRhSkhnEAE,KFC NTU,1,Dont have many things despite having a menu. Staff kinda rude
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c3ZuNnZ3RRAB,KFC NTU,1,Sooo slow😢 I am starving and have to wait for more than 30 mins.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cHRMZjF3RRAB,KFC NTU,4,Limited promotion but still the staff is very friendly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNazQ3eFZnEAE,KFC NTU,2,Missing order. Bad queue and order management. ☹️ Staff are nice though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNXB6V1F3EAE,KFC NTU,2,The worst KFC in the world! You wait a lot to eat bad food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNC0yUkN3EAE,KFC NTU,1,Better off eating the food court upstairs or macs. Worst quality of service imaginable
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX09TdFNBEAE,KFC NTU,5,Place is nice and there is pizza as well!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZMEtlYjRBRRAB,KFC NTU,5,Campus price point. Approx $1 -$2 cheaper than the malls.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3c0xtaXR3RRAB,KFC NTU,4,Almost always crowded but service and food is always good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dFpQMzR3RRAB,KFC NTU,5,Such a good place to eat the meal.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnaE5YN0xnEAE,KFC NTU,3,so expensive despite being in campus.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbWUtdkRBEAE,KFC NTU,1,"(Translated by Google) Probably the junkiest KFC I've ever been to. Tell the clerk to pack, pay the 0.2 yuan plastic bag and then tell me that the beverage ca n’t be put in and I want to hold it in my hand or it will turn over. So what is the significance of my packing? The ordering machine is also broken. The production speed is also very slow, and even on weekends, there are many people waiting for meals. I have never seen KFC with such a poor service

大概是我去过最垃圾的肯德基了。告诉店员打包，支付了0.2元塑料袋费用然后告诉我饮料不能装进去要自己拿在手上不然会翻，那我打包的意义在哪里呢？点餐的机器也是坏的。制作速度也很慢，哪怕是周末也有人多人等餐。真没见过服务这么差的肯德基"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbHVxWW9RRRAB,Salbiah Malay Stall,3,"Nice Malay food stall selling rice and noodles, both fried and soup form."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbThqX19RRRAB,Salbiah Malay Stall,4,Delicious but price on the high side. You have been warned...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNHJDc1VBEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,Amazing stuff. The curry had such aromatic and deep flavours to it I can't say I've had anything like it before; and the lady's fingers were some of the tastiest I've ever had - very tender and flavorful. Of the bunch I'd say the otah is the least impressionable - quite flat and bland. My wife had the lotong and she's full of priase for it as well. The food is a little more pricey than average but I think it's certainly worth it. Highly recommended! 😋👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NF9PUUhnEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,"The portions were generous and the food is nice. The chili is absolutely tasty and goes so well with the rice. Personally, I prefer the sweeter curry as gravy over the rice. Only downside for me is the cracker is not as crunchy. Will definitely come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd052czlnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,5,"Tasty nasi padang worth a try if u’re in the area. However prices have been creeping up like with many other places...

$6.90 for one meat two veg now. Additional 30cents for beef/seafood."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NzVheURnEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,I'm nor sure abt recommended  tis  as had bad experience with the staff there who making the drink total Rude !!! As for  food bought Penang Kway Teow not sure  abt the specialty as looking at it jst normal  Kway Teow tho. Plus it's very pricey.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNkthRjNnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,Tasty beef rendang.. 2 pax at $13.60. The beef is tough but is very flavourful! The Chili quail egg is not to my liking as it’s sweet. Other than that the food tasted appetising and won’t mind go back again..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbWJ5RkFnEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,Really delicious and too many great choices. Queue was long but we were lucky to get our seats. Would eat here again when Im around next time!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcU5xQmtnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,2,"First time trying nasi Padang in this shop, tempted by the crowd. It’s always full house during lunch. I ordered 2 meats 1 veggie cost me $8.80. I had a slice of fish, squid and ladies fingers with ayam merah gravy and sambal belacan. The spiciness was mild for me. Overall food is average and their sets come with drink but I didn’t order the set with drinks. They also sell some kuih-muih but didn’t manage to try their kuih."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc3RPQWJ3EAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Had the beef rendang and enjoyed it. It's a smallish place and it's always crowded, so you have to queue up. But the food is worth it and affordable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd05QbTR3RRAB,Rumah Sayang,1,"Today's 2 Nasi Lemak was terrible, barely elidable.  All the items that came with this dish have problems...

- there was almost an entire egg shell embedded in the scrambled eggs.
- the vegetable achar were basically raw with ZERO vinegar.
- the fried chicken wing was limp and basically tasteless ... and no, I do not have COVID.

You just lost a regular customer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbHBQRG13RRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,"Place feel like the 70s..or Penang Malacca style..The Serving crews Ok except for 1 lady kind of high toned voice, kind of a bit impolite."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeFl1eFRBEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,"Over priced. Charged 6.40 sgd for one curry drumstick (no potatoes, would have to add money if asked for potatoes that were in the same food tray) and quail eggs (five of them).

No rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPanRYbGZnEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Tastes good but quite expensive. This is 5.80, but 5 stars still cos yummy chilli."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXNLbDRnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,Decent home cooked style Malay meals at affordable prices.  It was fragrant and the dishes didn't taste complicated at all even though they were.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejRUeFV3EAE,Rumah Sayang,3,"Food is good with many choices, the drinks are very pricey though (a normal cup of iced milk tea for $2.70...)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaDRtNUJBEAE,Rumah Sayang,3,"I personally like the chili squid, very spicy. The fragrance of nasi lemak rice add to the tasty meal together with veg. Laksa taste normal. They got wide variety of choice for side dish to eat with plain rice or nasi lemak rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOFBEdWVBEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Delicious food....had their nasi padang of sweet and sour fish with brjnjals and ladies fingers during 1st visit. 2nd visit was curry fish head combo...not quite to my liking but was ok, their prawn fritters was yummy and a must have. Affordable and compatible prices, will return to try their ayam merah....and of course the prawn fritters!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bE1EQm1RRRAB,Rumah Sayang,2,"Got mee rebus satay, mee siam, 2 chicken wings and coffee for $17.70. Food is mediocre and pricey. The absolute downer is the workers allow people to cut queue. There was a lot of confusion about the queue and the workers allow their regulars/friends to cut queue. Even while I was eating, the queue confusion continued. For goodness sake, put up some poles, signs and lines to clear the confusion."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbTcyS05nEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,"Delicious! Rendang quality flux slightly, meat at times rather tough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcXVYTGVnEAE,Rumah Sayang,3,"Have always wanted to try this much touted stall and finally got a chance to. Gosh... Food is good but it sure is expensive! I can't believe I paid $11 for a plate of rice, beef rendang, chicken wing, and 2 vegs. One kailan and one cabbage. I honestly wasn't expecting this price tag when I was looking at the menu, as the nasi lemak cost an acceptable $6.50. My friend ordered that and added a fish, and it totaled up to $9.50 for his... $3 for sweet and sour fish slices? Totally not worth it.

But still, I thoroughly enjoyed the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OHJpZEZBEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,It have decent dishes for the rice but their meat dishes are over priced. The atmosphere is like a typical food court with old fashion decorations.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZczVuWEdBEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,"Apr 2019. I loved the food here. We ordered Kailan, spinach, sambal fish and chicken curry.
Everything was so deliciously done and tasted home-cooked.
Other than the nice food, i saw a harmonious working culture here. The younger Malay staff could speak Mandarin and were respectful to an elderly Chinese auntie.
Lots of positive energy. 👍👍👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVM0tleUJREAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Just had a plate of nice nasi padang with the red curry chicken drum stick (ayam merah), stir fried lady's finger and brinjal and a good dose of their freshly made sambal belachan. Yummy!

This eatery serves malay cuisine as well as halal certified chinese style cuisine. Very popular with our locals craving for some spicy food or chinese style halal food.

There is always a queue for the ready to order and eat items and a longer wait for speciality items like curry fish head, tau hu goreng, fried rice,  hor fun etc.

I just love their freshly made sambal belachan chilli (would be even more heavenly if they zest in the  limau purut peel). Their ayam merah is just so yummy, u gotta try to believe it! YUMMY!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbnJiTVZBEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Went for lunch, Nasi Padang is nice especially the curry gravy. Dont forget to buy Kueh Lopez is super soft and melts in your mouth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaXNqcXVBRRAB,Rumah Sayang,5,Tasty and affordable. Need to wait for a while during peak period. Staff are all friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpN3ZfQnFnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,1,"Had it on a weekday for dinner at 530pm. The long beans was very very cold and had a slight sour taste, signs of the food being prepared and left there for a long time. Blatant disregard of food safety. Ordered Ayam Merah and what arrived was similar to curry chicken, both taste and appearance wise. Was told that this is their version of Ayam Merah......is this a joke? That is totally curry chicken. The other stir fried veggie tasted horrible too but at least it was slightly warm. Two plates cost us $13++"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcE5lLVZBEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,"Was very very disappointed with the services of staff “Sira” an Indian lady. She was very rude to me and have no manners and respect .  I complained to her manager but instead of apologising to me , she defended  her staff.  I can’t tolerate such behaviour.  My lunch was served with anger and it was so toxic to eat the laksa I ordered.  I did not enjoy my meal at all.  I went back to the manager to get the No of the owner but she just pointed to me to a number and ask me to go take that down.  I could not find any number.  I want to get in the Owner Jordan to explain in detail.  Can Jordan please message me here"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaWJuaExBEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,Food is alright . Long queue during lunch hour (weekend). They have order in menu beside normal nasi padang style but it open on 12pm onwarda only.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNF95c3p3RRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,"Good and tasty food served.
Value for money and lots of freshly fried vegetables in different style.
Only one point that to higjlight.....its always long queue especially lunch tim"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndzZiVmxRRRAB,Rumah Sayang,2,"Both horfun and hokkien mee are not under their ""all time favorite"", true, both definitely are almost tasteless although with lots of gravvy. Both definitely not reco.

Small area thus seating is limited with some seats being squeezy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b0tMVkZnEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,10 august 2022 me and mother came here .tall Indian guy her reaction like laugh when my mother order tebu that means sugar cane it's that funnier.if he didn't understand.he can reply sorry I did understand.(fyi he can speak Malay  a bit ) very spoiler.hope you can teach your stuff to be more respectful ...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGNqMEFnEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,"Always the curry fish head,  the taste of the gravy is so perfect though the fish head is  abit small but veg inside is generous 👌 💯"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNE9YOE93EAE,Rumah Sayang,1,"The staff is very unhelpful , unfriendly and impatient just wanted to ask very extra gravy and said no for better dining experience dine at red ginger at imm"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNGY3RXpnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,1,First time trying and will be the last. Cashier is extremely rude. Have not come across such service for a long time in Singapore. Spoils my dinner.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcWNpOUhnEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,Good standard has dropped a lot.  Indian lady cashier was rude and discriminatory. Bring your money elsewhere.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTd2VMSzlBRRAB,Rumah Sayang,5,Limited time high tea set promotion during 3pm to 5pm is highly recommended. Laksa selling at 2.9 during this period
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHXzZMeHpBRRAB,Rumah Sayang,5,"Good food. We had fisi head curry set, very tasty"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPazUyOS13RRAB,Rumah Sayang,3,Ordered black pepper chicken and vegetable. Taste was mediocre and a lil too pricey.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpa295STdBRRAB,Rumah Sayang,3,Bought 1 piece of Kueh Kaswi and One piece of ondeh ondeh..both the size of a 50 cent coin...was charged 0.80 each.  This was my first time buying the kueh from there and will for sure be my last time.  Way tooo Expensive. I can get a better deal elsewhere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODZTWVlBEAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"The food is very delicious, and I think with no artificial flavors. The price is also not too expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZ0lPajBBRRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,"The fish head curry is good, comes with tahu goreng.
They have nasi padang too.
Crowded during lunch hours."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNG9PUXhRRRAB,Rumah Sayang,1,"We wished to bring your attention that with many years of patronage and good dinning experiences has gone to the drains.
Recently we had experienced ( many times) very rude counter staffs that were not trained in service sectors. This incidents have caused major upsets.
Hope that this bunch of jokers be replaced asap to avoid further degradation and damage to your good establishment.
Thanks

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMjl2dUhnEAE,Rumah Sayang,1,"The server lady was rude and hesitant when asked of the pricing about food ordered. During payment, the lady insisted that 3 dishes was order instead of 2. Hence, charging more for 2 takeaway meals. The food is nice but with such dishonest business conduct, we never go there again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneXRENGV3EAE,Rumah Sayang,3,Mee soto is marvellous. 🍜Thick gravy & the spiciness level is just right. Add sambal kicap for extra ‘kick’. Service is quite fast😊👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOGVfek5BEAE,Rumah Sayang,4,Nice various types of yummy malay halal food. Fast service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a3FTTlB3EAE,Rumah Sayang,4,Good food. Good price for a mall setting.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdGZTZzhRRRAB,Rumah Sayang,5,"I am a fan of the kind of food served at this place. Couldn't find another place in this vacinity with these kinds of cuisines. The sitting area is nice, hygiene is 7 out of 10 for the kind of price they charge but the taste of the food is amazing. This place has noodles as well, but I haven't tasted them. I usually do rice with a few meat options. I usually make my own plate so the price usually fluctuates and the bill always is more than I expected. If you are looking for budget eating instead of making your own plate ask for set with a fix price where you get 1 meat + 2 veg + rice or similar combinations. I will definitely recommend eating at this place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTa3R6X2Z3EAE,Rumah Sayang,5,"Restaurant selling good selection of Malay cuisine. Quite popular with shoppers and those working in or around the mall. Hence, it can be difficult to get a seat/table during meal times. Best to come early/before or after the lunch and dinner crowd. Serving portion is alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdXVtM3VnRRAB,Rumah Sayang,3,"All good but not exceptional, good for a no-frills meal. Service is ok, food is not too bad, price is affordable but not cheap. Tried the 2 pax curry fish head set which came with tahu goreng and 2 rice for $19.90. The dishes took awhile to prep but came hot. The fish was only half, slightly small. Tahu goreng was done right and portion was good. The curry was good! However, it can be too spicy and sour for many. Order extra kang kong which was cold, but taste-wise is good. Overall i would say taste and variety is good but price, portion and service have some room for improvement."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdVlfSmp3RRAB,Rumah Sayang,2,Well it used to be quite Good with the traditional (Malay) food but after today it seems like  Standard dropped.  But the rendang is not bad failed was the curry chicken gravy got no taste. Still a popular eating ground at Jem.  Can try to see (individually) the taste . That's why I gave a 3 star. Hopefully they improve.  Surrounding you have a NTUC / Banks are conveniently located.  Still at this stage are Crowded.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOWJyOWhRRRAB,Rumah Sayang,4,Food was nice . 👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb1p5d1V3EAE,Seri Muslim Food,4,"Reasonable price Muslim food eg mee siam, lotong, nasi lemak, etc. Fast moving queue as about 5 serving staff work efficiently as each staff serves each customer regardless one or five orders. Seri Muslim Food is located inside 399 Foodcourt."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMktLVGVREAE,Seri Muslim Food,5,"Tasted mee rebus from this stall, probably one of the best in Singapore, stall is clean, food is nicely prepared and presented, price is reasonable too. 👍, I can’t wait to come back again and try other food from Seri !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOGRxa2V3EAE,Seri Muslim Food,5,"One of the popular malay stalls with snaking queues on weekends which is a testament to how tasty the food is.
A stall serving malay style dishes which are nasi lemak,mee rebus,mee siam, lontong, mee soto which i believe are their best sellers. From my observation from patronizing the stall, most people will buy their nasi lemak as their sambal is delicious.
Although my favourite food and recommendation will be their mee goreng and mee rebus which will not disappoint.
Service is fast and efficient despite the snaking Q ,so be prepared to Q for a good 15-20 minutes.
Food is affordable between $3 to 4 per meal without additionals such as fishcake,chicken wing etc.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTZ05tNEN3EAE,Seri Muslim Food,4,"#SeriMuslimFood is definitely one of the better Malay food stalls in this area. A long queue is expected but thankfully waiting time is not very long as they have many people taking and preparing your order.
.
My favourite items from their menu are #MeeRebus and #Lontong. Standard menu items ranges from SGD$2.50 to SGD$3.00.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMWUtb193RRAB,Seri Muslim Food,3,Foods are tasty but not so much to choose from as we came too early at 7:30am. Lontong servings size slightly smaller than others.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHenVUeDN3RRAB,Seri Muslim Food,4,"Their mee rebus has a nostalgic taste to it, reminded me of my childhood. It is competently prepared but it falls short of being outstanding. Very reasonably priced at $2.50.
The chicken wing is well seasoned with aromatic spices at $1.50."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMk1ENlpBEAE,Seri Muslim Food,4,"Under rated Malay food stall. Long queue, fast serving. Good portion price ratio. Great tasting food with good variety. Nasi lemak must try, mee goreng when available."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMnFyNmhnRRAB,Seri Muslim Food,5,"One of the best mee rebus I’ve ever had. If not for the above average spiciness, I’d have another plate for sure. Be sure to add on the fried chicken wings for good measure!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaG9icU9REAE,Seri Muslim Food,2,Not so great even merged with boon lay nasi lemak ..food not cooked fully .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5X2NyMndBRRAB,Seri Muslim Food,5,Consistently the best nasi lemak and mee goreng in Taman Jurong! And I'm comparing this to Latiffa Huri at Jurong West!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMnFxRGxnRRAB,Seri Muslim Food,5,"One of the best mee rebus I’ve ever had. If not for the above average spiciness, I’d have another plate for sure. Be sure to add on a fried chicken wing for good measure!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNDQyZUVREAE,Seri Muslim Food,5,Good food that comes with long queue. Finally found a good dry mee siam. 👍👍👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdnUtWUJBEAE,Seri Muslim Food,5,Best nasi Lemak in Jurong. Better than the one at Boon Lay shopping center. Beware of Long queue but worth the queue.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdVpTblR3EAE,Seri Muslim Food,4,Good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwX2ZqWTN3RRAB,Seri Muslim Food,5,Nice and affordable. Good for a weekend meal.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdGFyQVhBEAE,D'Hayat Malay Cuisine,5,"Stall only operates on weekdays as this stall is in a canteen housed in the Creative Building
It has already attracted its pool of regulars despite just operating a few months...me included
Favourite dish for me is Soto Ayam...or Mee Soto if they run out out ketupat
Their chicken broth is full body flavoured...and one would easily slurp the bowl dry...
Their chicken slice servings are peeled off fresh chicken parts as seen from the white colored chicken slices..unlike most stalls which serve overbight chicken or parts that are barely edible
Top it up with their begedil...and the dish is complete...begedil is well prepared...moist and not soaking in used oil
Their nasi padang food choices are also well seasoned and prepared...certainly worth the calories on a diet cheat day
Good for eating there or takeaway if one does not like the crowd in the canteen"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxenB1ZkFnEAE,D'Hayat Malay Cuisine,5,"Every dish is flavourful and delicious. The staff is always friendly and cheerful. The prices are also very affordable.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycnNxQkxREAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",2,"Pasta portion was okay, but not worth the steep price of $8+ . When compared to competitors nearby, you can certainly get better value for your money from elsewhere. For a baked pasta, it certainly could use more cheese. Prices are not student-friendly.
Meatball was tasty, a 3/5.  But other than that flavour-wise, the pasta was a 2/5.
Overall, the pasta tastes almost like what you would expect to find from 7-11 or cheers but less flavourful and at double the price. (although the portion here is slightly more)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bTdhZUN3EAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,I ordered cheese baked meatball pasta with mushroom. Pasta was cheesy and meatballs were tasty. The pricing is slightly more expensive than other food stalls in NTU but it’s still ok overall. Taste wise 7/10.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGNINzRnRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,It should be called as heart attack pasta as pasta was very very oily and cheeze on the top makes it scarier to eat. Prices definitely are not student friendly. This pasta is a health risk and and costly for the pocket.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c0pHM3lBRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,price is a little steep for food in a school establishment but overall decent baked pasta. would be great if there were a bit more ingredients :”) coffee was good though!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NlpuSFJBEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,"Although abit on the pricey side (could do w abit more quantity), their baked pasta is one of the best ones you can find in school!! really friendly staff too :D"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOEtmOU93EAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Don't buy the 5-star reviews you see here. This restaurant is absolute trash -  as I'm sure you can see from the countless other 1/2-star posts. Food portion is not worth it for the price of the meal when you can get something of higher quality and quantity from Pasta Express nearby. Heck it, I think even the food courts are better. Although I have to say the 1-star mainly comes from the extremely rude Chinese uncle who prepares the food here. Has absolutely no patience with customers and speaks rudely."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUw3cUlnEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",2,"Pretty shocked to see the rest of reviews right before I started digging in. I got the Chicken Tikka Pasta. On first sight looks pretty good, but the taste really isn't all that. Pretty oily inside as well. Agree with the reviews that the portion and quality doesn't justify the price ($9.42 with GST) Who even charges GST in the school though actually. Don't think I'll come again unless they shape up.

Edit: Original review was a week ago. Please take note of the 5 star reviews here, very fishy. Might be fake ones. How the hell is it value for money when someone else paid 8 dollars for 6 meatballs?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOWFIUm5BRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,"Awesome customisable pasta joint :D. Super friendly staff, warm environment, food looks AMAZING 😊😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXJ2SU5nEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,"Their pasta is way much better than Pastamania.
Price may not be so student friendly.  But at this point of time, there is a overall hike in food price for Singapore.  I am glad they didnt compromise on the quality."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c3RQaXRnRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,Quite a innovative concept of Baked pasta as a takeaway food. I liked the taste and speedy service. Will definitely visit again. Cheers

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMXNtQmVBEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,"This is my second visit and I orfer the chicken meat ball pasta and the same taste amazing as always.Slightly better service by the staff will be better and will be much better if management can look into this.
Yes we understand the challenges in this industry but possible to have better staff with improved service to rock.the great concept.
All the best to zitimamas team"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUpiNVdBEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Food reminds me of airplane food. It was a unpleasant experience.

Edit: original post from 1 week ago. Shocked to see that there are 5 stars review. Those must be fake. The food is expensive and it does not taste good. Furthermore, the service is bad. When I am there for the first time, I did not notice that I have to order online and I stood there for a long time and the staff simply ignore you. The food is oily, the croissant I had was cold. Please try for yourself to find out the truth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUtYeW93RRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"As others have said, the quality of the food did not match up to the high
price (about $9). The pasta was inconsistently cooked. If you have a pasta craving within this area, I think Pasta Express or Tea Party are better choices.

EDIT: It seems that there are many 5-star reviews posted recently—make of that what you will."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTgtQjFRRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,zitimamas has great service as well as a quick fix for any cheese cravings that I happen to get through my week :-)

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaEt1WS13RRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,"Pasta tastes pretty good, great service by Samir. Highly recommend! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbU5iSHZnRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Quite overpriced for a school establishment. Quality does not justify the price.

Edit: All the 5-star reviews appearing all within a span of a few hours last week just after the few 1 star reviews seems abit sus. Suspect these be fake/employee accounts manipulating the review score - Polarising reviews of 5stars vs 1 stars abit of a give away. (I hope not, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt here). For the record I ate their chicken tikka and it wasn't great - I dont know what those people are talking about. Unless there was a significant improvement over such as short time. No hard feelings but I sincerely hope that the owners take a hard look at their business model and really consider the criticism of the lower reviews. You guys just opened, there is still time to improve things. It'll be a waste of such potential especially with a different dining concept. All the best!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLUxHTWxRRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,Decent food at affordable rates. A neat place for vegetarians too.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUxhemF3EAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",2,"Quality of food and service can be improved. Needs more manpower.

Edit: Management should improve on customer service (polite to customers and not ignoring them) and the food served instead of engaging fake accounts to boost the score. This will increase the value of the experience and attract more customers to come back again."

All is very nice except the one topped with chips. We really like these naans and mutton. But they are a bit pricey, among which there is one small bowl medium chicken meat, which is placed in a green bowl of diameter 6cm and that cost 6 dollars. We two adults and  one small child spent 28 dollars in total after the 10% off NTU staff discount."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUlhaV9nRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,4,"Food is decent, albeit on the pricier side. Students and staff get 10% off the food.

I got the masala thosai, which was extremely flavourful and tasty. Dhal and chutney provided were rich and flavourful.

The staff was friendly as well, contrary to other reviews. Will consider patronising again if in the area!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjhlYXNnRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,1,"High cost for a small portion. The dish on left is $15 butter chicken and on right is $7 Samosa Chat. Taken for a ride. Since not many options for Indian food at NTU this restaurant is extorting people.
The restaurant used to be good few years ago even though it was charging above average charge then the quality was good.
Now just pure extortion."

The service was good... and the dishes were very tasty.

The food took a little longer to arrive... perhaps this can be improved. But it was worth the wait."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eE1qN29RRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,1,"Overly priced. Small piece of tandoori chicken cost SGD 6.00 &  too salty. . Ice Lemon Tea 3 dollars. If the drink comes bigger cup is acceptable but it's small size drinks.

Raita (onion salad) finish the moment we ordered mutton briyani so the restaurant gave me one vegetable. I appreciate it but they should ask me what vegetables I prefer to have, not give any dish they have there.

Ordered food and drinks at 12.33pm. Food arrived in 15 minutes time but the drinks arrived at 1.10pm but this also after we alert them.

Ordered prawn fried rice, oily and covered with many eggs. Egg smell too obvious in the fried rice.

Overall, it's not about paying high price for the food but we need fair portion and tasty food for the price we paying."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldW9DYzFBRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,5,Such great food for someone who isnt a facility member of NTU. Dropped by for lunch and it was cheap and legit indian food.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5N1liVnZBRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,1,"Extremely poor service. It probably doesn't cost too much to smile at the customer. Maybe the food might even taste better if they start smiling. They push you to eat precooked curries lying under the heated cabinet. Ordered a  dosa, and the facial expression drops. What an effort that is going to be to fire up the pan and bake fresh dosa. I had visited this place 2 years back without eating, their reply for a dosa back then was ""Why don't you want to eat precooked curries"". It was a ludicrous question back then. Seems not much has changed in 2 years."

I feel home. Their samosas are the best. I would suggest all the samosa lovers to give it a try. I have ordered food for few events at office and home from them. I had amazing comments from my colleagues and my guests. And it was under budget. Thank you guys. Wish you all the best.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcnVQbm1BRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,4,This is April 2021. The food quality really improved so as the price range. May be due to new management. Now average price of lunch is 7$
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX01HQ29nRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,2,"Had lunch delivered over the weekend and 4 out of 5 items turned out to be below par. The plain naans were fine. The fried rice and the 3 side dishes, weren't, and this was not just a single person's opinion, but the consensus from a group of 6! Portion sizes weren't too big either and wouldn't be considered bang for your buck. (To make matters worse, I think the food might have given a few of us, including yours truly, an upset tummy).  2 stars for on-time delivery and decent naans."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZzhtLTJnRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,5,One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. I have never tasted such an authentic mutton curry and biryani in Singapore. I feel home. Their samosas are the best. I would suggest all the samosa lovers to give it a try. I have ordered food for few events at office and home from them. I had amazing comments from my colleagues and my guests. And it was under budget. Thank you guys. Wish you all the best.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcnVQbm1BRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,4,This is April 2021. The food quality really improved so as the price range. May be due to new management. Now average price of lunch is 7$
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX01HQ29nRRAB,Ananda's TAJ Restaurant,2,"Had lunch delivered over the weekend and 4 out of 5 items turned out to be below par. The plain naans were fine. The fried rice and the 3 side dishes, weren't, and this was not just a single person's opinion, but the consensus from a group of 6! Portion sizes weren't too big either and wouldn't be considered bang for your buck. (To make matters worse, I think the food might have given a few of us, including yours truly, an upset tummy).  2 stars for on-time delivery and decent naans."

⏰ they have a signage stating it will take 20-30 minutes during peak hours, and we gotten our food 10 minutes in at around 7pm on a weekend

Food was good, prata was fluffy the way I like, with a tinge of crispness at different bits - curry was generous too, spicy enough but not too overpowering or powdery.

Definitely use the $0.50 vouchers from shopee to enjoy better value off your meal! 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHelllSC13RRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,The butter chicken briyani was fabulous. Love the side dishes too. Not too spicy at all and perfect for someone who is afraid of the spice! Service was a little messy and disorganised with people cutting queues and cashier being too busy with tasks other than taking orders.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aTV2SHh3RRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,1,"Today having a very bad experience in this prata shop, one of the Chinese staff was shout at me from far. This was happened at timing 21:55.

What I was order come wrongly, but still shout at me. What kind of service attitude? Shop have CCTV recorded."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa09tR29BRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,1,"Ridiculous place. Waited 30 minutes for 2 prata to be told they have no prata. There are also alot of birds flying into this establishment. There is an alternative springleaf prata just across the street at safra.

In many of the patrons review shop was told to contact their whatsapp number. That's not necessary cos I'm not coming back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydkpqMUh3EAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,1,"Horrible takeaway experience today.
Hear me out and I will explain.

I was there to order 2 plain and 1 egg prata at around 4.15pm. There were only one other male customer dining in at that time.

The female cashier kept on asking me whether I want crispy. I found it weird that she asked but nevertheless said yes. She asked a few more times to confirm and I said ""of course I want crispy"". I even said ""if you have freshly made, why not?"" And she never replied. By the way, tell me who doesn't want crispy prata, Right? And it also insinuate freshly made right?

But upon receiving the bill, I noticed I was charged 10 cent more for each prata. I quickly took a glance at the menu board above my head and realized I was charged the prata made of wholegrain.

At that moment, I knew I was cheated. Why did she not use the word 'wholegrain' in the communication? It was an outright lie to get people to buy the wholegrain prata when she said 'crispy'.

I confirmed with her whether she meant wholegrain when she said crispy and she admitted.

Even though it was only 30 cents more in total to get the 3 wholegrain pratas compared to getting the normal ones, but that wasn't what I initially wanted.

And because I'm rushing to fetch my daughter from school, I decided not to argue anymore.

It is so disappointing that the staff lied to sell the wholegrain prata which I assume might not be popular with the general public and probably trying to improve her own sales. It was plain dishonesty.

Please guys, this is a true story.. don't fall into the 'crispy' trap."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybGRiWnZRRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,5,Excellent service. I am almost regular customer. Generally it's always crowded during late evenings and one day they missed to pack one of my items. Next day I told them with the receipt and they recalled that they forgot to pack and quickly arranged for packing the nxt day. They never compromise with quality and taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z3BYelpBEAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,1,"I ordered takeout from there. I actually went to the next shop meanwhile that order preparing and thought grab it after coming back few minutes later. When the ticket number crossed over, the Chinese woman over there yelled at me because she had repeatedly called the number but no one had come up to receive the packet.

If the given time has passed or the customer has still not picked up their food, you should keep that separately so that they can pick it up later.

Even if other customers are watching what is happening, do not shout in a public area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eFlMWktREAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,3,Good place to eat a substantial meal. They have set meals as well as individual items. Vegetarians can also find some dishes / meals for themselves. Prices are quite reasonable and portions are large. They can improve upon their cleanliness. Single wash basin in a narrow enclosure needed scrubbing.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLODhPUFBBEAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,"It was great.

Just make sure that you do not sit at the end of the restaurant as there is a basin and tray return area. At times some dinners might gargle and spit at the basin and sitting next to it might make you feel uncomfortable.

Nice songs were being played.

I enjoyed Samosa.

I want to share my experience with the dish Masala Dosa.

I did mention to the lady cashier  that I do not take onion and garlic. She said,she does not what I am saying so I requested for another staff to speak to me.

I was told by a male staff  that there are no onions and garlic in the potato vegetable which comes along with Masala Dosa so I ordered it but I did find a few peices of onions in the potatoes when I checked so I felt bad about not being provided with correct information.

Food is good otherwise.

They must not mislead the customers but provide them with right information."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdnV2WXp3RRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,1,It is so frustrating that i order pratawala through grab and came with a missing fried chicken. How am i supposed to eat?? Called the store to no avail. This will be the last

Later I comes to know samosa packed 1 each instead 2 each . Dosai received without orange chutney so I requested at counter but no one attend later again I ask one man he don’t attend .

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a2QzVDVBRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,2,"Have always had an average experience with Prata Wala whether in terms of food or service but I was very disappointed that two Fridays ago, when I wanted to eat PRATA because I was craving for it, I went to PRATA Wala and was told that ""No prata"" and that there's only biryani. Did not get anything, not even a drink. Why should I stay when what I wanted to eat was not available?"

Earlier 381 and 382 had also had collected their orders of other itemsqqa1q1.  When I confronted the manager, he argued that plain was make differently?! Isn't it with putting cheese and egg on the dough or plain dough right? What kind of logic? He could also argued that plain needs 3 min and ingredient take 5 min. So those who came in later, dine-in, paid more for their food can get to serve first then my order of 3 plain pratas and take away!? I was there the whole 33mins which based on his logic and well organised arrangement - bravo!! Conclusion, demand for your order when it is next in queue."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMHBfRGFREAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,"It would be really crowded at night and in the evening but you should be pretty fine if you are visiting in the morning or in the afternoon. However, the dining area is a bit small and cramped. A significant portion of the tables and chairs are placed near the toilet and washing area, so hygiene concerns may arise, especially at this point in time. The strategic position near the entrance of Boon Lay MRT Station while being situated in Jurong Point is very convenient. The food is generally good, though there isn’t a wide selection for vegetarians. I hope this commentary would be of use to you. Have a great day! 😀"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbnVQcy1RRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,"Standards are slowly but surely dropping. I don't mind paying a higher price for fresh, crispy prata but I hate it when they serve me pre-made ones. Made the decision to order Masala Thosai, it was good, with generous amount of potatoes sandwiched between crispy Thosai. Its weird that they served me with only Dahl curry instead of an assortment. Their teh tarik was tasteless on the day of my visit too. This my 3 stars.

Edit: contacted the hotline as requested by the business owner. Was updated that the branch ran out of the other condiments on the day of my visit. They offered me a free Thosai on my next visit which I turned down. Nevertheless, was heartened by the business owner's willingness to receive feedback. Kudos to them! Have upgraded my 3 stars to 4 stars because of this."

Never seen a restaurant that heats up already made Dosai and heat it up again with more oils and serve it to customer. We are paying high price and we are served like this.
Funny thing is the chef knows that I am seeing and he hiding and do it in a see through kitchen.

Please don't do this in foods and people's please be careful."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaS03d09nEAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,5,Good food! At the middle of the night it is one of the most perfect supper place!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bWZIZ0N3EAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,"Prata wala is a convenient food joint located in Jurong Point especially as it’s opened during late hours. They make good variety of pratas and nans with really good chickpeas and butter chicken for gravy. Set meals are a good option for all-in orders. I’ve been eating here for 6+ years. The place is usually busy even at night so waiting might be necessary. Ice Limau and masala tea is also good, with Bru filter coffee as a new edition. It makes for a good eat-in option but most good options finish post 7pm.

The staff is really working hard w.r.t. serving customers and online orders but they still manage to be available and have good service. Yesterday, We weren’t happy about not getting potato since it was almost over but they freshly made n even tried to give more than what we ordered. Such an example of service is worth mentioning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dXJucXRRRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,2,"Had to wait almost 45mins for a prata, and it tasted average. Owner needs to reconsider the manpower deployment during supper hours. Not recommended."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcy1DQ3hBRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,3,The prata made were tough to bite but the gravy was of top quality. There were few people to clear the empty dishes at the counter when we returned them. It was messy. The washing basin cubicle is too small and people with broader shoulder could not reach in to wash hands. There was a poor man inside the restaurant harassing people to offer free food or money. The counter staff were fully aware but chose not to see.

The staff is very kind and help every hungry customer to choose food with advice. The cashier is a nice guy and I saw him directing and explaining people about the menu they have.
The place is bit small compared to the crowd that Boon Lay Int expects.
The chilli prata, dosa and samosa tastes good here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRODhMc0h3EAE,Prata Wala Jurong Point,3,"Had the 7.9 butter byrani special. Four plus pieces of chicken in huge rice portion, salty crisp, pickles, and chutney.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNjdlNjFBRRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,4,"The food is amazing, but the service is bad. The lady at the cashier, short hair very rude. She saw customer standing at the counter, never bother at all. And purposely act busy arranging glasses. Even after see also never approach. Imagine people want to buy food when they are hungry, this is how you guys treat?  We are not coming there for free food, to be treated like that."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTeTc3cGl3RRAB,Prata Wala Jurong Point,3,"Had good experience with PW in the past, albeit generally on the pricier side. Not sure what happened, perhaps the pandemic has called for measures, but $7.70 for this chicken thigh and... I don't know what? Scratched my head a few times trying to recall whether this dish should comprise more or whether the delivery guy ate something from it.

Will have to give them another chance sometime."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxb3R1R2NBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,"Ordered plain prata, masala thosai, butter chicken and mee goreng. Prata is crispy and doughy, and the curry (fish and chicken) are free flow. I personally prefer the fish curry. The butter chicken is different from what I had eaten from other places, this version is more of a dry and pasty chicken curry. The chicken is super soft and tender and the spices can be a little overpowering when eating the curry on its on, but it goes really well with prata. The masala thosai was ok, I was disappointed that one of the sauce are straight out from the fridge. The mee goreng is a miss for me.

The staffs were very friendly but they forgot to make our food item twice on a quiet morning. Hopefully this is something they will improve. Will definitely come back for the prata."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOFlhQjBnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,Friendly staff and prata was good. I ordered egg and egg+onion prata. It was ready within 10 minutes. I have attached the latest menu for your reference. Last order 9.30pm.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aUtfUVh3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,"A new tenant at Safra Jurong. Prata portion is reasonable & cripsy. Unlike some other prata whereby thickness is very thin, I prefer Spingleaf prata thickness which is just nice. Dipping their prata into the thick & luscious(tomato tinch) complete the ultimate oomph to my eating pleasure.

Takeaway order during weekend morning peak hour(with grab & in store order)  is unexpected fast around 7 mins. Highly recommended for future prata visit :)

Updated review: Do show your Safra membership card upon payment for 10% discount off as Springleaf Prata Safra Jurong staff will not provide discount automatically."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOS02SmtBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,"Not a prata fan but came back 3x for onion egg prata....beautifully crisp on the outside, and well cooked on the inside. Accompanying fish curry is very good. Also tried their Curry Fish Head set which comes with a very fleshy tasty full fish head (not one-sided served by some). The set makes a very satisfactory meal. The bee hoon and nasi goreng were just ok. Service staff very patient and polite. SAFRA members get 10% off. Seating areas, indoor & outdoor, are quickly cleaned for next customer and well maintained. This new tenant is definitely a welcome change to the previous few tenants. Please keep it up, Springleaf!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHd3NUYy1nRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,Our favourite place for delicious crispy prata. The prata is made only when we order so it's always fresh and warm. This outlet has indoor and outdoor seating.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcHBqdGpnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,"New spot for springleaf prata with Safra since May 2021, this location by the pool side... nearly. located outside / beside swimming pool entrance. Fast service with plenty of space both in air con or open environment. Prata and Briyani are easy choices, nice cozy environment at almost FC price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdW9hQ09nEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,"Nice crispy prata - we ordered plain and egg prata. Definitely one of the better pratas I’ve eaten. Outlet has both indoor and outdoor seating. Didn’t ask us about our preference for curry though - we were served fish curry. Curry was ok, a tad watery for my liking. Overall, good deal via Shopee voucher."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bzlyazh3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,2,"Taste was ok only but pricing on the very high side. Ordered 2 prata with eggs, 2 normal prata and 1 chicken Mutaba (total: $27+).
Delivered only 2 pratas with and without eggs and forgotten to prepare the Mutaba.
Sorry to say and I'll not patronage again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajdmSWxnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,Good quality prata like all their outlets.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxXzhxN3ZnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,Crispy egg prata. The kopi is not strong but just nice for me who cant take too strong coffee. Price of egg prata at $2.40 is abit expensive though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybjhqUlZBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,"Bad service , inflexible . Pay full price first for my items, then later after saw someone else get discount by showing Safra card, ask for my discount they say I have already made payment and cannot be given discount. I offer to order extra prata to be served the discount for earlier bill , but flatly rejected."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbHVmNENnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,4,Been a long time customer. Need to improve the mee goreng. Standards have dropped drastically. Giving 4 stars because I hope there will improvements
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNmRPMTlBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,I only ordered teh tarik and it was very bad. Everything went wrong… it tasted like it was done with Lipton tea bag with some milk. No tarik was done. Very disappointed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnNuQVRREAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,"waited 15mins for my order. asked staff A about it and he replied ok. another 15mins passed i asked staff B and he said ok too. after another 15mins i went to ask staff C and when he checked, the order was not even taken?!?! no communication between staff"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcjZQZjNBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,"Decided to come over for dinner on the 13th November 2021.

This outlet has a house rule that doesn’t allow more than 2 person to a table, which wasn’t clearly communicated (only an a4 advisory inside the eating area itself).

It wasn’t communicated to us while we were placing our order and only after paying for our food. Me, my wife and my baby in hand were at the counter ordering our food and I felt they had every opportunity to tell us then, not only after we have paid for our food and taken out seat.

I can respect that a restaurant can have their own house rule. I am extremely upset that it wasn’t communicated clearly. We ordered something that was clearly for sharing and we have been greatly inconvenienced.

We would have gone to eat somewhere else if it was communicated to us clearly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cXNyY0ZBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,Restaurant just at the entrance of the swimming pool. Lots of variety to choose from. Especially if hungry after swimming or using the gym above.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdEpLQmx3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,3,"The food are delosh, but the service really slow! Idk maybe they shotage of staff? I ordered 1 plaster took more than 30 min, and people who are come after me get the food 1st!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMEtfRnVBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,2,"Was delighted when they open another outlet in Jurong and partnered with Grab. Prata texture and taste was still good as compared to the original store (thongsoon) however no curry was provided and not the first time; it's like eating salad without any sauce. Anyway, had diarrhoea after consuming the kambing soup. Think twice before you visit this outlet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDZpUUtnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,2,"Was craving for coin prata, but it turned out to be just mini kosong prata. Not buttery, not fluffy, not sweet... it's just smaller kosong prata, but higher price. Other than that, the rest of the normal kosong prata still acceptably crispy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnZMMUl3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,Chaos in the ordering sequence. Dine-in expect to wait 40mins when all orders went to Grab and FoodPanda
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cS16RlVREAE,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,"Yes. prata was soft like flower and the fish curry is the icing. no other curries allowed!!! or not worth it.  parking was available at 11.20am with normal car park charges.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2a1kya3VRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,1,"Ordered 3 pieces of Prata and had to wait almost 30mins. The queue is not long. Place not crowded. Workers too slow.
Avoid the place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOGZ1bXJ3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - SAFRA Jurong,5,Like the fish curry gravy. It's taste great with the roti prata.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc05UQmVREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Really good Indian restaurant, we frequently go there when we visit the science center.
Staff is friend and food really tasty.
The only 2 areas I would suggest to improve would be:
- to add some sound absorbing panel, restaurant is really noisy during peak hours
- improve kids menus with vegetables, as it only propose fried food as main dishes"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejVEbFdREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"A strange place for a good eatery to be for sure! 🤔 Nestled in Science Centre, next to Kids Stop. 😂 The naan was legit possibly the best I’ve tried! Soft, fluffy, crispy on the edges. 🥰 Tried fish tikka, chicken tikka, butter chicken and palak paneer and all were fantastic as well! Prices came up to $88 for our table of 5+2 which was very reasonable!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcGJTS1NREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Now newly located to science centre and still out most favorite restaurant in neighborhood. The fish briyani is excellent and different from other restaurants. They have fish manchurian cubes instead of tawa fried vanjiram in briyani. They dont use food coloring which i personally like a lot. We visited on a friday night for dinner and there was queue to be seated. Service was good and fast. The place is bigger than their earlier location (opp. to phoenix LRT). Mutton gosht curry was tasty. Pappad with mint chutney will be served for free.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb283QVp3EAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Great indian food. Jeera rice is so fragrant, it’s hard to eat just plain rice any more. All the dishes we ordered were fantastic.

The biggest problem was actually the beverage… the ice tea was sad. 🥲"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dG9YUlJBEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Great food! Price is affordable too. Highly recommend the tandoori chicken - really tender and flavourful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNVBiUzJBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"Had first visited Phoenix at the original location on a few occasions in Bukit Panjang near Phoenix LRT (hence the name?). The homely atmosphere coupled with the personal service from the owners made it a regular 'go to' restaurant. And of course the food, which is why we keep coming back.

Was happy that they moved to a location inside Science Centre, easier accessibility and quicker drive from home! They've got a bigger space now in a more cordial setting, as opposed to the 'industrial feel' location they were in earlier.

The food doesn't disappoint and spice levels were just about nice on the curries we ordered. Not too overpowering and extremely pleasant on the taste buds. Doesn't give you that heavy masala-ish feeling that makes you feel bloated and heavy. So it was very light on the spices which can pull you through a post-lunch meeting without nodding off!

Service was a tad disappointing, probably new staff that needed a bit of training? The lady owner was around and of course very friendly and hospitable as before. But service in general needed some improvement.

The new ambience is nice and a welcome change from the smaller space they had earlier. They also have an extended dining space to cater for a larger crowd, especially on weekends.

Must try item - Bhuna Gosht!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3VySzJBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"Just the typical Indian restaurant, hot 🥵 and spicy 🌶
There are two restaurants here, Italian and Indian in Singapore Science Centre.
If you are not used to or fond of eating spicy food or queuing up for food…better come to science centre with full stomach 😊 to enjoy the exhibits."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNnFyUWJBEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Really nice family run restaurant, friendly place.

Quiet and unusual spot, located inside Omni theater, to the left of the entrance.

Food was rich and savory, delightfully crispy (yet soft) naan. Aloo Gobi was the dry version. Butter Chicken was amazing.

Must patronise!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MU5QNTRRRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Ate at this restaurant for the first time today and we were impressed by its taste and service! Loved the garlic naan which was a little crispy on the outside and sag mutton which was so tender. Lady boss was also nice to help us inform the kitchen to remove the spice in the mutton dish and came over to check that it was done so when we were eating. Will definitely be back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndzZ1VFF3EAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Service has improved. Cleanliness too. Now at Kids stop near Science Center. Prices have increased a bit. But still not bad at all.

The food is very good. A great authentic  ""India"" Indian restaurant in Singapore. Generally this is how food is in India compared to what we get in Prata places and local restaurants in Singapore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNU5hWjhBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Phoenix Indian Restaurant relocated from Choa Chu Kang to Jurong East - Omni Theatre / Kids Zone to be specific. Sparkling clean new restaurant, friendly service and superb food! My friends and I have become regulars of this restaurant and we highly recommend trying ALL flavours of their Naan! Other than Naan, Butter Chicken is a MUST order!  Love their Tandoori Chicken and Gobi 65 (Fried Cauliflower) too! Not a fan of their Lollipop Chicken, though it's a good dish by itself but we felt that it just didn't go well with the rest of the traditional dishes we were having. Their Masala tea is very good too! Will continue to support this restaurant!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc2RqNmxBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Queued about 30mins to get in, thankfully we got seats! Highly recommended to queue a lot more 2hours earlier before closing if you don’t want to stand in a long queue and ended up ordering take out cause last order is at 9.30pm. We ordered garlic naan, Gobi 65, chicken tandoori, buttermilk chicken and other dishes. They all were delicious and freshly made, the naan was so soft and fluffy, chicken tandoori isn’t tough or dry. Everything and services was great! Definitely worth the wait!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5d0xYS3hnRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"It was located near Phoenix LRT, moved two months ago to Science center (rose from the ashes).

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTlHRkFREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"Its our first time at yr resturant. Thk u for the friendly service. The curries are not too spicy n came piping hot which we love. Thumbup for free flow papadam. It will be perfect if the condition could keep us cool during mealtime. We are perspiring😅.

We will definitely be back for more catchup meals wuth friends n family.

Keep up your good food n thk u so much🥳🥳🥳"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnd3FLY1VnEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Authentic Indian food. Very attentive owner who recommended us a dish. But was a little insistent on us not taking a spicy one. I don't know if it is good or bad 🤣.
Their food is Amazing, flavours of spice is abundance. Cheese nan might be better to use shredded cheese instead of slice cheese. Makes not so evenly spreaded.

Overall: still an amazing place for Indian food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeFlhX3B3RRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"North Indian Cuisine at its finest

This is truly a hidden gem and we were surprised to find it on our way to The Science Centre. We decided to have both Lunch and dinner at Phoenix as the Food & Service is really remarkable!

For lunch the Vegetarian Biryani and Chicken Biryanis were superb!
For dinner we had 4 types of Naan Bread, Chana Masala, Palak Paneer and Fish Masala. The food is amazing!

I am really fascinated by their speed in service and above all the food is simply affordable. Do look out for Mr. Jovan Tan, the fine gentleman who took good care of us when we dined at Phoenix.

Our empty plates, speak for itself. Special compliments to the Chef's!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbWJma1F3EAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"This place has been a favourite always. We went for dinner and grabbed something light (Chapathi and Ghobi chilli) with a nice hot cup of chai!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNGVTSlRREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Food items are very reasonably priced, garlic naan was crazily good. Butter chicken, mixed vegetables and the complimentary papadum were all done perfectly.

Will have preferred butter chicken to be in bigger chunks to add to the bite though 😊 Kulfi was too sweet for my liking, Nuts added were generous! I will definitely be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOG9fa05BEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,Marvelous north Indian food. Highly recommended!

Its a family run outlet. Very well managed. Good food and even better service.
No wonder they only open for dinner and remain occupied.
We usually reach by 7.30 pm because by 8 they start to have a queue.
The last orders are at 9.30."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdy1xRDNRRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,Many dishes were quite well-executed and prices are ok. The wait is a little long though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbDQzWnRnRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,4,"The indian restaurant is hidden in the shop houses on the Phoenix hill opposite the Phoenix station. Carpark is available at a fee right in front of the restaurant. However, parking along the landed houses is also quite easy.

The place is neat and clean, and the staff is rather friendly and attending. We were recommended dishes based on our preference, and the food tastes really great as well. Naan is slightly over done with quite some burns, but overall quality of the meal is good. They also serve wine here if you are seeking some romance over dinner. It is well decorated for nice ambience.

Tandoori dishes are perfect, and would definitely try again in next visits. They also do delivery and work with deliverloo."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZZ2JEcC1RRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"North Indian food is quite expesnive here in Singapore but this restaurant serves you good food at fairly reasonable prices. It lives up to my expextations. The butter naan is the softest and probably the best that you can find in Songapore. Reastaurant staff is really nice, they serves you a range of mouth watering vegetables and kulfis."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDlLbmVBEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Gem in the west. Tucked inside kidstop and near science centre.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbFBXV2NREAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Was at science centre observatory last week and couldnt forget the bryani smell that filled up the science centre compound. So i decided to pop by today. It is secluded, as u enter from the kids stop entrance even when the kids stop is closed.  Food is served hot. Ordered prawn masala, butter chicken, naan, bryani rice, tandoori yoghurt chicken. The food is refined and of good standard. One of the best Indian food with very reasonable price. The yoghurt tandoori chicken is exceptional, juicy and the full of the grill fragrance. The butter chicken is more of the tomato type and my children love it. They downed much rice with the butter chicken sauce. Very good service, as they refilled the papadum. It is definitely my to-go indian restaurant now."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycWVUV3d3RRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Perfect services and very kind indian aunty who served me. Good food and naan, especially the ""papad"" for all customers and i asked her bout it. When i take away my leftovers she even packed me some extra papad omgg.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd09lUzNnRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Me and my friends ordered the bucket naan (which comes in 4 flavours), the butter chicken, the fried cauliflower as well as the curry fish head. The food that we ordered were solid and delicious. Even the fish is fresh and really goes well with the curry and the other vegetables. The curry sauce was really rich but yet not so gelat. Would highly recommend anybody who love indian food to come to this restaurant cause it's really worth the money :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazVYMzl3RRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Good value for money with good portion of food. Taste great. Looks like a family run restaurant with friendly staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaFlXZE9REAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Amazing North Indian cuisine at an affordable price, staff are very friendly towards customers. 5/5 would recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcl9XQXpRRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,"Authentic Indian food. I get stomach burn after eating curries from some restaurants. Tried a few dishes from here, no issue at all. Requested for extra spicy, they prepared it according to instructions every time. Indian food in Singapore is way too expensive. This place is a rare as the food is good and it is reasonably priced. I will definitely order again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdzV5Y05BEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,1,"good food, but when order thru online food apps, rejects the order after confirmation at the door step for self collection.
Poor customer service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbGRUTUJnEAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Visited the Phoenix Indian Restaurant during Kids Stop visit. Tried only Vegetarian food. All items were tasty and delicious. Were served well on time.  The restaurant service is very good. Staff are extremely courteous. Haven't seen a better North Indian Restaurant (tasty and economical at the same time) in this part of the city. Would surely visit again. Highly recommended for good North Indian food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MHJxajZ3RRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,1,"Really good food - have eaten multiple times and always appreciate the taste and quality.

Its understandable that the place gets quit crowded and the waiting time could get higher , however , being rude is definitely not appreciated. One of the ladies at the counter was quite arrogant towards us as we waited to get a take out for easily 60 mins over a 30 min wait time. At around 50 mins mark, whilst we enquired about the status - she was kind enough to rudely tell us - ""want or not want - can cancel if not"". Hey - we get it the food is great and stuff - however this is not the way to treat customers - at the end of the day - we are just asking and checking on the time after waiting at the restaurant for nearly an hour and probably we will wait more too - however , talking politely goes a long way in retaining customers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ1pqZ3dBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Overall quality of food is good though the fried stuff can be a bit too oily. Friendly service staff. Relaxed environment and an overall satisfying dining experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydHNPRHNBRRAB,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,Consistently good food. Value for money. Pleasant service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeWVpdUZ3EAE,Phoenix Indian Restaurant,5,The food was great! Must try the Naan bread.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUp1cG53RRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,Gem at west area. Only disappointing dish is that the spinach is watery and diluted. Service is not very good because they make u wait. Ordered masala tea and recheck with one of the staff but seem to ignore us. However the masala tea is very good!! Mutton murtabak has alot filling too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHVDWUdnEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Very affordable indian food in a restaurant style setting. Depending on your indian food craving, do take note that they have different menu options for breakfast, before 5pm and after 5pm.

I went during lunch and really like their sets which comes with quite a few sides. The gobi manchurian is much tastier than the chickan manchurian (price point is the same fyi!). Their naan is on the thinner side so order more if you are going for that. Stuffed paratha came really piping hot and the teh tarik was good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX3RTcnF3RRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,"Simple place, food tasted better than expected. Staff who took my order was perplexed by my order, another staff suggested naan to go with the gravy I ordered. I'm on a low carb diet so no rice/bread. Appreciated the staff service and friendly boss. Craving for Indian food settled!"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGJOdRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,Mutton Briyani with a side of butter chicken. Indian food craving satisfied 😁😁. The meat was soft and tender. Curries were just right for me and not too spicy.  Prices are average and comparable with other Indian restaurants.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydnQzMmFBEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,1,"I love Indian food and used to be a big fan of Anjana, I recommend to some of my friends and the love it too, the service and food was great on my last visit back in 2021.

I pay my visit again in 2022, and feel like I'm in a totally different restaurant. Service was bad, especially one of the young staff that no wearing the uniform.

I ordered butter chicken naan set, and see this is what I get, the portion much smaller than what I had previously, and they served white rice instead of nasi biryani because they run out of biryani. You can inform your customer up front so that we can choose another option, but no, they service you with white rice and when you question them, they answer impatiently.

Won't come back again with this kind of service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2X2VIWjlnRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,"Food is authentic Indian food. Had dum biryani, butter paneer, egg dosai and tissue prata. Price is reasonable.  Prefer this 10x over places like Springleaf prata place.

Update:
Inflation is bad. The serving size is quite small. Lucky to have 5 small cubes of meat in their mutton."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cDVleHpRRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,2,"Had to edit this review as I was charged $3 just for a small bowl of plain rice. When I questioned, the cashier pretended that the rice came with some vegetables. This could have written off as just a misunderstanding but I was dining right in front of the cashier, two meters away! Dishonesty is not a good way to attract customers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNTQtcFdBEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Food was amazing. Of all the Indian Foods that I have tasted so far, this one stand out to me as ""best in class"". Sheer quality of the food is impeccable and beyond comparison. I strongly recommend and will continue to recommend to my family and friends. If you have not tasted yet, try it and you won't regret. Thanks and its simply the best."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MDdfV1F3EAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,Its not bad.. the curries are deep in flavour and tandoori chicken is tender though meat is a little dry. Naan is soft and absorbs all the curry dip nicely
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc056Y01REAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Food is absolutely delicious, 10/10. 👍

Do try their Briyani sets or Vegetarian Thali set, with Masala Spiced Tea 😋"

But comparing with other restaurants ok
But serving staff is irresponsible"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycmIyS013EAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"The menu has a lot of variety. The waiter was patient to recommend less spicy options for me and spicy ones for my family member.

We ordered butter chicken naan set and mutton naan set. Both were delicious! The Masala tea was very good!!  Prices were reasonable too.

The owner was friendly and we look forward to our meals at her restaurant again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDlPS2NnEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,Good quality food. Reasonable price. Both veg and non-veg options. Indian snacks available. Nice ambience to sit out. They don't chase you even if you spend quite a long time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMlotdlN3EAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,"Been to Anjana a few times over the past couple of years but taking the opportunity to write a review after my most recent visit.

As mentioned in other reviews, I have to admit that the food quality has taken a slight dip from the time they were in the smaller space, to the time they've expanded. Seating, space and ambience is decent with outdoor seating being a plus. Service is quite alright, definitely nothing to complain about.

This time we had chicken dum biriyani and I had to admit that it was a disappointment. The naan set with mutton roganjosh was much better. One suggestion would be to possibly cut down 1 side dish in the set. But pretty much all the items in the set were tasty, and that goes for the naan too. Chicken murtabak was quite huge, a bit oily, but overall quite nice. Mango lassi a tad too thick that it was an effort to drink it using the straw :)

An 'alright' experience at Anjana, though the food is no doubt good, I believe it lacks consistency - unlike the last time. So an improvement in that department would do wonders."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaW9HNC1BRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,Was doubting the name of “best Indian food” and came here to try. But it surprised me with its flavors. Ordered a set of North Indian Thalli and one special Thalli. It came with 5+ different curries with bread and rice. From savory to sweet curry are all really amazing. Def worth a try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOUo3UmhRRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,3,"Food is tasty and the ambience is good too , but need to improve in service side

During one of my visit I experienced these

The waiter didn't took my Order Properly, and the other staffs are also not so professional in taking orders and serving them

One of our dish got delayed so much and at last we cancelled that order and left

Need to improve in their Service side

Food is worthy , some mouth watering dishes are available , Got many Vegetarian options.

May be this day isn't the best day for me and the Restaurant"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLc2VxQlJnEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Awesome food, my personal favourite was the butter chicken masala. Sometimes it gets crowded at morning and evenings because of it's popularity."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNTlERExBEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Our second time here, this time round we only had some snacks and drink.

Overall food both times are yummy and prices are ok too. Though I would love the Ginger Tea (Teh Haliah) to have more kick 🤪 it is a bit on the lower taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbkx6am1RRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,"Good food and nice ambience. Sipping a hot cup of masala tea watching the rain splatter away while a cool breeze sweeps over was blissful. It does help being located in a uncrowded and quite place, and it elevates experience.
The butter chicken and naan was great too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTcVBXSWdnRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"This is one of the must try in vision exchange serving authentic Indian food. Tried the butter chicken naan which is alot for a normal lunch. For light eaters, I will recommend it for sharing. Complete the meal with Masala Tea or Teh Tarik. The cost of a set like this is about $12."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbzc3RUdnEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"O.m.g. very good.

The Gobi Manchurian was rich and flavorful.
The Fish Tikka was tender and juicy.
The butter chicken set was nice and well-balanced too.
Masala tea could be better though.

Sorry didn't take any photos.. We cleared everything on the unassuming plates before I thought of that. Lol"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcFBfcW93RRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Me & my friends visit this place at least one to two times a week. The restaurant serve very delicious north Indian food with freshly prepared chapati.  The meal contains various vegetables & non-vegetarian variety.

For spacial occasions, I love the naan & various bread varieties with butter chicken.

Deserts are also available for people who like to end their meal with sweets."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdzlTQXBRRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"With so many Indian restaurants around the place, Anjana’s stands out with their service and taste. They take order from each one of us and treat us like family which is a rare quality now. And, both south Indian and North Indian dishes taste delicious thanks to the authentic chefs. One Mr.Ranjan does amazing North Indian food. Just ask him what he wants and he whips his magic around and creates world class food.

P.S. Their complete vegetarian meal is packed with so many items and is priced at only $6.5"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta3ZMcW1BRRAB,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,5,"Tried their children drum briyani and butter chicken naan set. Spices were plentiful and dishes were flavorful. No service charge and GST. Teh C ice was only $1.50, same price as coffeeshop. Coffeeshop prices found in a restaurant. Definitely value for money and I'll come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWM3ZGJnEAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,4,Value for money. Excellent location and very spacious.  Both north and south indian food and drinks available. Friendly staff. Prices are very good. Portions are good for rice meals. Quality of meat in Mutton Biryani was good. Overall it is a pleasant experience considering that it is not a fine dining place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ3JmbEJREAE,Anjana Kitchen - Best Indian Restaurant Singapore,1,"It breaks my heart to give this review. This was my favourite Indian restaurant in the west! We were so thrilled at how complete the flavours were and how authentic it was a year back. There was no question- every time we felt like having South Indian meals, it was always Anjana’s. Now they are very inconsistent. Disappointed thrice already (I know; I keep going back searching for the old flavours which brought back childhood memories). Most recent bad experience was for Tamil puthandu (new year) with curries that were still raw, veges haphazardly cooked without any flavour . I don’t think they are coping with the increasing volume of orders. They need to increase capacity, staff and not compromise on taste -this is their strength after all! We want the old Anjana back :(
From,
A die-hard fan of old Anjana"

The masala tea is a must-try, best one I've tried in SG :) I've not tasted anything disappointing there so far. Love the naan, love the rice, love all their gravies and their chapatti. They expanded since I last visited and feature a cosy ambience with solid wooden tables and cushion chairs too. Mmmmm! 😍"

We didn’t feel good service here..

Good location, good food was completely ruined by bad customer service and cutleries used. It's really bad for the person who is taking our food order to move to other table abruptly while we are informing him our order. Cutleries quality of washing and the wash basin condition immediately has to be resolved to keep up the customers"

My mum had been there previously and the food was good. But had a horrible experience today. There were small cockroaches running around the place. Spotted at least 3 of them. To make matters worse, one of their staff (Imran) was extremely rude. His exact words were “cockroaches are everywhere” implying that it’s normal to have cockroaches in a F&B establishment and continued to argue that the place is clean. He did not take any accountability whatsoever and had the cheek to argue that it’s not a big deal to have cockroaches running around in a restaurant. The manager then spoke to me to address the issue. He was very nice and polite but it doesn’t make a difference that the restaurant is infested with small cockroaches. I will not be returning to this place ever again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc015N1dBEAE,Boss Bar & Kitchen,2,"Wanted to order from Devil's Kitchen but it was not yet open for business. So i walked a few more steps down and decided to order from this restaurant for a family dinner. It was nice as there was a 1 for 1 pizza / pasta offer.

Probably the first and last time I will order from this restuarant. Pizza base looked pre-made, ingredients are in generous quantity but the pizza looked like something you can simply whip up at home. Pasta was probably the only dish I might give a slight thumbs up for.

The ribeye was overdone. Salmon steak was also a miss (these mains comes with somd salad only, in case you were hoping there were fries as well)

Customer service though was a plus as there is this guy who would give out papadum to customers waiting for their orders.

I waited close to an hour for my order too. There was no proactive updates from the waiting staff as to the progress for my order (i waited in F&B before and this was something I did to my customers who had to experience long waiting times, and no one had to train me to do that, IMO its just common sense)"

Today I ordered mutton biryani - it came with a large piece of mutton but extremely tough. Couldn't chew it. So had to throw away mutton.

Basically I just got then 1 egg and biryani rice for the price of mutton biryani."

So I complained, on google.

Then the chef Velu contacted me and offered refund and requested to withdraw the review. I said ok.

Adter 2/3 days I went there again, he told me he can not serve me as his management has decided not to provide services as I complained 3/4 times.

So they are not interested in correcting the problem , but just want to bar people who complaint.

Done ever go here. All rotten food. I am now proceeding to complain to Food authority. Once the do inspection it will be clear.

If you need Indian food, there are other options on same building and fortunately they don't serve rotten food."

searched Google Map for a place near Jurong Point for lunch, and found this new restaurant.

it’s actually inside TungLok Seafood restaurant and sharing the large eating hall.  can actually order from both restaurants.

the food was great, way better than i was expecting!😋👍

i like the most were:
a. thick and fresh Sake Sashimi.
b. crunchy outside and soft inside Truffle Tempura Prawn."

The wagyu may not be the best as they don't entertain the doneness of the meat (meat is well done) and the foie gras is probably from duck (and not goose) , it is huge, but the price is certainly right! The sashimi is definitely top grade and really fresh! The kurobuta pork is delicious and there is 1 abalone in it !

5/12/2021 - returned for their Omakase Teishoku. Teishoku means the meal is served all at one go. It was good and included sake which we could take home instead of drinking there, but they gave us only 1 bottle although there were 3 of us."

Served with chawanmushi, miso soup, refreshing salad of the day & dessert of the day.

Legendary Wagyu Don Set($36++)
Not legendary at all. The aburi wagyu tataki beef taste was great with chef's special teriyaki sauce but texture was well-done. What an instant disappointment. Foie Gras was sinful and fatty. Served with koshihikari rice, deep-fried garlic chips, sous vide egg, nori, pickles and radish.
Set comes with salmon sashimi, miso soup, salad of the day & dessert of the day.

<bora chirashi don> we are usually quite selective when comes to sashimi as we are concerned about the freshness. To our surprise not only the look is appealing, the cut was pretty fresh too! Yumz

<Unagi don> pleasant to find that it comes with an onsen egg and jelly fish salad too. Love the egg as it add on to the moisture of the rice. The only thing that, the unagi is on the slightly saltier side, it would have been perfect if it’s lighter in the marination.

Both dons come with a seaweed soup too! Can you believe it that above order only cost $16? Yes.. it’s super worth it!!!"

The machines to order are a little bit counter-intuitive, being connected exclusively with their related local stands."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHemI2eXpnRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),1,"Ordered Udon and Skewers. The hottest thing were the Miso Soup and Chawamushi, the others are all lukewarm. Lukewarm Udon!

If you have to eat here, avoid these two."

I wasn't even intending to eat there but the smell was just so enticing. I was walking past and there this mouth-watering aroma. And I went to check it out, the variety there not bad, so I ordered the beef don. Although it was on the pricey side, they do deliver the goods. Beef was cooked just nice, not overcooked and chewy like many other restaurants, the texture was great. The sauce was amazing, when it arrived, there was a wonderful ""grilled-smokiness"" smell, wonderful. Rice was cooked right, not mushy, good job.  Would be happy to return again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPelliMnhnRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),5,Love having their sushis with my family. Great prices and great quality of sushis.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjU3XzFnRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),5,The waiter enthusiasm，the is good
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNk81NxAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),1,"Did not enjoy it - upsized portion was still relatively small, taste was just mainly salt and soya sauce from their udon sauce. Comparing it to the ichiban dry udon that I had, ichiban is wayyyy better. Udon was not Q, just flat. Probably some cheap variant.

Also be prepared to wait 20 mins in an afternoon with nobody because the “chefs” (management trainee) have no idea how to make the food. I saw them flipping through a printed piece of paper which showed the steps on how to make the food. Imagine that. Subsequently lots of staff were called to the kitchen to help after customers piled up. Imagine a group of newbies making your food. That’s how it’ll end up tasting.

Tried the fried Rice before. While it looks nice, it’s tasteless and flat. Very little meat also. Definitely not worth the price paid.

Manager Kim saw the crowd piling up and customers looking increasingly frustrated, chose to turn her head and walk away. Deliberately avoided eye contact with people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMmZENTFRRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),4,Food was great. Price slightly lower than restaurant. Worth a try I would say.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NHN2TU1nEAE,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),3,"Mid quality Japanese rice that’s not really chewy, and clumps together. Skewers are a rendition of Tori-Q, but &Joy does it slightly better. Tempura is made of breaded flour and not actual tempura batter. Soggy and inner filling is so so. Tamago egg is a little too salty. Fried rice is just soya sauce with rice. Almost tasteless.

Ambience and service is good though however."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdk51X3dRRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),3,Doesn't really like there. Is quite disturbing. Even the staff would brings up politics views of the company to you. When you already had enough from your work place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDejdlRDdnRRAB,&JOY Japanese Food Street (Jurong Point),5,"Food is really fresh and they current have a 1st anniversary deal which is attractive!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM0lhallREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Menu offer is simple, neat and clear. Sushi rice is done just nice and taste moist. Although it’s at slightly pricier side, but the ingredients offer on sushi is fresh. But some types are quite saucy but probably it’s cater for general crowd. Can come back and try their noodle, rice and appetizers. This train concept is good as increase in efficiency in delivering the ready dish on table. So that customer can finish save time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNzZMOWhRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,It's nice to have another Sushi Train option. Every one has their own specialties and reason to patronize. For Sushi Go I like the varieties of Sashimi they offer. There are slightly more premium items as compare to others. Hopefully there will be more branches soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybjZfaEFREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"My favorite sushi goes to a place. They have a variety of choices, and the sushi is made fresh based on orders. The only problem is they only served one small plate of sauce (wasabi and soy sauce per person) when you are seated. You need to request more soy sauce when you finish it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM0pYSnRRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Taste is not bad, normal price. I personally like this kind of train conveyor belt 😬. We came for weekend dinner, a lot of empty tables. Just that we needed to queue for a while because they took quite some time to assign tables.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdDgzZFdREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Overall not bad. Just that portions are small.
Must get the giant prawns.
One thing they can add is the option for special requests cos I realise a lot of their dishes are with mayonnaise."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0syOHFnRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"Fast, clean. Slightly advantage in the varieties,  so can order what your personal  that you like.

Fast sushi but good place to have decent peaceful catch-up meals without rushing in a busy shopping centre environment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycXZpSzNRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,Chance upon Sushi Go while exploring B1 of  Jurong Point. The main question to answer is Genki Sushi vs. Sushi-Go. It was almost a year since i been to Genki but i felt the variety of sushi was more in Sushi Go. The online menu through scanning the QR is user friendly but it would be nice to see what order has been served through the app. Every $20 for a token to ice cream claw machine although it is not 100%. However one small issue is that they serve powder for the hot green tea instead of tea bags so after the first cup most of the tea is gone.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXczk2V2V3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Worth the try! I’m not picky about food so it’s decent for me! Tho my bf who ate the sashimi said it’s not super fresh but still okay:) Love the fried salmon skin & egg mentaiko!! Rice bowl with the fried chicken was nice too~ But can get gelak over time, portion was good (for me cos i’m a small eater) Big fried ebi prawn also one of my fav 🤤

Food came fairly fast, staff was friendly & polite! Though had to wait alil at the entrance, im guessing cos they had 2 staff working (1 clearing table 1 at cashier) while others are on break or smth? So be more understanding towards them! Will come back :)

Also for every $20 spent u can get coins to play a catcher / kiap kiap for an ice cream outside their store!! and my bf did managed to catch one hahaha"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbDhXeEJnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,Sushi wasn’t special or exceptionally good but it’s a nice place for ‘train served’ sushi. Price was reasonable but not as economic as other express sushi place. Would recommend to try if you want to have sushi while you’re in the area but definitely won’t travel to eat there deliberately.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXczh5SG5nRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Have Been Wanted To Try For Awhile, Finally... Visited 😊 I Think It's Much Better Than Sushi Express & Similar To Genki Sushi 😋👍 Will Be Back~"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNEkyZ1hBEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"Loved their food so much and most of the food are much better than genki. Their sashimi is super fresh and reasonably priced. Waiting time is not too long too. Must must order their waffle ice cream because ITS AMAZING. I loved the chocolate one as it has choco bits inside. I think its some kind of japanese brand ice cream you can get elsewhere but anyway just eat it!!

You will also get token to their claw machine for every certain amount spent which i cant rmb off hand. But you can try your luck for a cup ice cream there. Hopefully they have more outlets (esp the east) and i'll be sure to visit 😋"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLWRqNFp3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Decent sushi at an affordable price.
If you looking for quality, this is not probably the best place.

Like quite a few and also felt sad on some too. Ikura gunkan is yummy and love the spam. Truffle Chawan and Hotate sushi is okay. Get their salmon, will not go wrong. Sashimi still ok. Oyster look good but doesn't taste nice.

Get their normal Chawan more worth it and delicious.

Every $20 spend can play claw machine catch ice cream."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaDZfMmZREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Genki sushi has always been my family's to go sushi place as my kids loved the sight of the train delivering the sushi. After visiting this place, I'm beginning to think that this may be our new hangout.

I really like the variety and uniqueness of the sushi they serve here. The especially like the thick cut salmon sashimi that is so satisfying to chew on. Food arrives promptly after ordering. Do come earlier as the queue forms rather quickly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenRfZG1BRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"First time trying. Food is really yummy, friendly staff. Menu is large.

Looking forward to my next visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMS1MNTdBRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,"Affordable sushi price. I have tried their salmon mentai don, not so suit my taste but there was good taste for normal sushi. Normally have long queue during lunch and dinner time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjRMYllnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,This place makes Sushi Express feel like an artisan sushi restaurant. Food is slow to serve and sushi looks pathetic. Sashimi dont look fresh and is unappealing. Better off with other options. Worse sushi place I been to in my life.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eWVqNGt3RRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,Order via app! Food was served in a timely order. Overall experience with minimal contact with staff except payment. Should improve the app to complete the whole dining experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bXZUMjFRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,"My child wanted to try out, food is very average, not enough staff on Sunday.

Long wait to go inside even no one in front of us, ordered a green tea also need to keep asking the staff ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd3RXUElBEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Always had queue when we passed by, finally got to try Sushi Go on a Monday noon...
Free wifi so everyone can order from the online menu. Our total bill was $56plus for 3 of us. Food is fresh and served quickly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bTlQamRREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,Was unfortunate as one of the items sold out jist before I check out on Sunday night. The qr code website did not specify which item sold out and the staff had to make guesses after 3 to 4 times to and fro from my seat to the cashier. Delayed the ordering process by 5 to 10 mins. Mentaiko salmon sushi was nice but the app needs better coding than just showing item #3360 sold out..something like that. Coin machine was down as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwa2I3ZVJ3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"From the qr code scanning to the food, it was hard to find a moment to appreciate. It took awhile to load the menu from the qr code alone, and even the simplest salmon sashimi which required no cooking was tasteless and not fresh. The fried items were slightly better but the entire menu wasn't worth the price. Everything could be enjoyed at a higher quality and lower price at Sushi Express."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNXVHQjFRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"One of my favorite branch. Food is great and value for price.
Must order Salmon Belly very good. Geso karaage is huge. I enjoyed the mentaiko sushis too. Everything we tried was nice. However, menu changed and there's no chasiu rice anymore.
FREE ice water, Wasabi and soy sauce available on request.  Generally not crowded on weekday lunch. Spend more than $20 to get a coin to play claw machine for ice cream.

Update: new item like steam osyter is a must try!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bl9xTkp3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"This is definitely an affordable and family friendly Japanese restaurant at Jurong Point.

15 minutes waiting time for weekday lunch. Always see a long queue on weekend. The salmon is very fresh and nice! The quality of foods are similar to Ichiban, but the price is slight cheaper."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2clpTTkxREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"Your money is better spent at Genki. Decent quality but a lot more rice:topping ratio.

Makes up for it with speedy service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbGF5NExREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"We accidentally dropped our house key in the restaurant and only realized it when we were reaching home. That time was already after 1030pm. Luckily, the store manager was still around and she answered our call. They did pick up our keys while clearing the table. We were grateful that she was willing to stay back and waited for us to return back to the outlet to collect our keys.

Truly appreciated."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb0p2R0JnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"Good sushi. Decent priced. Will come back again. Has lots of items on the menu, decently priced. Has inari items on menu(most places only sell inari+rice only) they have quite a lot of options for inari. Handroll with Avocado is available as well. First time having black colored tobiko here as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpX28tSXlRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Frankly not the best sushi operator, but unlike other reviewers, I did enjoy my sushi dinner in Sushi-Go. Ordered the food and most of our orders came within 15 mins? That’s fast. Hot food served hot, fresh food served fresh. But just thought the Japanese rice was alittle too thick in taste. Requested the staffs to help us top up the green tea powder a few times, they were quite prompt too. Price and quality 👍🏼.

Thought it would be great to have more food choices, for e.g. Fried food; like fries perhaps?
More chawanmushi selections?

Overall, Place was clean, pleasant to have dinner. With every $20 spend, you get a play at the claw machine.. oh ya, u only have 20 seconds at the claw machine ya."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaU9YWXR3RRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"Due to delays in their QR Code order taking system, customers had issues submitting their order entries, most of them had to signal to the servers to manually key in the entries. After that, some of the orders were delayed. Some of our orders  delayed, some  only arrived after the customer( who sat next to me) left. Sushi train got stuck half way for a few dishes. Staff hv to manually go and get it to the customers. Hope they resolved the problem soon.

Positive note: The waitresses tried hard to be helpful in helping us when all the above technical issues affected the food ordering and the promptness of the food arrival process. Kudos and dedicate the two stars for them.

Downside: The temperature of the restaurant was too cold and customers were made to  feel hungry and cold  at the same time. One of my most unpleasant experience as a customer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMXRUT2FnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,"Its more for kids. The lay out, menu choice, automatic food delivery trains, plush soft toy collectibles etc...The portions are small. Tiny bowls of rice/noodles. Typical adult will need 2 portions (cost about the same as any typical Japanese restaurant in Singapore). They also give out tokens for the claw machine located outside the restaurant. But its almost impossible to win/grab the ice cream out of the claw machine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTLWN6R1NREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Delicious Japanese food. Genki sushi idea. Food quality is slightly cheaper than genki and almost as good as genki, but I’ll still feel that genki taste better. Food preparing can be slightly longer. 5 stars if the timing for food to come is faster. Quality is good enough for this price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHR5SnNBRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"The Sushi standard is way better than those from other competitive well known sushi rivals. Fresh, made to order, reasonable priced.
I am impressed with the ramen and udon portion size which is relatively small but they also charged it below $4, ideally enables you to have ample stomach space to still try out their other food items  in the comprehensive menu.
Will surely visit again for any sushi crave in the future.
*Given 4 stars as i think their service speed can be further improve, but might be due to the current Covid-19 situation which affected their manpower*"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjd0wzMF9nRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"It's first time to try at this restaurant newly open in Jurong Point.

Firstly, the concept is good that we can order the food in system and food will deliver right to your table. So far most of the food quite tasty, I like the ice cream also. For me, the room of improvement is selection of items can be more.

Hopefully along the way, the menu will getting more items selection in future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dk02Z3Z3RRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,"Waited 15 minutes from 1.15 to 1.30 and no one serve us to the table. Other patrons also chasing for their food. Both the kitchen and waiters are short of staff and its just normal weekday lunch at 1.15! A bit unacceptable. In the end the waitress say if we cannot wait, then better not eat in so we left. Disappointed..if you are not ready for service, say in advance. Or otherwise get more staffs to cover during the lunch hour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejliZTRRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,Pretty low quality fish for average price. The cooked foods were okay but I was hoping to enjoy sushi. Sashimi portions were ridiculous and did not match the picture at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z0w3NURBEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,"Food literally takes forever to come. Staff was really rude as well when i asked for orders that weren’t here. I’ve visited this place several times and i never get good service here. Either my food takes very long, i ask for my food and i get bad attitude from staff or they just take forever to sit me down at my table even when there isn’t a lot of people. Worst sushi place ever.. Never coming back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z0lMenpnRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"I was a late boomer. Never the one to go after trends amd i am easy to satisfy. So long food is in my stomach i am happy :)

Got to know about sushi-go and was totally addicted over it! Loved the varieties of sushi they have and did i mentioned the wallet friendly sushis, rice and ramens???

Must go! Now it is a place for all my celebrations. Pray tell they do not raise prices anytime soon!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdU5xT1F3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,"Place was literally empty at 5pm and i found out why.

You order from your own phone, had difficulty ordering due to some bugs. Almost wanted to leave after 3 failed attempts. They copied Genki Sushi delivery by train which is a gimmick.

Food took sometime to come, powdered green tea is awful. These has got to be the smallest pieces of sushi i've gotten from a restaurant and the takoyaki has the size of small fishballs came cold and hard.

I would skip this joint for better variety and quality at sushi express."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LTlyRDR3RRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,"Food is not terrible. But, order for only 9 items, took 1.5hour before all dishes are served. Be careful if you want to eat here in saturday after 8pm"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjluQWNnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,Very attentive staff. Outlet manager remembered me when I had some ice left in the middle of the chicken meatball ordered from previous visit. She was remembered me and offered a free portion of meatball but I decline as it is we were full. Takes feedback seriously and acts upon it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdmRfWVlREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"1. First the concept is attractive and interesting.
2. However, the udon is too salty and got light soya bean sauce smell overpowering.
3. The fish got fishy smell
4. The cutting of the fish not properly cut as can eat some part of the fish that is hard.
5. The table is already so small and service provider can’t even cleared the table proactively"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX0otaWRnEAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),1,"Nothing special in particular. The chawanmushi was served cold 😡 and the green tea is powder form (hot water drips very slowly while you tries to fill your cup). Not recommended. That said, the claw machine to catch desserts for every $20 spent provides some family entertainment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejRXYjlRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"The spoons were dirty, came with small pieces of what looked like leftover food… Chawanmushi is decent. Tonkatsu ramen tasted like cup noodles. Can be better! But reasonably priced and service staff helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dTgycDdRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Sushi is not bad! I spent ard $20 (including taxes) ordered ard 6-7 plates of sushi. Minus one star bc for e new range of sushi that is supposed to have some butter on top of e salmon/scallop, the butter given was so tiny that I could not taste it. Otherwise e slices of salmon are fat enough for e price :)
It will be great also if their ice cream claw machine stocks some Meiji icecream instead also. (Understand that made in Japan ice-creams might be too expensive to maintain in the long run so even Taiwanese-made Meiji is much better than the dubious looking icecream inside)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5b2J2YzV3RRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"Very interesting, fun Dinning experience,
Sushi 🍣 very  nice . price  from $1.8 a salmon Sushi.
Bring your children come and experience a unique fun dinning ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4c3BYU1dREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),2,"TLDR; food was average, the ordering system leaves questions about its service. It has a literal pre-requisite to use a smart phone and a qr reader at this shop, which seems a little strange. A customer shouldn't have to feel conflicted by such a process to eat & order food.

Overall, the food portions are pretty standard, the taste was alright. Though upon entry i was given 2 packets of soya sauce & a packet of wasabi, as well as a QR code & a printed guide to ordering food.

While the menus work and are neatly sorted into categories (nigiri, sashimi etc.), it seems I couldn't order for more soya sauce packets nor wasabi. Everything was controlled to prevent wastage, but yet you couldnt order more? This probably explained the lack of amenities across the tables in the shop.

Ordered food was served using the ""train"" plate delivery system, very much akin to genki sushi's system. Though the wait for food was a little longer than expected. I ordered 3 plates initially, 2 arrived within 5 mins, but the 3rd came almost 10 mins after i was done with the first 2 items. I ordered 2 more items and it took about another 10 mins before they were served. The service overall was too slow in my opinion. I wanted to double check on ny orders but noted the store front had about 2 staff in front, whom had much to manage with waiting queues, customers paying their bills & cleaning the tables. It seems they are understaffed in their store front area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMTVENFBREAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"I was greeted by a warm smile and greetings by the people working there. Love the fact that they immediately offered soy sauce and wasabi. Great service!

The wait for the food was fairly short, about 10mins. The sushi quality was abit lower compared to genki but it was cheaper! Nonetheless, the sushi was tasty!! However, you can taste the mushiness of the salmon.

The Zaru soba ( cold soba) was pretty average. They changed from serving dipping sauce and noodles to just serving you a bowl of cold soba dipped in sauce. I was pretty bummed about that :(

Lastly, the crispy salmon skin ($1.80) were really tasty and cheap! Really worth the price just for a snack. Overall a good experience, definitely bring my friends there :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdzVLY3RRRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),4,"Nice ambience. Friendly and fast service. The""food shuttle"" is gimmicky, but it does speed up the service.
Food is average. Matcha powder for your green tea is a welcome so you can adjust the concentration to your taste.
Prices are reasonable for the place and service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNczQtenVBRRAB,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),3,The concept reminded me of Genki Sushi. The variety is not comparable but in term of price and shorter waiting time I will vote for this restaurant. Their queue is so much shorter. I will recommend the black pepper series sushi and the fried prawn.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb3VIVEZ3EAE,Sushi-GO (Jurong Point),5,"The queue speaks for itself, extensive menu of quality sushi, though slightly pricey.

Full fledged restaurant with ramen and don offerings in their menu, atop the usual sushi and sashimi, not to mention their kids meal which is served in a different plate and presentation!

They also have a unique way of serving their dishes, whereby customers places their order via an online platform found on a QR code, and is served by a robotics train system, a truly good fit for COVID period.

Will definitely return in future given the wide selection and fair price point 👍🏻"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3JxM0hREAE,Kotobuki,4,Perhaps the oldest restaurant still standing among all in the area. Sushi/sashimi platter was quite fresh. Worth giving it a try. Beef served in sizzling hot plate. Sake was given a decanter and chilled in bucket of ice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTZfc2dRRRAB,Kotobuki,5,"Used to work in Jurong and this was the go to place beside Jurong Hill Park, for a Japanese lunch.

Surprised to see that the restaurant is still doing well after 20 years, even though all the other establishments around the same area have gone to the pits. Sure it needs a new coat of paint but something tells me it’s not going to happen.

We ordered sashimi, tonkatsu don and grilled chicken set. Food still tastes good although prices have gone up a lot. The sashimi was fresh and thick cut, not the thin slivers of fish you get else where. The grilled chicken (salted, not teriyaki) was a little under cooked in some parts but mostly okay. The tonkatsu was crunchy with every bite and juicily tender inside.

I strongly recommend this old school Japanese restaurant for a simple no frills Japanese meal. Great value for money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eXF5RVZBEAE,Kotobuki,5,"Definitely not your usual conveyor Japanese restaurant. We chanced on this hidden gem, located in the western part of Singapore. We ordered the salmon belly sashimi (Sake Harami) to share. Dish came with 6 slices of sashimi. The slices were thick and fresh. Immediately melted in my mouth. Damn delicious. Wifey and me then ordered a Deluxe Kaisen Don each. It’s a rice dish with egg, crab sticks, raw scallops, prawns, tuna and salmon. Topped with I believe salmon roe and uni (sea urchin). This dish was fabulous. It was so fresh and definitely filling. I washed it down with a nice bottle of warm sake. Abit pricey but definitely worth every dollar. Will recommend not to order too many dishes first as the portion is pretty big and the richness of the dishes will leave you satisfied quickly. Ample parking available so no worries about parking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNzdMVjFRRRAB,Kotobuki,4,"Established more than 30 years, a very homely ambience, good food and reasonable price. Love their Saba fish and grilled squid. Children love the garlic fried rice and tempura udon. Please make a reservation to avoid disappointment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeDczVDN3RRAB,Kotobuki,3,"One of the more popular Japanese resturant with Japanese at the west area

Serve quite an array of Japanese food here
They also give a good range of lunch sets

Therefore you won’t have any problem finding what you want to eat

Staffs also attentive to refill your drinks

I could have gone more of my yakitori but it was ok.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd0ttdWNnEAE,Kotobuki,1,"I dont usually write google reviews for food places unless it’s exceptionally good but THIS RESTAURANT…

Decided to visit this restaurant after reading all the good reviews on google but it turned out to an utter disappointment.

Was greeted with a weird mouldy stench when we stepped into the shop and the interior is a bit run down. Staff were not friendly and made us feel that they don’t wanna work anymore lol.

All the rice bowls on the menu looked so generous so we were very excited, however upon the arrival of our food, we were shocked and disappointed. $26 for a palm size rice bowl? Ps, I have small palm so imagine how small it is.

Trying to stay positive, we told ourselves maybe the food quality really superb. After taking a few bites on their sashimi, we looked at each other with disappointment. Not only it’s not fresh, had a few with fish scale and bones in it. We then moved on to eating the rice thinking it wouldn’t go wrong. I mean, ITS PLAIN SUSHI RICE. To our dismay, the rice doesn’t even taste like sushi rice??? There’s no vinegar taste AT ALL. It’s VERY STICKY, I think it’s glutinous rice???

Miso soup tastes worse than the ones I get from donki and the soya sauce is so salty it doesn’t even taste like the usual sashimi soya sauce they serve in restaurants???

In the end, although the dishes weren’t cheap, we really cannot bring ourselves to finish the food. ITS THAT HORRIBLE. I love my chirashi dons and I’ve never not been able to finish them but this restaurant really outdid themselves.

If you are looking for quality Japanese food, this restaurant ain’t it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtam91d3hBRRAB,Kotobuki,4,"Feels like being transported back to an old izakaya in Japan (now that we can’t travel). Set lunch was good with free coffee, nice ambience, service is good. At night it turns into an izakaya. A rare find in that vicinity."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaDk3WkpnEAE,Kotobuki,4,"Really nice interior! Went there pass the happy hour, the food can get quite pricey although the portion was definitely worth the price. The salmon mega don was really big and the salmon slices were quite thick. Would recommend to try that!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlejZXQXl3RRAB,Kotobuki,4,Regular hangout. Authentic Japanese restaurant. Favourite rice bowl. Friendly staffs. Price a little on the high side. But will still go back for the good food. 😀

Love the wide array of sake🍶 & shochu🥃."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMHUtMGpRRRAB,Kotobuki,3,"The only nice dish is the UNAGI Roll. Their fish is cooked perfectly, moist and seasoned lightly. The tonkatsu was dry and thin with a thick coating. The other sides dishes were average. However the price is on the high side even through there are at a secluded area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTa05uZUJREAE,Kotobuki,4,Weekdays lunch promotions are a steal. Food quality is comparative to most other well established Japanese restaurants.  Prices are competitive and comparable. Its not a super big restaurant. So go there early or make reservations.  You will be surprised by the lunch crowd.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbW9hbHB3RRAB,Kotobuki,5,"Great food. The sashimi is very value for money as the cuts are very thick. Tempura is crispy, yums.

The place is right beside Sheng Shiong. It has an old school charm to it.

The place was packed on a Saturday night, had to wait 45 mins for our food when we placed order at 7.15pm. Come earlier if you have kids in the group.

They had bookshelves full of comics, but it’s all in Japanese language 😅"

Food is at least 4 stars, and value for money with the 20% discount as we ordered before 7pm on a weekday

But service is 3 stars at best because they appear shorthanded.

Lots of Japanese clientile that looked like regulars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtN3BQeFJnEAE,Kotobuki,1,"Food standard has drop drastically, it’s about 20-30% of their usual standard. Bluefin grilled jaw was not fresh, beef was subpar chewy for price paid, miserable small piece, taste like rejected beef from supplier. Yakisoba which is suppose to be a easy cook was mushy and tasteless.

Always like going to this restaurant but today was a real disappointment.

However service staff was attentive, that was the only saving grace."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3BEV3JRRRAB,Kotobuki,1,The service and food is from bad to worse.. 3 simple dishes are served separately with an interval of 10mins in between. Not going back again..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLajlmLTZ3RRAB,Kotobuki,2,"Foods were nice. But overall standard has dropped. Step in restaurant before 8pm which is less crowded. Ordered simple Kaisen don, Maki, Tempura which do not need long time to prepare. Waited more than 30mins for the first don served. Maki is yet to serve after an hour. I don't understand why take so long to prepare the food when the shop left merely customers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a05iY2d3RRAB,Kotobuki,5,Food was great! Loved the Chirashi don
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN1lHNHRnRRAB,Kotobuki,5,Very nice traditional japanese food and traditional setting out
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OGJtMU53EAE,Kotobuki,1,"Bad experiences, Was seated around 6plus and ordered the foods. We waited almost 1 hour and when I asked the staff to check, she said ok checked but she didn’t come back to me. i have to walk to her and  told her that I wished to change to takeaway or else then canceled. She didn’t canceled my order and asked me to wait for take away, I asked her how long, she didn’t reply me on the waiting time just told me to wait. Again, I waited another 15 minutes. I was in the hurried to return something to someone else and I told the counter staff, I will canceled my order and left in a hurry with fuming and hungry state.  Utterly disappointed with them. Last time, the foods was served fast around 20 minutes but today I waited for an hour. Won’t go back again.  😡😡😡😡"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaEpqeTVnRRAB,Kotobuki,5,"Shashimi is fresh. Reasonably priced. Surprise to find such good quality Japanese food at this place. Cosy, quiet place n good food. No need to travel to Orchard Road if you crave for Japanese food. Will return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrOTZ2YlZREAE,Kotobuki,1,"Been patronizing this outlet for few years. However, standard has been dropping. Especially with more residents shifting to the nearby flats and condos, the service crews attitude is really bad. No smile. And ever waited more than 1 hour for our dinner to be served. After checking with the crews a few times as kiddos are really hungry, they will tell you off saying that why you come at peak hour? (it was close to 8pm) Our kitchen are short handed with just 1 chef. And today, the rice that they served is mixed with short grain and Thailand rice. To cut cost, maybe. Just felt that it does not deserve to our continuous support anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaDl1NjJ3RRAB,Kotobuki,2,"Having bad dining experience with this restaurant, the soup is super duper salty like drinking msg and the drinks was too sweet. This is my first time to leave my review on google, to me food Costly and tasteless! Will not go back again☹️. If really want to say, the service provided still okay."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM2Mydk5BEAE,Kotobuki,5,"Good food, price very reasonable, service friendly. Waiting time slightly longer when evening happy hour is on."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMjRIbDN3RRAB,Kotobuki,2,"Good sashimi, below average tempura, nice beef. Service is extremely slow. Even when the restaurant has 2 tables seated, it took them 40min to prepare a set meal after repeated checks. Do not visit unless you have time to kill."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdmM2TGZBEAE,Kotobuki,5,"Firstly, we went there with no expectation as it was an impromptu visit and I didn't do any homework which I normally do. It was also to celebrate my better half's birthday and it was a nice substitute for where we initially wanted to go (Tanoshii ) but couldn't as it didn't accept young kids. Good service and nice space allowance. Nicely litted. I would give a 5 for the unagi as it really hit the spot. Don't expect a wonderful presentation like in the other restaurant. Why it is a 4 was more with tempura. It is not horrible but up to the 5 rating level. I will pay a visit for the chirashi and raw food to see if they can hit my 5 rating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX19HOUlREAE,Kotobuki,1,"Food so so. Considering the location and old rundown condition of the place , price is high. They run out of char siew but didn't mentioned until serving the ramen, simply replaced with chicken with an take it or leave it attitude. No more repeat visit..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbnNTWFBBEAE,Kotobuki,3,It’s reasonably priced and they often have additional offers but that’s the best that can be said of it. Food quality is decidedly average at least for their Chirashi Don. But what can you expect really for do it all budget Japanese places? Eat here if it’s convenient for you and if you are on a budget but otherwise you’d be better off at a less budget place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWFQbWN3EAE,Kotobuki,4,Old school authentic Japanese cuisine that has been around for a long long time...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOE4zWnZnRRAB,Kotobuki,5,"I usually like my food cooked well, hence #Sashimi is just not my kind of food. Plus i am very sensitive to fishy smell, the slightest smell will just explode in my nose when the fish is not fresh. But... I'm about to change that. #ConfidenceRegained

First time having a #ChirashiDon, i must say i am pleasantly surprised, especially when paired with #GrilledUnagu. Even ate a few slices of #Salmon, #SwordFish, #YellowTail and #Tuna (no mercury-like taste 👍🏻👍🏻).
.
Loved their #DeepFriedOctopus, goes well with #Mayonnaise (available upon request). The #BbqEggRolls are pretty tasty too.

So glad that we have a decent #JapaneseRestaurant here in the #West, #TamanJurong. #Kotobuki is a great gem serving great #JapanseCuisine.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcFBhTmlBRRAB,Kotobuki,1,"Ordered Ramen, Soba tempura, udon tempura and mixed grilled skewers.
Service: Good but food prep/cooking was slow. waited almost 20-30 mins.
Quality: Ramen broth and dipping sauces (soba/udon) were watered down. Flavor lost already. Grilled skewers were okay. Salt/Pepper/Teriyaki sauce
Green tea and complimentary black coffee was satisfactory.
Price: 80$++ with tax
Verdict: Spend your money elsewhere"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzlYSXpBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,This restaurant has a large menu from Japan's Tohoku region. We ordered a couple of set dinners and a grilled squid. They come with a food warmer beneath. It's best to let the warm warm up. The steak was well marinated and soft. The squid was not to my liking. It was okay but slightly fishy. All in all a decent dinner on the average side.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0ozYnZnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),2,"The restaurant provide great variety and the taste was ok. It was a short queue for weekend lunch. Green tea is refillable. The kids utensil and cup are not properly clean, I doubt if they disinfect the utensils."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LTlXaS13RRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"Firstly, it was long queue during dinner time, so the expectation was got very high.    The food was ok and hot pot quite good. The value was deducting from utensils didn’t supply. When waitress finish my order, then she didn’t supply utensils to us, that is after our meals arrived. we request from the service table. Secondly, the waiters is supply wrong meal frequently. The worst is there have two big fly surrounding, feel so unhygienic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLXNqalJREAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),2,"Stood at the waiting line around 5pm, nobody was there to serve us for quite some time. The service not up to standard. Most of the dishes were served either warm or cold, only the green tea was hot, everything here was underwhelming. Total damage $85++"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMWJMeV9BRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"food is delicious as usual. refer to photos. restaurant seems to be understaffed, but they took our orders accurately n timely.

The set meal here are affordable priced. Most of them come with Chawanmushi, Rice, Miso Soup and Sashimi. My chicken nanban set come with tempura soft shell crab 😋 The tartar sauce goes very well with chicken and salmon is thickly sliced and fresh. Chawanmushi was just normal.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEo3UHhBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Decent Japanese-style food. Visited on a weekday afternoon, didn’t have to wait long. Service was friendly and effificient. Preferred the previous version of fried salmon skin where it was thinner and crispier. I took the oyster nabe, tasted comforting and there was a surprising amount of oysters as well though there was just a few strands of Japanese vermicelli."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHNuT3dBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),1,"Disappointing experience. The fish+spicy fish roe from the seasonal menu which I ordered came with raw parts in the fish. I only realised the raw parts halfway through my meal. After I checked with the waitress, she took the plate and said she'd ""return it to the kitchen"", without waiting for a response.

After 10minutes, the plate was just thrown on my table, with the waitress mumbling ""不好意思啊"" (""sorry ah"") and walked away, again without waiting for any response. And guess what, the fish came back still in its half eaten form (photo attached), albeit cooked more thoroughly. In this COVID-19 climate, not sure if putting back a half-eaten fish on the grill is a good idea.

There was obviously no room for discussion on the possible service recovery. No sincere apologies given, no offering of any compensation. Even though it is a grave issue regarding food safety."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUlpeWRnEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),1,"I used to like Ichiban Boshi, but i am so disappointed this time. The ika yaki (grilled squid) is so small, it is so different from what I ate last time, and from the menu too. This is the first time (in my memory) that I immediately complained to a waiter on their food. That waiter called a lady and immediately they took it away. 10 minutes, the lady sent back the ika with additional few more pieces (the whiter ones in the left of the picture) and said they added more for me, then mumbling that it is 150g while walking away...

The taste is different from Japanese grilled squid, but more like a sambal sotong.

I am disappointed with the food. Wondering if this is  single case issue, or overall the standard of this branch dropped.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OGNhTWhRRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,Not the best Japanese restaurant and guess this is what I can expect in Jurong Point. Price range is normal and tasted ok. First time I tried set meal and this time around I ordered ala carte. Service was good and less crowd. They sell sushi and sashimi at the entrance if you opt for a takeaway. Hotate sashimi was not bad but slightly thin. Total bill $40.37 for one pax.

I have been served by uncle Charles who are very patient and provide exceptional service to us. Uncle Charles provided prompt service when we needed. He also offered to help us take picture. Other than that, he are attentive to our needs and pour for us tea when we finished it. I really enjoyed his service. His service make my day and I have recommend my friends and family to Ichiban Jurong Point to eat.

I hope that you can award him with awards or give him recognition as he leave me a good impression about Ichiban Boshi. His service impacted me greatly and I will visit Jurong Point outlet again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydnZmTU93EAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),2,"Haven't came in for a few years.
Quite taken aback overall drop in pretty much everything or I had a much rosier view back then when I was younger

Could tell they were understaffed right off the bat. Definitely got off from the wrong foot when they asked if I wanted wasabi and soy. I've never been asked that question ever anywhere else in my entire life in a Japanese restaurant when you order anything with raw fish

What would you expect the answer to be and what situation led to such a question in the first place ?

Doesn't help when it turned up with the blot of wasabi marinating itself in a saucer of sauce . This was  already pointed out by other reviewers and even with responses from the management, if there's no change its pretty clear things are not going to change . So please don't drop some message after this ""you'll look into it ""

Notice that tea ? It says refillable in the menu . But that's not the issue,  I choose that in spite of the fact i have utmost confidence it wouldn't be refilled because that's the standard you pretty much expect of the service staff nowadays

What I hadn't counted on is staff passing by checking the mug, peeping down at it throughout the meal 4 to 5 times  and not doing anything about it . I'm fine if your standard of service precludes refills but the repeated visits was as useful as asking me if I wanted wasabi .

One of the reviewers hit the nail on the head when this was described as something like a zhi char restaurant.  Everything feels like a tired  Chinese restaurant here"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlM1p5Z1dBEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,"Been a regular patron of Ichiban for many years with my family - possibly close to a decade. Mostly at JP branch.

Other than the occasional long queues during peak hours, there has not been much of a disappointment or bad experience so far.

The quality of food have never failed us and it isn’t too over-priced. There will always be suitable dishes for the young and old, and even vegetarian.

Wanted to commend a staff who left a very good impression on me. Visited the Jurong Point branch on 18 Sep for lunch with my family. The section service staff (Uncle) Charles was really warm and attentive. He would constantly be looking to serve the tables with prompt and smallest gestures and checking to maintain his service corner to be ready and neat. Impressed with his professionalism."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaExiUG5nRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Like it especially when most of their food quality re pretty consistent at all their outlets. Fresh quality ingredients used! Extensive menu and huge serving. Always find ourselves sharing the hotpot meal. I like their ika tempura. It tasted incredibly delicious topping it off with the Wasabi Mayo! Just a note to highlight, although the service was relatively prompt, but the waiting time of the food was slightly longer than usual. Meanwhile, remember to scan your RE&S membership upon making payment if you are one too! 👍🏼

Updated with more photos on 5 April."

Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Price: 3/5
Decor & seating: 3/5

Highly recommend stewed beef cubes. Grilled salmon a tad too salty.
Unagi sushi was not bad.
Swordfish belly was on point based on taste and texture.
Momo peach ice cream was yucks.
Sesame ice cream passable.

Service was so-so, not proactive which means tea pretty much unfilled and finished dishes not cleared promptly. Fortunately staff still attended upon request."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNHBXcjJRRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"Had a chance to have lunch at Ichiban today... Had ordered the Saba and rice as a simple dish for myself.

When the fish came, i taste it and feels cold and the fish is like not grill and doesn't taste fresh...
Spoken to the floor manager, Mau whom was a nice lady whom came and make a replacement on the Saba.

2nd pieces of Saba came but to no changes... warm but could feel the meat is so hard which shouldn't be (see pic). Mau came to ask for review of the fish but she knew it wasn't good.. she initiated to change to Salmon. Meanwhile, she apologised and gave us a plate complimentary sushi..

Finally, the salmon came and the meal was completed.

I have to compliment the assistant manager named, Mau. She was very good and professional in serving customer and cater to their needs. Thanks Mau for making my experience worth while during the short period."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjlfM0hBEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),1,"Exceptional customer service from the elderly uncle here. However everyone else when he is not around is absolutely horrible. Manager walks passes avoiding eye contact so she doesn’t have to attend to customers wanting to make orders. Other staff looks like they are overworked or just woken up, it’s a pain to get any of their attention, even when the store is less than 20 percent filled. Hit or miss experience here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVLUtxcWdnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Japanese styled restaurant provides good value food for family, kids menu available which they would love to order.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjZPWVNBEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,"Greeted with friendly waiters and waitress, meals are served around 15mins after order.

Ordered bento set and Food were tasty. There were seats during weekday lunch and do not need to wait too long"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrLWRhUHpBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Second time visiting this outlet here at Jurong Point. It was a Sunday and needless to say, there’s quite a queue.. The “waiting area” was pretty warm and could do with some ventilation.

The waitress who attended to us was probably new as she had to went back and forth consulting her colleagues each time I ordered a different sushi on a different category. I would suggest to provide iPad on every table, like what many other establishments already are doing, so to convenience us consumers. Because fact is, she keyed in the wrong order for one of them, and it tasted awful 🤢

I have to highlight the fact that the soft shell crab is a must-have given that it is actually crispy, and actually contains crab meat! I’m really surprised and regretted not going for another round..

All in all, the food was good and the price reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMmRpRkpBEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Probably one of the largest store in the island. Lots of varieties to. Goose from .. sashimi, sushi, grilled fish, Tempura and with high quality fish like blue fin tuna sashimi and Uni! Lovely place to have casual dining but the waiter and waitress needs to be more attentive. The oyster with cheese and special sauce taste funny with bitter after taste! The quality of the food is quite good and price is reasonable. Good for family too.!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dlBXNHVnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"It's another weekend coming to an end. Decided to travel all the way to Jurong Point for lunch and ended up at Ichiban Boshi.

We ended up here because it was busy everywhere. Too many people in this mall.

Anyway, our lunch was just okay. I remembered that Ichiban had a much better quality but maybe that was years ago.

The menu definitely changed a little. I was hoping for a good lunch but got an okay okay lunch instead.

So what went wrong today? Firstly they served our soya sauce with wasabe in it. That's not Japanese at all. That's a Singaporean thing. Never do that!

Secondly, my SOBA was served room temperature. This should have been served chilled.

Thirdly, the Karei Karaage was not crispy as it should have been. This was rather disappointing but the flavors with pretty good.

The food didn't turn out so great but our waiter was amazing. He really took good care of us. He made sure our drinks were always full and he was very attentive.

Kudos to him!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbG9xZHVnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Food was alright, not stunning. I got a hotpot with beef and the beef tasted great, although there could've been a bit more soup. Also, remember to check your receipt - I was charged for something I didn't order and paid about $7 more than I should have. The service staff (an uncle) was very nice though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDlIaFN3EAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,"Same good quality food and service as their other locations. Extensive menu, reasonable price, good quality ingredients, prompt service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDQzdm53RRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,"been to numerous ichiban boshi across the island, this one always has the best service. service staff are always warm, friendly, and welcoming. some even check up on you to ask whether the food is alright. imho, if you're at japanese street and don't know what to eat, just go to ichiban boshi. it's the most ""worth-it"" japanese restaurant to go to at japanese street in jurong point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOHZTTElBEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"The sushi off the conveyer belt tastes a bit stale but the menu items are pretty good. It’s a little pricy and I expected more from the food.

Service staff was friendly but a little slow to respond due to the small amount of floor staff working with a huge holiday crowd."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNHBUM2xRRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"We accidentally ordered a chef recommended cold udon, with sesame dressing. It tasted weird, we did not like it. Sea urchin was not that fresh. The beef Don could not compare with average restaurants out there. The only decent dish we had was the sashimi.

Perhaps these few dishes cannot justify this restaurant's standard. Because it is very popular among locals, we had to queue for our seat. And other customers that ordered their bento sets seemed to enjoy their food. However, do avoid the dishes we ordered as they weren't pleasant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbTVTaHJBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,"I personally love this Japanese restaurant very much, and usually go there for dinner over once a month. The food is fresh and tasty, the atmosphere is relaxing too. The price is roughly 25-40 SGD per person."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHUzSGp3RRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,The venue is big and spacious. The staffs working on that day have been attentive and responsive to our table requests. The food was great too. Awesome experience for our family that day.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMVBDTkN3EAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,"Extensive menu with wide variety of set meal options. Had the mentaiko salmon paired with sashimi salad set meal, comes with soup and chawamushi. Pretty filling. Service could be better, was seated at a corner and had a hard time getting the waiter/waitresses’ attention."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdTU2Ml9RRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,Good ambient and service staffs. Ingredients used are fresh. Good choices in the menu.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURValpHQmdnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),1,"Empty tables available but not letting people in. Purposely creating long queue. If they are understaffed, management should do something about it. Having a queue outside with empty tables in the restaurant is ridiculous!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMkxhWlh3EAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),5,The set meal comes with many different varieties of ingredients and the experience is just wonderful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna2N6V2xnRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,Ichiban Boshi have good lunch deals and the food is alright. However if without lunch promotion the price of the food would be quite pricey and i would suggest eating something else. There are better food around Jurong Point
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNDdia2tBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),1,Been here at least 5 times. Service is below the industry standard. Waited 1 hour for my food. Poor communication between servers and kitchen staff. Staff appear busy but do nothing.  Ask for wasabi but they never return. Not interested in serving you or taking your order unless you call them. Overall a very lousy experience and I suspect its poor management at this outlet!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeWNHdHpBRRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,We have the pleasure of Charles serving us this evening. He was very attentive to our needs. Haven't had such good service in a long long time. Thank you very much! 🙏
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbXJLQy13RRAB,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),4,"Good service and food overall. Unfortunately, half of the veg in the salad we got was baf and inedible. However we usually never have a problem with our orders 👍🏽"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaUp2N2NnEAE,Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point),3,Food was fine but they screwed up having the kids meals served late and last...

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbktpR1JREAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Great service and super friendly staff. Told them our pork jowl is over cooked, too hard and burnt. The manager offered to give us a new plate.

Both my parent and I like to eat their salmon and prawn don (either with mentaiko or without).

Highly recommend this outlet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMnBYb3NRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Visited on a Sat for dinner. Ordering is done via the QR code. Had the pork bowl, Australian wagyu bowl & salmon sashimi. The pork was very tender with a rich flavour from the marinade. Beef was way too tough and not worth it. 10/10 would not order again as there are better places for beef. Service is pleasant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNzhiemhnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Used to love it, but feels that the standard has dropped. The meat seems over tenderizer till it doesn't taste like meat anymore. Come mainly for their Foie Gras, luckily the Foie Gras still ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cFlTTmFnEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Highly recommend for Iberico Hoho Don. Meat is so tender,  juicy and smoky. The taste and texture is so good! Make me want to come back to eat again! The staff is friendly and  good service. I think they should hire more staff. Always crowded and busy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNEtpMDBRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Late lunch after 2pm on a public holiday, no queue. Scan menu to order. Like the ability to add salad $2 to the dons which come with miso soup (seaweed, tofu & clams). The 3 kinds buta jyu $23 bbq pork - good flavourful fats and the wagyu suji don - tender beef stew $18.90 were the preferred ones. Wagyu stamina Don - grilled beef $23.90 was ok too but a little tougher..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXJhUGt3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Maybe there is a stand in kitchen crew.  The food is a far cry from the Vivo branch.   Even the way the food is prep seems different- our chicken / pork seems to be prep in advance and then reheated via pan fried or microwaved.  And there’s hardly sauce on top although it tasted salty.  Will not be coming again even if we are now living nearer to Jem than Vivo.

One word of caution for the owner- with an open space open-open dine-in your staff do need to watch out for patrons to ensure no free riders who eat and go without paying 😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cnNLV093EAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"So good!! The pork was super tender and soft and not overly sweet, while the sashimi was super fresh and sliced thick enough too! Visited on a sat lunch, was crowded but didnt have to wait long for the food to be served. Will definitely be back to try the other dons.

Edit: 2nd visit and dropped to 4 stars. I'm not too sure why it didnt come with miso soup and sides this time round. Wondering if it was missed out or it is only for lunch. Was very satisfied with the sashimi as it was thick cut and very fresh, but sadly disappointed with the squid as the sauce was way too much and making it overly sweet. The squid was actually cooked to perfection though.. not too chewy. I will still go back again to try more mains and hopefully give back the 1 star again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXAyZTVRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Have been here a few times and was never disappointed with the food. Ordered Wagyu Stamina Don with Foie Gras, Chicken Nanban Don & 3 Kinds Sashimi this time. The dons were pretty good, but honestly the sashimi was the best! Each slice was fresh and thick, which is really worth it for $12.80 :-)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a1lyMXJnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,This Aburi outlet is conveniently located at the ground floor of Jem. The outlet faces Westgate Mall and is located at the entrance facing Westgate. The menu consist of a selection of Japanese food bowls and raw fish. Tried a few of the Japanese rice bowls. The helping is sufficient but not excessive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdWZHX1FnEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"New menu and WOW - it's great. The 3 fish appetiser is amazing, new fish donburi sets are great. I liked this place before but it was getting a bit boring... However, now it's like an old good place that just got refreshing and better. Well done!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbGVqMGxnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Had Buta don with onsen egg and Asari Miso Soup. Would be better with more sauce.

I was seated outdoor with live band playing from Tipsy Bunny just beside Aburi-EN. This is a good place to catch up with friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOW9yMzh3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Especially waryu beef good quality , highly recommended. Just wish the restaurant can hired more staffs , coz we wait for drink and the food around half hour"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOVluRXB3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Had the Chope deal which was the Premium Buta Don. The pork was so tender and juicy. The sauce was a little sweet and savoury. And that char on the meat was divine. Love it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcVotNkxBEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Aburi-EN may be known for their chargrilled meat donburi bowls, but their NEXT MEATS series are flavoursome too! Decided to try their 𝗡𝗘𝗫𝗧 𝗠𝗘𝗔𝗧 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝗞𝗮𝗿𝘂𝗯𝗶 𝗗𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗲𝘁 out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. For $13.80, it comes served with 5 sizeable pieces of grilled boneless short rib glazed with their special sauce, atop a bed of fluffy Japanese rice. Grilled over binchotan charcoal, the meat slices are tender and have a nice smoky char. Tastewise, the NEXT yakiniku meat pales slightly to the other meat alternatives BB has tried thus far, but the glaze more than makes up for it with a good balance of sweetness and umami & a subtle hint of ginger. Definitely a solid meat-free option for flexitarians or vegetarians. 👍🏻⁣"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbmE3anN3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"We were impressed by how delicious the plant-based option was, ramen was also good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaFpEOVRBEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),1,"We take away our food, we chose the Prem Buta Bara Don but when we opened it when we reached our house they only give the meat but no rice but in our receipt is we paid for the dish fully so it was supposed to be with rice. Very very disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhZ2VIdnZ3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"I frequently patronise EN Sakaba in Tanjong Pagar as it’s near my office so decided to order delivery through oddle. Was disappointed that the wagyu stamina Don was full of veggies, mushroom, and NOT beef. The buta don pork is tough. Only saving grace is the egg and edamame. Also, the delivery guy was late (supposed to be 6-6.30 but he only came at 6.40, somemore Jem isn’t very far from choa chu kang) 😢"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNnNDeEF3EAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),2,"I usually like this place, the food is very nice but yesterday was a bit of a disaster. I think they are understaffed, the scan qr menu didn't work so a member of staff took the order from the menu. Seemed to cause alot of problems, we started to get orders from other tables and nobody knew what we ordered for the whole meal. Staff were trying to solve the issue but we're very stressed out, we had to keep explaining what we ordered even though they took the original order down on paper. Had to keep asking for things also, no discount or anything offered when paying for the trouble :|

Staff were nice enough and willing to help but I probably won't go back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcnZDYXZRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),2,"The foods are bad as what we expected. Actually went over on Monday to try at Jurong outlet. Those meats (pork n beef) Wagyu are totally worst disappointment in meat quality n even a rice are over wet. Terrible Monday dinner.. Please have quality check on food
Service are not to standard, bring to our table yet no one came take order as one of us need to walk out to ask waiter to come over... Is it meant when we seat far away then none will come to take care of our order?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1N09EdlJREAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Amazing Japanese cuisine in the west. Their dons and gyozo are a big “must try” dishes. Can’t complain about service, they have automated the whole process of ordering thru the QR scan method, which I find very useful. It gets a bit crowded over the weekends, so watch out for that. Would suggest ask for outdoor seating than indoors. Overall a great place to add to your list of diners"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpa05qeWZ3EAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Not bad, the fish egg or roe is quite tasty, a bit salty but nice. The wagyu has a bit of sinewy fats lining, together with the eel, is quite good. The grilled squid is excellent. The rest are pretty above average stiff, toufu, sashimi, and the salad platter. Overall an above average meal. Good. :D"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eHNPQzhRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Overall good experience.
The grill food is well cooked not charred.
It's tender as well.
Minus one star is because charashi Don is not available today 😔 hence ordered sashimi to satisfied my cravings. Overall yummy 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLajlXLTR3RRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Quick friendly service. Food is good. Physical menu and we order by writing on the order chit. Located near one of the level 1 entrances in JEM. There is outdoor seating as well. As the place gets its air conditioning from the central air conditioning, it can be a bit warm at certain seats on a hot afternoon. Payment at the counter when we exit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdWZfZVJBEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Foodsssss are awesomely DELICIOUS….a bit pricey but worthy every buck….Ramen is so good and seafoods are perfectly cooked…staffs are great and place is conveniently located at Jem near the MRT. I will come back to this place again…🙂
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dHZpdnJRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),2,"Poor service, QR code to order food was not working, asked the staff she said she will order for me but she never gave me my order chit so I thought maybe she did order but they will give the order chit later. Waited for 15 mins nth came so I asked another staff(in red shirt) and it was only then did she order for me. So I waited for nothing and attitude was 0 stars, it was like I owed her money or something 🙄 it’s not that I expect top notch service or anything but at least treat people with respect"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPelpyNUVBEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"One of the really good Japanese restaurant chain, their pork rice bowls are nice, even better are the sashimi and salmon bowl with mentaiko sauce. Unfortunately their wagyu bowl are not really done well as the beef are a little chewy. Good place to chill with friends over some cold beer and nice Japanese food 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NXVMY3NRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Really good butadon, though we prefer the original one as compared to the premium iberico version which is more expensive, to each their own. The only downside was that it wasn’t filling since the portion was relatively small.

The ramen on the other hand, was really poor. The taste and portion were not up to mark at all.

That said, this is a plus for solely the butadon which is what they are famous for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NWZYNWZnEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"The pork is well marinated and fresh. Really enjoyed the taste and the ambience of this place. The matcha ice cream is yummy too, will come again😄😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMDhEUmdRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Well torched and polished meat. Not exactly mind blowing, but it is satisfactory - above average. Indoors (also ourdoors) are very well furnished and looks classy. Not exactly value for money (about 15+ for a bowl of Don), but acceptable for the quality. Crowd here is mostly working ppl"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMWFEaFNnEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Impressed by the food quality and the service provided! Value for money and worth it! However, there’s a few flies which quite annoys me during the dine."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN2RucDFBRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Slightly crowded during lunch time. Has a wide variety in their menu, includes miso soup and a side of pickles for their lunch timing (11am-5pm). Looks appetising and amazing, however quality of the food is slightly lacking, neither good nor bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cHRIcHlBRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Thick cuts of Sashimi, albeit fresh! Beef carpaccio is highly recommended👍🏻 Seems like their specialty is Iberico. Tried the Aburi mentaiko, interesting taste. Grilled Hokke(not in pic) was perfectly grilled with subtle fragrant😌

Overall it's a cosy place for chill over drinks & food. Enjoyed!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5d083U0J3EAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Quality food, nice and tasty. Will come back for more! Prefer the Premium Buta Don to Buta Don as the meat is more tender. Sashimi is fresh but typical."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eHFQLXhnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Had the three-kinds butadon and all three kinds of pork were amazing! Different textures and flavours and all of them were great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeDRpOGdnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),4,"Amazing buta don dishes served here! Recommend the pork belly and the aburi buta dishes. The unagi jyu is also a must have if you like unagi - melt in your mouth and very flavourful. Can get the mix sets for the best of both worlds - there are seasonal options and a wide variety of things other than unagi and pork, like sashimi, squid, chicken etc.

Decently priced, good location, spacious and many seats. Service can be a bit slow but otherwise satisfactory."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cU9uckNREAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Had their 3-Kind Buta Combo Jyu. It was rice (don) with grilled chestnut pork belly, pork loik, and Iberico pork jowl. All of them tasted great with the help of the chilli powder. The waiting time was okay. A bit expensive, but would say it’s worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cjVLVlRREAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Their chicken nanban don (fried chicken with tartar sauce) was delicious.. Service was quick and fuss free as well on a Sat lunch
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd2NfT2pRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Not bad in term of taste and quality, but a bit pricey. Total cost is $80.15 for these 4 items plus an onsen egg."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3JteFd3EAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Very satisfied with the seasonal meatless menu!! Generous portion! Delish!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMWRPV1BBEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Marinated soft egg really good. Other than that, nothing else worth mentioning. Ramen broth incredibly salty. Salmon just sauce with rice, nothing special."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2akppdHhRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Tried unagi and pork jowl combo don, unagi was a tad fishy, while pork jowl was great with good combination of fats n meat. Overall pretty tasty but the sauce can be overpowering towards the end."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDejhpazhBRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Expected price for good quality pork and beef don but still on the pricier side. Quick and efficient service, friendly staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdnJEMjZRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Ordered the Premium Butadon and it was flavourful, the ratio of fat to meat is great and it literally melts in the mouth. I would definitely come back to try the other butadon and ramen."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4bmEtcnBBRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,"Not bad but still has a lot of room for improvement,  e.g. to provide honest n decent portion , felt cheated only 1 clam in soup , octopus karrage was too hard and such a small portion for the price.not sure it was top grade as its kinda covered with too much marinate"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzlmeXlRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Simple-looked japanese restaurant & offers a variety of high quality donburi (rice bowls) at affordable prices in a comfortable and affable ambience. Their flamed seared grilled meats was a great highlight n premium quality used but we take a step back n try their other dishes. Wow... Equally good n oishi. The garlic edamame once eaten, I can say u practically can just go along with their liquor n chit chat with friends. It's not too garlicky n u won't have the ""green"" taste of peas. Next up is the chicken nanban don, avocado salad n saba shioyaki, brings out the perfection in each dish, balancing each component’s texture and coordinating their flavors so that all come together to create the awesome taste, tantalizing your taste buds...."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMm9iODNRRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Delicious, affordable.

Had the basic buta don (set thanks to the lunch promo), base price was $11 before tax.

Verdict? Really good. The pork was nice and tender and the seasoning makes you hungrier. Rice was packed nicely and fills you up well.

Eating companion took chicken nanban ($11) and it was good as well. The tartar sauce and karrage seasoning went well together.

Will be back to try the other stuff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb3NPYzFnRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,Best food in town good service recommended buta don😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbFBUZFdnEAE,Aburi-EN (Jem),3,The portion size of the ebi salmon ikura don is paltry.  The staff also served us the wrong food items - ebi salmon don without ikura and salmon mentaiko don - and I had to highlight this to the staff. The wagyu stamina don I ordered on a previous occasion was also mediocre and had too much vegetables. What a pity…
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1X2ZDbW9BRRAB,Aburi-EN (Jem),5,"Love the buta don! Affordable and delicious. Wagyu don is not worth the price, beef was not tender."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcTZIbW9nRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,3,The food quality can be better as compared to their competitor as some of the food items are really salty and portion are small/thin. The fried fish skin is not really appetizing as really tough when biting it...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0szeGRREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,"Fast, clean. Slightly advantage in the varieties,  so can order what your personal  that you like. Quality is  higher and among the best

Fast sushi but good place to have decent peaceful catch-up meals without rushing in a busy shopping centre environment.  This one sitted side by side (abit more diff but will do)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeVBiRXB3RRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,3,Service is good but shoyu taste not really used to theirs. Salmon sashimi not fresh enough. Might consider to return but at the moment got better options nearby.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaGZXRm5RRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"if I had given a review months ago when they first opened I would probably have given 4  stars . I actually thought they were ok , pretty decent , other then salmon skin which arrived cold and rather oily . Average reviews were over 4 stars then .

Visited yesterday and was stunned by the drastic drop in standards.
The salmon sashimi was literally pink like it's dried for a while .  My company thought it was weird for me to recommend genki since he boycotted for a while due to low standards.  And after seeing the salmon I just couldn't bring myself to send in the rest of the orders.

They also got our orders wrong.
It wasn't busy yet it happened.  So I have no idea what's happening in the kitchen .
When we received the tuna roll they actually felt warm to the mouth.  This is an air conditioned restaurant and something with raw fish felt warmer than room temperature.

Unless things change I doubt I'll be adventurous enough to risk another experience here ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdExHdGZ3EAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,The service here is good and that there were a lot of seats available when I come to have my dinner. The food taste amazing and that it is delivered very quickly through the use of the train set they have. The ordering of food is done through scanning a QR code and ordering at the website. The food is prepared quickly and I had an very good time here.  Would recommend for the residents of Boon Lay to visit and try out their food. Through the food might be expensive for some people though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcEwzaVNnEAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,3,"Some of the menu rly tasted different from other outlets. They also missed our order and after telling them, they only delivered 2/4 missing orders. Had to let them know again.

Other than that, everything normal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdzZqTVdBEAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"One star is for the train service. Lol. Salmon sashimi itself is like frozen thawed food, not fresh. California Roll like had a train wrecked upon arriving. Chicken Nanban had so much dough on it, the worst among other japanese restaurants in Jurong Point. Fried squid tentacles, i dont mind it was double fried but when served it is not even hot on the inside..omg."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOHVmaWxnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,"service super average, food is also typical. do note many prices have inflated, and there’s no more free mentai sauce! go to remain the genki roll and mentaiko trio salmon, cant go wrong"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMm9pZU53EAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,Mentai Mayo Fries deserved a zero star. Do not order this unless you top up at least 2 pack more of Mentai. Almost like regular French Fries.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcFpPM0R3EAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,"Used to work for Genki sushi more than 10 years ago when I was still a student, even as customer, I often patronise them as the food was great back then. Recently went down to this outlet to redeem my birthday voucher only to then know about their app maintenance. Staff said they cannot use the voucher without the app and told me to email Genki Sushi to extend the voucher deadline. Thankfully, Genki Sushi understood my circumstances and agreed to extend my voucher deadline so that I may still enjoy a birthday discount. Will continue to patronise Genki Sushi with good extending customer service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMmQyS2xnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"Order came wrongly and it took more than 20 mins for my first place of sashimi to come.

The outlet still has tons of empty seats which obviously show that it's not busy at all. Things were pretty much self service. My orders only came after I informed the staff that my orders have not arrive yet.

This outlet at Jurong point have way lesser people compared to other outlets even though it's a weekend. I can see the reason now."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyX3VMbzlnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,Food was felt substandard compared to other branches. Less crowded than other branches but staff service was bad. Wanted to use a M mall voucher and explicitly mentioned before paying at cashier but the staff said “next time must say before using” and refused to redo the transaction even though we had not paid and had mentioned clearly before she keyed in anything.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejVhM2FREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,Honestly not bad if you're just coming for sushi and some other things if you aren't super hungry. It's obviously pricey compared to other foods but it's sushi and the quality of fish was okay. Salmon and salmon belly were the best quality out of what they had. Much better than sushi-go Jurong Point if you're coming for sushi. However the cooked foods here at genki was pretty lame and sushi go is probably better for that.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM0txOW1RRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,Nice clean place for my sushi cravings. Order food by scanning the QR code and it's fun having to see your food arrive by the conveyer train. Prices are affordable and lots of options on their menu.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bE9yRkpREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,3,You get u paid for. Skip the Chu Toro. It will ruined u for life.

Came ordered from app
Water sold out. Ask waitress for water that say reply there’s no water here. So I have to req ice a drink water from hot tap…
Order a can of coke. From the start after I finish my meal the coke just served
Sushi Rices was bad
Raw ingredients wasn’t fresh
Service was bad"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdDhiWFBREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,3,Food is ok abeit small in portion.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycmJlRndRRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,"Relatively new branch.
The food and service here better than Westgate. Enjoyed the salmon belly and unagi DMZ. The gyu don was authentic too, only missing onsen egg. Chicken teriyaki rice was also good! Husband enjoys the soba and he's usually quite picky with his food.

However, chicken namban was much smaller than sushi-go. Fish soup has alot of bones. Fried prawn and tempura are not as great. Coroquet was good.

Besides green tea, there's a variety of soft drinks and root beer! Generally good experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPODZPcGt3RRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,"Food tastes great and the sushi is fresh. I have been to some Genki stores in Singapore where the sushi isn't fresh or cut well.
Genki sushi can be quite expensive though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3U3ZVd3EAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,Service and food quality getting worse each time I patronised. Majority of the food super salty. Chef knife skills damn good can slice the sashimi until like paper thin.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTdyRkpBEAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,4,Great sushi for all times
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHN2VmpnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,Very good quality sushi for affordable prices.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd0pMNlJ3EAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,"Had a superb dinning experience at genki sushi jurong point on 9/4/22 at 6pm. We are seated at table 41. Special and worthy mentioning of two staff namely supervisor Sean and one of the staff named janeth who warm our hearts. Sean cordially asked whether my 5yr old girl need any children cutlery without me even asking. Next my elder girl dropped the softshell handroll on the booth seat as she took from the assembly train. Janeth was so attentive and promptly informed Sean. Straightaway, Supervisor Sean offered to replace a new dish which we don't expect to as it was purely our own fault. Sean even personally check on us whether the dish had been served to my girl. We are so pleased with such top-notch service rendered to us.  Really thumbs up to janeth and Sean. They are genki valuable superstars. Sincerely hope Genki recognised Janeth and Sean for such fabulous service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGJ1MDdnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"The food was average, Orchard central will be a better choice.
The staffs keep wanting to clear our plates when we were still eating… they will take and throw the cutlery into their trolley. Overall a very bad experience… I won’t recommend this outlet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyel9fV3VnRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"On 28/5/22,i bought my parents to try genki at jurong point for the first time,i had good experience from other outlets and thought i would have the same here too but to my disappointment, it was a let down on the services,lady at the table infront of us was getting up to get her food (okonomiyaki stick) from the train which was situated at the third level, when she was taking it off,the train begins to go back, she did not manage to catch the plate and the food flew off to our table and landed onto my mum's dress.The mayo and sauce smeared all over my mum dress and they did came immediately to ask what happen ,then proceeds to just clean up.While it is not anyones fault,we thought that we could have at least gotten a sorry that this happen as my mum was visibly upset.

Even though they were swift to clean up,it was not cleaned,the bonito flakes were still on the sofa and some sauce residue, thus we left that seat empty and switch sides.The manager just explain that the kitchen will allow the train to go back when the food is unattended for a period of time.Overall not a very pleasant experience,we quickly ate and left,hope that it shall never happen to anyone as there wont be any sort of compensation or even a single apology,have to deal with it urself okay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bTl5bnlRRRAB,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,5,One of the outlets that has lots of tables for groups of 5 and above. Not like Vivocity where they only have 1 table for groups of 5 and above.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdklQZ2RREAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,The worst genki outlet! Went to collect my takeaway orders and 3 staffs walk passed telling me to wait and I waited 10mins when for nothing as my orders are already ready on the table. Finally a waitress attend to me but she was impatient and rude! Didnt apologize and even brushed me off rudely! Supervisor was at the cashier and he saw what happened but he ignored. No wonder the rest of the staffs had poor attitude! Paid for such service really not worth it! Will never step in this outlet again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMk1QZExnEAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"Ordered hanjuku egg. As first , I rejected as it looked like a cooked egg. Then they served again as picture .. is this hanjuku eggs? complaining only for their hanjuku egg . Funny hanjuku egg"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX0tIVE9nEAE,Genki Sushi Jurong Point,1,"Got a queue number an hour and a half before.
Message notification was in accurate (it’s still okay acceptable maybe malfunction)

Upon returning to check for our queue status had already exited 2 queue number. Confronted the genki  staff Shirley. she lied in an uncouth manner saying that queue not in sequence.

However checking with another Chinese staff she claim that queue number should be in sequence since day 1 working in this outlet.

This is nonsense customer service provided by Shirley. Utterly speechless by such uncouth manner.

Hopefully genki would take this feedback into consideration. To improve on customer service relation instead of lying with eye wide open to your customer

Thank you"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdzdqeDZRRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"B2 of Westgate outside Hao Mart.

Have to order ahead before seating.

Tables are cleaned with cleanser after each patron as I've seen it done.

4 stars cause they're Japanese grill but the options are limited and has kimchi on their don. Kimchi is a nice touch though.

Meat are grilled nice, not too oily which pairs well with the rice. If you're going to have this as first meal or is a big eater, you should order more.

Had pork belly and chicken thigh which were nice. Someone mentioned looks homemade in their review and I tend to agree but isn't homemade nicer and more flexible in the ingredients?

I would be there again to try others."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMmV6VGxBRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,"Delicious don with smell of barbecue. The sliced  pork has little bits of bone, so needs to be careful for small children. Online ordering is not recommended as it only accepts PayPal. Perhaps they could upgrade to accept other modes of payment for online ordering. So it’s best to order from the counter. They accept PayNow, NETS and cash at the counter."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdzZYVFB3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"Good food at great prices, the chicken thigh don is really nice - especially the leek. The gyudon is decent enough, but kind of tough. Their more premium beef options fare better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ2VQdmpnRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"We tried a few of their dons including the pork belly, beef striploin, beef steak, Saba fish and a few of their skewers. Would highly recommend their skewers and the pork bowl and give the beef a miss as it was too overcooked and difficult to chew."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXB1TkZREAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,Food took a while to come. Portion was quite small but food was tasty. Ordering using qr code was quite confusing. Set meal option wasn't elaborated in the website
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPemMyWktnEAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"No frills Japanese dons and grilled sticks at reasonable prices. Serving can take some time. The dons were tasty and well seasoned, but it feels a bit like Chinese cooking on Japanese ingredients. Mushrooms were well grilled, gyoza was not as crispy as expected, mackarel fish rice was a reliable bowl."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXZMUGV3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,1,"1. There is hidden cost of service charge unless you pay with PayPal.

2. Ordered the yakibuta don and they served me a raw egg (totally regretted for not taking photo of it) - would have let the matter go instead of posting on social media if not for the unprofessional response from the staff - ""our egg is like that one"" after I pointed that the onsen egg was totally raw as the egg white was transparent.

3. Another staff changed the egg, came back still translucent (yes, a slight improvement I would say) - this time I took photos as attached. I'm sure anyone has a better understanding of onsen egg.

4. You might seriously want to consider another Japanese stall.. They use normal rice (not Japanese rice) and the rice was lumped together (see photo)."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLS1lOHFRRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,"Kimchi grilled pork rice bowl was not very worth it, pork slices were tender and grilled super well with that nice char but quite few. The kimchi was also such a meagre pathetic portion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cmNmcXJRRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,"Very satisfying meal for both me and my wife - the taste exceeds our expectations and the portion is generous. Will certainly return for more, especially to try the other items on the menu. 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azZmZTNRRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,They serve good food at affordable price and their yakitori is yummy too. Though the stall is small but at least there's standard in their food.  Went there for few times and will recommend it.

Must say i am slightly disappointed, wasn't as good as i had anticipated. I mean it is decent and is affordable. Ordered the #BeefSteakDon (SGD$10.90) and #KimchiSlicedBeefDon (SGD$6.90), both include a glass of tea. In my opinion, the kimchi slice beef don is more worth it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpeUpuSnFnRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,Chicken skewer and grilled vegetables are packed with flavours while the beef is a bit hard / dry. All has a light charcoal flavour (which I like). You may want to order side dish as the portion is a bit small. No complaint here given a really affordable price tag.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNGZUY1V3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,"Great value for the amazing food they serve. The portions are big (there were two rows of pork in my pork belly don!) and they taste really good. Definitely a place for a nice grill meat meal.

The pork belly don and salmon don comes with kimchi and half a soft boiled egg, while the steak don comes with an onsen egg."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNjY3VWVBEAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,Great experience. Small Japanese Eatery serving generous amount of meat. Pork belly is juicy and sauce goes well with the rice. Will come back again soon!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMEtYR2lRRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,"Ordered the jumbo pork belly don $10.80. Hmm, not fantastic in terms of taste because all I taste is lightly marinated and lightly grilled pork belly. Maybe it's just me, idk.

I wouldn't say it's very authentic, a bit disappointed to say the least. On the bright side, the portion is quite huge, maybe that's the selling point.

Would still recommend, do give it a try, maybe you will appreciate it more than me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHJqbjNBRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,2,Rice is cold and a bit hard to chew. Beef is cold also
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM3RpODZ3RRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,Food court Japanese yakitori don eatery. Simple food (while  a tad lacking in authenticity) but  reckon its good enuf and suffice for a quick meal. I had the Japanese premium beef rice bowl. The beef was a tad overdone but still OK. Could have added a bit sauce while grilling as the whole rice bowl is slightly on the dry side.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dGE3MmN3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"This place is not so much about service. A small shop located at the basement of Westegate. Ordered the Yakibuta don. I have to say, i don't really know what that was so I ordered it. It turns out to be more chewy than I like but tasty enough. The egg is done quite alright. Presentation was almost there. Maybe dont cover my runny egg with the weed? Look like like this egg needs a hair cut. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Maybe try something else if it is your first time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjlpSFV3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,Don’t want to splurge but looking for a decent Japanese meal?

Meats were grilled perfectly with a hint of charcoal taste. Crispy and very lightly burnt. Poached eggs were perfect, too. Prices were very reasonable and portions considered generous. Unless you are a big eater. The only downside was the waiting time. Please expect 15 minutes or more as food is prepared freshly. We were there without a queue and had to wait 15 minutes. If you are in a rush or with low patience, this is not for you."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdzk3QXZ3RRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,Set meal was not worth it. Beef steak was too dry. Egg too salty. Grilled oyster mushroom too oily. Chicken thigh ok.

I do not like the kimchi that is served with the don as it's supposed to be Japanese food - not a fan of something sour, even if its purpose is to be an appetiser.

Would not recommend the sliced beef don as it is too salty."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMzQzdFh3EAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,"Super awesome meal I had that other day on the 22nd of June. Was serve by a young lady. Rice bowls are awesome, tried one stick of grill initially, but it was way too good. Tea was free flow, like most Singaporean free thing must take. in conclusion, food 10/10 waiting time 9/10(Not so busy day afterall), customer service, 9/10. Will definitely visit again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MXB2eldBEAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,"If you want to have something cheap and yummy, please give this store a try. Here for the 6th time and the food standard keeps improving. Although they may be quite slow with their service, it’s honestly worth the wait.

Just hope the management can look into the lack of manpower here. I always see 1 staff rushing to grill the meat, do the cashiering, clear the tables, pour the drinks for the customers...... Hope their pay is worth the amount of stress they have been through."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NGRDeG93RRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,4,"Pretty good grilled meat rice bowl. The egg was very well prepared, the yolk soft but not runny. The grilled meat was well grilled and seasoned.

Would definitely eat again.

The $4 add on for a vegetable skewer and a cup of roasted barley tea is a bit too pricy in my opinion. Mainly because both those add ons were pretty small. But if that's what it takes to keep the stall afloat, I guess I'll keep supporting."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwOTRWRBAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,3,"Tried a premium steak set lunch, their chicken skewer, and the grilled squid. Impression for each dish is:
-Premium steak set lunch was a good amount of food for the price but the beef was on the tougher side. I wouldn't recommend this particular set to others.
-Chicken skewer was fantastic. It was juicy and had a ton of flavour. Pretty cheap too.
-Squid was fine. Nothing particularly exceptional either way.

I likely won't be back due to the number of alternative options to try, but if I did go back, I'd just order a bunch of chicken skewers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNHZiZjFBRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,Ordered the premium steak don and pork slices don. The meat portion is surprisingly sizeable for the price and seasoning is really good. Very value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcTVteVJREAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,1,"Ordered the premium steam don, beef was super dry and rare, making it tough to chew. Miso soup tasted like those instant packet soup, and the grilled vegetable was probably the most decent thing there. First and last time, not recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2M3Q2dDFnRRAB,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,1,"Disgusting food, everything is overcooked and overpriced, how can everything still taste bland with all the garnishes and ingredients.

Upsized/Jumbo set is just double portion of rice. lol!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycU9MalFBEAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,nice and delicious food. highly recommended！good customer service！
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpZ2F2QktREAE,Kushiya Japanese Grill House,5,The BBQ beef or pork are very delicious. Never miss a chance to try their meals. You will not regret for sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeE5INzBnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,Today ate dinner at about 1840.staff did not put any sauce initially ..I asked to put ..so little..then my wife ask to add.they told her got sauce already why need to add ?sigh..so poor service.then they add..you can see from picture its a miserable amount.conpared to before it's like super budget.then I ask 3rd time but they want to charge me 80 cents.think the service level is really poor and why suddenly so stingy over sauce ???
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjRlSXdnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Good portion for kids. We come to the Japanese dining hall very often, each of them is delicious!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPanVEcXVnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,"Excellent yakitori, the food is straightforward such as pork belly, chicken, chicken cheese balls on sticks but unlike most stalls selling such food it is dipped in sticky BBQ sauce. Good value, basically the same as Old Chang Kee but I find Wadori is better. Does value meals or you can just order whatever you like."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MGMyWGJ3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,"I would like to complain about how bad of a service the cashier is, rudely asking for orders and it was my first time ordering and not only that the person uses the same gloves to take food and cash and I find it very unsanitary. I hope this can change, I really love the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbnEyQ09BEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Nice japanese food street having lot variety of food, ample space to seat dining in.
Suitable for family and friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXczR6OHRRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,"Great  1st time there. Food quality is good, plenty of sitting, orders can be made via QR code of ordering machine located in store. However price a little high. Almost comparison with the Japanese restaurants. Thought it should be slightly cheaper considering it being food court concept. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant lunch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNReUptQ2lnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,A nice japanese food street with stalls and also various japanese restaurants.  Good options if u like japanese stuff. sushi ramen yaktori etc.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd0tMNGNBEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,Always buy but quite ex. Even add more sauce ask for 80c. Haha
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMjYtUjVRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,This is newly opened in Jurong Point basement with many japanese food stores. I have tried the fried rice with char siew and ramen with char siew. Both dishes are taste good and especially the ramen soup is very thick as serving from restaurant quality.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3aEpIUERnEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,Tasty but not the place to go to if you're looking for grilled
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3bXZTQVJ3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"The Japanese food street concept is really great where you can enjoy quality Japanese food in a food court style as well as pick a restaurant of your preference to find more in elegance. The good is not all authentic, but the standard is close enough to the genuine ones in Orchard. The price points are around SGD10 for a set meal for an individual."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNN2NEa2VnEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,"Not bad, but the menu of ordering machine a bit complicated, not so easy to handle especially for those elderly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbjYzSDNnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,"Not my 1st unhappy experience..... I dun blame the staff coz I got the same answer thrice. Among so many Japanese bento brand, tis is the only one very stingy with sauce.

At Wadori, each time I asked for more sauce, staff sure say ""it's gonna be very salty ya"". The initial driżżle of sauce is so insignificant, how salty can it be? (I'm not exaggerating, it's really miserable)

Then they will highlight ""additional sauce will cost additional 70cents"".
70cents for another miserable drizzle of sauce?

I hope u can improve on tis, dun make ur staff say the same sentences again, do something abt the sauce. If not, u can consider giving way to other brands.

p.s. tdy's rice is mushy, not the usual Japanese rice standard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMW9qd2R3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Nice place for a quick snack but also pairs great with the Ramen shop opposite it! They have an agreement where they lease part of the shop's seating to the Ramen store so you can enjoy the best of both worlds! The sweet teriyaki sauce complements the salty Ramen very well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dWFDMTZRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,Service sucks given by a guy I say more than 3 times combo A keep asking if ur staff having a bad day don't vent it to the customer showing one type of face
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bllTa1N3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,There were many options available. My personal favourite was the bbq.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbEtfYVVBEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,"The newly revamped Japanese food hall has many new and enjoyable choices, from Ramen to Gohan. The Saba Shioyaki Set ($11.90) and Beef Rice Set ($14.90) from My Gohan were both good and the furnishings were refreshing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydU9iNXJRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Reasonable price for food here.. great experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ekxhLXpBRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),2,"poor service , auntie seemed reluctant to serve and showed black face"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNDVpcmt3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,Enjoy my lunch here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXFHLTJ3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"1st visit to Go Sushi at JP.. Sushi taste OK but the sushi not packed firmly, easily disintegrate when picking up with chopstick.. Unique way to serve food fast and fuss-free via shin train.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeXJLc3BBRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Like the jab foodcourt style and the food is good :)

Student price at $5.90 is affordable too for students. Else is slightly costly for a meal with no veg"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHFlT3lRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,"One of the best, pssss Google asked for second review?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeklUdUt3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Nice food but watch out, sometimes the fried chicken a bit raw inside."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a05fRF9RRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,Have not visited this restaurant after my last visit
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOEwzNG5nRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,"Went to pack at Yakitori, Didn’t notice my tamagoyaki is missing a few cube from the stick until I reached home. Feeling sad right now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbDhPa1pnEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Great food at affordable prices. Requires qr code scanner to view menu for most places
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLM05lOGJBEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,"Terrible staff at Wadori, either not focusing and letting others cut my queue, or not telling me something from my set has run out. Gave 2 chances, both failed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOXVlZzF3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,"Only tried the yakitori stall, ok food

Will try other stalls in future

Overall, nothing much changed for ambience, except the name and maybe, owners?

More additions for other shops along the street ba..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdzQtWUF3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Restaurant quality Japanese food at food court prices. Great value for money. Great quality of food. You can take the quality of the ingredients.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaXMtREN3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,Amazing food selection with the upgraded choice of japanese canned drinks
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcGYtSDFBRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,"So so only. I was expecting bigger portion and better taste, turn out just okok only."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNLVpxOEpBEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Although limited variety but it serves its purpose as a Japanese Food court.
What I like best is you can just scan the QR code on each table to access to each stall to order.
You only need to leave the table when food is ready.👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMHBUeGN3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,I took away a set from My Gohan @ Jurong Point Mall today. Only when I arrived home I realized that not all dishes we ordered and paid were given to us. Be careful and check your order if you want to buy food from here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdmZEUldREAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,My go-to place to satisfy all my cravings for Japanese cuisine! I like how I could conveniently make my order by scanning the QR code printed on the table also there's also free Wi-Fi provided.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdE1tRWl3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Delicious food and there is free wifi. Has a variety of food. Highly recommended to eat here.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJLWV5ZENREAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),2,"Not as good as I thought.  Hate the pasta !  Took two mouth and I gave up. Very oily for tomatoes pasta !

Ramen, sushi and sashimi were good. Forget about hokkaido buffet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRaGJMVFdnEAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,The rice is too hard and sticky! Not sure if it's overcook or undercook! Paid near $20 dollars get disastrous food. Please take note of the QC~
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwb0lQaXhBRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,"Apart from the sincerity of a few service staff like Catherine, there’s nothing to laude about this place. Had a terrible dining experience at the place today. Stall - Wadori kept getting my order wrong and I had to wait 30 min for raw pork with asparagus. Had to keep getting up to get orders from multiple stall and lunch was cleared while getting another order when I’m not done with it. Apart from Catherine who was helpful in rectifying the situation, the others merely stood by. Food quality is really so-so, coupled with this kind of service - there’s really no joy dining here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNTRfZjh3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,It is a very characteristic street. A lot of stores. And some good restaurants. There are also some ninjas sneaking on your heads. And it is always crowded.
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJbDVSYhAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,Meat is good but rice was overcooked. I always order the bird eggs to mix with pork meat Bcos it's sooooo good hehe
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeXVPMjhnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"really a good place to chill ... feels like being in Japan
the food is excellent and fresh
MUST TRY"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPXzlxbnNBRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Nice place with nice Japanese foods
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaWNxVTVnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Reasonably priced bentos
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNjlXWndnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,Dropped my egg on the tray. Didn’t apologise and PUT IT BACK INTO MY BOWL OF RICE.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTZqY0l3EAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),5,Food nice
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNHE3UjJnRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),3,Japanese food court concept. Fuss free japanese food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDX1k2aVRREAE,Wadori (Jurong Point),1,It's so salty that I need to clean away the sauce before eating. I even ordered an extra sauce..... haizzzz
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwb3FlUjlRRRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"All sorts of Japanese food in one area! The Sushi Go train is fun! Have your sushi delivered via a mini train rather than on the usual conveyer belt. There's also ramen, yakitori, bakery, dessert, just to name a few. Bring your $ and empty tummy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNX2ZqRmp3RRAB,Wadori (Jurong Point),4,"Tomato ramen is a must try.
Personally think the Tonkatsu ramen is good. No need travel to get your ramen fix.
Prefer the shio one as I like ramen salty.

The pizza shop is also good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ3EyY3FRRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,Nice place. Set menu are worth it. Meat quality is top notch! Smoke free BBQ. Won’t let you leave smelling like a bbq grill. Meat is juicy and tender after grilling. Top with rice and let the fats drip into the rice. Set comes with choice of salad or kimchi. Drinks are not included. Soup is included in set. Economical pricing. Choose from basic set menu or premium set menu for better quality meat. No bookings. Walk in only and expect queue during peak hours. Definitely 1 of my favourites now!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaWNlMG5nRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,"Great concept of bringing affordable yakiniku to the masses. Menu can come across as beef heavy although lamb, chicken, and seafood options are available. Wagyu is available. Ingredients are fresh but portion is small. Grilling is diy and smoke control is pretty good. Service crews were attentive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaExyNkNnEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,"Nice and fresh meat. Great beef, Good cut and well marinated. Good BBQ system with no smoke and no smell. Great portion also for that price. The mushrooms also very nice. price is slightly at the high side S$17 per person. Very clean restaurant. If group dine in, they won't allow incomplete group to enter into all has arrived. Clean restaurant. Was half full during a weekday evening 6pm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM003dV9RRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,"Food is quite good but service and ordering system can be improved. Service staff spilled raw food residue on the order receipt, no apologies. Ordering System faulty, have informed service staff and shown staff the error on the screen. Troubled him to check on order but he misinterpreted us. Later, double portion food was served and we quickly informed service staff but was faced with dispute, he called manager and said we ordered wrongly in our face. There was no apologies from either the manager or the staff, and it seems that we are the ones at fault. The food was untouched and they brought it back to the kitchen.  When we ordered food the third time through the system. Still faulty (no stock for 1 item, but the other have stock). Food never came this time. We didn’t bother about it as whole dining experiences was ruined."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbVA2c0JREAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,"Over hype is what I think after the meal
I had always seen long Q at PLQ, etc...
So during an off peak time, when I walk pass this branch at JP, I walked it. Ordered the set meal. short rib beef.
If you are not too hungry, this set meal will suit you. Everything front he meat portion (100g), rice, side dish is small. Note, meat shrinks when grilled.
Generally, you get a simple Japanese meal without smelling badly like BBQ after the visit.
Note, the condiment, garlic chili hits a different note..rather spicy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaVl2NGl3RRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,"Very decent Japanese BBQ chain!

As it’s name suggests, they do have a dine-in limit of 50 minutes per table, which actually is more than sufficient, given that the meals here are individually prepared, and are cooked within minutes.

Prices are rather affordable, but could add up really fast once you start ordering the ala carte dishes (100g of chicken at $3.90, super worth it!)

Will definitely return, given the quality and price! 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX0xpQV9RRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,"Chicken, karubi are nice. First try on tongue, it's okay. Got more varieties compared to other yakiniku competitors. This is under ichiban sushi group."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNlBPLTNnRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,Decided to try Yakiniku-Go after trying their another competitor (hey yakiniku). The experience is quite similar except that it's slightly more pricier and the quality & taste of their meats are not as good. Overall an average experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeC1uekdREAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,Ordered the Signature Yakiniku-GO Set full steak with 3 types of cuts and Wagyu beef set.  The only complaint is they limit to 50 minutes for the dining-in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdXRHdlRREAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,Located at B1 near the end of the Japanese Street food section. Waiting time not too bad if before or after the peak hours. Just wish they had free flow cold green tea
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eVlIa3lnRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,Flameless technology and its smokeless! Rest assured that you won’t smelt badly for a meal of bbq. Meat cut is good!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd05xbk9REAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,1,"Today is 3rd May, 2022. We have tried this restaurant many times since we live in the condo upstairs Jurong Point. the food is ok, but the staff's attitude is not acceptable.
We were standing at the queuing line, a Staff called Catherine, walking towards us without saying anything and didn't even look at us. She stand at the welcoming counter and doing something at the counter, just half a meter away from us, very close, trying to ignore our ""hi"", ""hello"" and many louder sentences because we wanted to get her attention, we even waved our hands a lot.
We could not believe this bad behavior from a staff of such a well-known restaurant.
We would like to highlight the female staff- Catherine to be trained properly, otherwise we will escalate to the management or will never return to this restaurant again!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbEp6RzdBRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,1,"Very bad dining experience, the middle age waitress has an unbelievably bad attitude, the set menu omits soup, and no plate was given, there is even a handprint with sauce on the rice bowl, very disgusting!  Some of the meat is cut into very small pieces even leaked out of the grid and burned the grid to black, when we asked to change the grid the waitress was very impatient and directly told us meal time out and we should go, OMG we had just been seated for less than 40 minutes,  Half of the order didn’t finish and she wanted to kick us out just because we asked her to change the grid! So ridiculous! How did someone with such an attitude become a waiter? Will never go back to this restaurant again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dE95VGpRRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,"The beef is not very good quality, the taw karubi is like pink color and taste like pork, comes in many small crumbs and pieces, the sauce also cannot choose your own, price is a bit high as well, however the mini salad tastes better than competitor’s. Overall it is not tasty and the meat quality is not up to expectations, I’d rather go to the other brand in Clementi mall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLLW82SnRBRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,"Very affordable yakiniku! Service is good and they have a mobile queuing system so you don't have to wait in line.

Downside is there's some cold spots on the electric grill."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bmZTcUF3EAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,1,"A few plates of meat for 2 pax, $90 and not even filling. Honestly just go for some random bbq buffet also more worth it"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdFptcTFBRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,enjoyed every single bit of it. it has been a few days yet i’m still drooling over the photos we took lmao
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcXYycUxBEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,2,"Horrible service as there's no courtesy practice in this restaurant. They treated customer like a flog of hungry animals and reminded us that we are only given 50mins to finish up everything.

Especially a server named, Catherine, super rude!1

Not recommended for big group especially you have to seat few tables apart."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcS1QcTN3RRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,3,Quick meat you can grill yourself with 2 sauces
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHclotNDVnRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,MUST TRY! Have been visiting their outlets a couple of times since my first visit. Affordable selection of meats which might I add weren’t of bad quality. Pretty consistent as well! Would recommend the Karubi for a affordable and enjoyable meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmZ1Ym9nRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,"The meat was marinated perfectly with the sauce and easily to be cooked.
I do not like to eat beef but their beef is tender and tasted nicely with the lime sauce.
Worth a try and definitely will come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNGFmQmF3EAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,"It opened.
Nice queueing system.
Food were great for the price.
50 min Time limit dining."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dXBHWkVBEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,Best value set meal
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMzRuMVBBEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,Tried the A5 Wagyu n double karubi. I prefer the karubi set for its value. Jyo karubi especially
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMTdlR0VnEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,2,"A replicate version of another popular yakiniku in Singapore. The service is great, prompt and friendly enough.

However comparing the price, this is slightly cheaper than its competitor. The main difference is the quality of the meat, seems subpar and lack of taste (more rubbery and bland) the other components such a salad and condiments is a no go.

For its price at affordable level but could be better, if you’re gonna queue 2-3 hours for this then don’t bother."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMm9Id0lBEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,2,"Love it here, came more than 10x. However today, this staff called Catherine has a really horrible attitude & was too lazy to redeem our points for us. Anyway, hating on her, not the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2ci11Nlp3EAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,didnt take much photos. but it was really value for the quality of meat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd01xMER3EAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,1,Staff totally and intentionally ignored customers despite us keeping saying hello to get her attention to get seats. Staff name is Catherine.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeGJxNnRRRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,Have ordered their Karubi Set upsized. Meat was good. won’t have the bbq stained smell after eating. also good place for solo people. Price :$$
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb2F2M253RRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,2,Lousy service as in i order a set and there is no rice... have to talk to 2 staffs then the rice came. Order wagyu not bad but the meat is too thin slice.... not really worth to go.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWVueFNnEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,4,Good service! Price is slightly higher as compared to other Yakiniku Restaurant but still affordable and worth it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxXzl1a1VBEAE,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,5,"When it first open at seletar mall, I was hoping it will open on JP. After one year, they finally did. Love the food there. Staff Are friendly too on my 3 visits..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Zy1PTThnRRAB,Yakiniku-GO @ Jurong Point,1,Very bad service experience. Why should we eat at a place and feeling annoyed but the unpleasant staffs.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc2VpRC1BRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Had dinner there with family.
My 1st attempt on Japanese food. The taste was not bad at all. My other family members seemed to enjoy the food there.
The food served was fast.
The staffs were friendly. We were initiated to transfer to a more cosy corner for our family feast.
Indeed felt like in a Japanese restaurant atmosphere there due to the interior deco."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcll2VnJnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"Tried their Smoked Duck Ramen & Garlic Ramen, and I took the Garlic Ramen. For someone who prefers a stronger taste, this garlic is on the lite spectrum.

Overall, the soup base is still tasty. One thing to note is that the service crew here is friendly and provide prompt service. This is also a halal restaurant that’s suitable for our Muslim community."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOC11S2JnEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"First and last time to be here! We order sashimi, beef ramen, chicken ramen, and abalone
The good thing was the salmon and eggs only, the rest was terrible! Cost me $60 incld tax and service charge. The soup was bland, overall not the taste i was hoping to be at-least-good enough. I rather go L2 to eat china beef noodle, than this one. Very disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHN1pHZ3dBRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,"@ichikokudosg LOOKS promising.

They have quite extensive menu and are halal certified therefore their broth are simmered with chicken bone instead. Here their ramen noodle is using hokkaido wheat flour which menu stated thin noodle for most of their ramen except the spicy version.

Moving on to what we have.
Ichikokudo Ramen Original. Is Shoyu Ramen which we feel it taste just plain SALTY 😆. I personally didn't like the egg as well. Doesn't have the molten centered yolk.

Tomato Ramen with Cheese, felt the broth is too thick and overwhelming upon first spoon. Like thickened tomato sauce / tomato puree with some fresh diced tomatoes while it does have that tanginess BUT couldn’t detect any cheese at all and everything just taste VERY SALTY and jelat. Unfortunately, we had to surrender the entire bowl.

Guess we just can't appreciate shoyu base ramen and chicken broth. 😝

Ig: @zoey_belle_"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a09XSW53RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"Well firstly, this is Halal Ramen broth for those who came here thinking it's pork  tonkotsu broth. So great to eat with Muslim friends!

Portion and price point wise is pretty okay. Its the flavours that feels abit off. The miso Ramen was really thick and salty. Abit hard to drink the soup it's more like a gravy. I rate: 2/5 🌟

Veggie Ramen had a huge portion of noodles and veggie so pretty full and light flavours. I rate: 3/5 🌟

Condiments really helped to give more flavours in the Ramen as per ur liking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybXVIYXBnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"store serves 2 types of Japanese staples,ramen and donburi.ramen Is based on  hokkaido style and there is a large variety to choose from.personal recommendation wld be their Donburi as it is quite filling and delicious.prices start from 12 dollars for a main and the set meal includes a fruit and either kaarage or gyzo.drinks are separate.all In all expect to pay abt 20 sgd++ per head."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd3Rxb1hBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"Probably a poor choice to come to a ramen place for salmon don

The salmon was fresh . Just a little weirded out by the warm rice that warmed my salmon . Everything was warm by the time it reached me . Warm raw fish isn't my thing .
Portions not the type to leave you satisfied . Felt like I was rationing myself during the meal . The fish looks so sparse on the rice like my hair on my head .
The gyoza, an offhand top up was probably the highlight of the meal .

If I ever returned,  it probably would be for ramen and not this , assuming I do . The only draw seems to be a place you bring friends if it needs to be halal .

Everything came to around $26 I feel I paid more for the deco than for my food
It's the kind of experience I'll say leaves you feeling shortchanged.
If I have to say it , 3 stars are entirely because of the deco and staff"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MDZUMEtBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Wasn’t crowded during the dinner period.
Decent ramen with generous portion.
The Karaage was too salty.. but quite tasty if you brush the sauce aside. Tomato cheese ramen is surprisingly pleasant. However, the beef ramen wasn’t that good and it had the very strong beefy smell 😅"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPemRtT3ZRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,My honest review was deleted. Went here to have dinner with my family. Last visit was bad. Returned after 1 year hoping that they imlroved. It was the weekend but totally empty. Shows that the bad quality remains. Food is super salty. Service is so-so. No service staff on the floor. All hiding inside.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2Fuc0xnEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Out of all the halal ramen, this so far is pretty close, especially the beef sukiyaki! Soy sauce flavour and decent amount of fat♡ the soup, noodles and toppings were good and the egg was marinated well in the soy, albeit the yolk was not runny. Still delicious nonetheless.

Their breakfast porridge was alright, tasted like a oyakodon porridge. Char siew beef ramen was alright, and their beef donburi was generous! And their matcha was really good!! Thick and full of matcha flavour and you can feel the powder. The ice cream was also great. Matcha pudding was very bitter by itself but paired with its brown sugar sauce was delicious. The only thing that was subpar that I ate was the salmon sashimi. But I'd definitely return for their ramen♡♡♡

The service was really friendly and quick and helpful! Atmosphere was really nice aswell."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNDhQSGhRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,Googled ramen shops and decided to go this ramen shop. I had Hokkaido butter ramen set. This set comes with Gyoza and Watermelon. Gyoza was not so nice but the ramen was enough to satisfy me.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOXZIQ2dBRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Great service, nice place for ramen and dons. Filling and tasty food enjoyed the smoked duck ramen and the dons, quite generous with the ingredients."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMGVEdDF3RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Not my first time dining at Ichikokudo, but the first time at Jurong Point outlet, so congrats on the opening! I had my favorite lite shoyu ramen and it was savoury, rich, and mildly sweet too, just like how I've always liked it to be. The garlic chicken karaage and sauce was delicious. Fried ebi was a little overcooked in my opinion. Nevertheless, my friend and I had a great dining experience. Very satisfied! :) Will come again to try the other flavours!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbU91ZFZnEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"The food, service and menu design feels very authentic and Hokkaido. Portions of food are rich and fulfilling. Customer service was prompt and polite.

A nice halal touch to traditional Japanese food. I will certainly be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMnYtMmxnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"New ramen shop, an additional option especially for the Malay friends, cos it’s Halal certified. Clean, nice setting. Taste of Ramen is flavourful, though it’s a bit salty for the regular. One can opt for the clear option if you prefer something more bland. Tasty in general, though the onsen egg is a bit overcooked and being halal, it’s chicken instead of pork.

Price is reasonable and a place I’ll come again, with my Malay friends along."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcnE2QlJREAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,"Went on boxing day Saturday evening just before 7pm and had to queue about 10 minutes.

Ordering is online via QR code and quite straight forward.

Waited for almost 20 minutes for our food which I think is a little long for ramen

I had the chicken based Ichikokudo Ramen (Extra Rich). Noodle texture was the best aspect of the ramen; stock was over salty and overpowered any chicken flavor. The chicken meat was not tender and stuck to the teeth. The egg was very ordinary.

My wife had the Hokkai Ramen Gifts from the Sea - Regular. The seafood was average at best. The stock way too salty even for someone like myself who likes salty food. At least the seafood stock wasn't too overpowered by the salt.

The iced green tea at $1.90 is a rip off. More like iced water with no green tea taste at all.

Overall 2 star rating for food and service staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcnVLQ2J3EAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Our usual Sat dinner at Jurong point, decide to try the new ramen restaurant since there is no queue. I know that I should order the ramen but was craving for rice so end up ordering a unagi toji don and it did not disappoint. Rice was soft and savoury, together with the well cooked unagi, it was pretty delicious. She got the limited lobster ramen and it came with a plastic glove, napkin, crab scissor and a wet wipe! Attention to details is amazing and the broth did not disappoint. Initially think that it could too thick but it wasn't, it was easy to drink and has a good punch of seafood taste. Noodle was good and lobster was not overcooked.

Rating: 8/10
I am coming back to try the remaining ramen!
Do come and try!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdnBEeC13RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Order:
- 121 and matcha latte
Taste:
- Pretty decent Japanese ramen, nothing too special, onsen egg is a bit over cooked ; matcha latte is rich in flavor and possibly pretty authentic
Environment:
- Quite some flies around, probably the common issue in JP B1 restaurants; compared to other restaurants it’s pretty empty
Service:
- Fast service, tho the staff almost dropped my ramen soup without realizing it.
Price:
- Affordable, in the cheap range for ramens.
Location:
- Easy to find."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dU02bGRREAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"First time here. We had the tomato & the original. It was ok. Tomato broth was pleasantly fragrantly, but the taste was on the stronger side. If you prefer something lighter, the Original is better. For me, nothing in particular yearns me to return. Gyoza was a tad too oily for my liking."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MnR1VUF3EAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"My first and last. The food not tasty at all. Unagi Don I ate are most terrible ever. I knew Unagi is full of bone, but this :( My cousin order the Sapporo Miso Ramen but the soup not like Miso is taste like butter soup."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaWVmbXdRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"This is my first time trying and it was totally horrible! Soup was salty and it just tasted awful even though I'm a fan of tomato soup. The vegetables and noodles were sticked together in the bowl like it was not well cooked and it was not warm. The wait was long even just for a bowl with no crowds and no napkins were served. Too bad I had to give 1 star to post if not I wouldn't give any star sorry to say.
Please don't try this dish 🙏🙏"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdC11UmZ3EAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Not sure why the divided reviews, but the noodles (at least my bowl of) tasted no different to the ones at urban malls. The chicken broth with hint of saba essence is fresh but no lack of punch, I especially like the addition of seaweeds that bring complexity to the soup. After 2/3 to finishing line, ask for a plate of fried garlic slices to bring the taste to next level!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOEllTDZRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,The outlet provides average fare at reasonable prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N0xmT1pBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,Abit different from the usual ramen broth since this is halal. Overall not bad experience but not my cup of tea. Ambience is good. Try out for novelty.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLUozcXF3RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"I used to enjoy this place very much and came for ramen for many times, but the latest visit really let me down. I ordered set lunch for the first time and it turned out to be a terrible decision: The soup is lukewarm, noodles are soggy, and the chicken char siew is half fat. As a result I was only able to finish less than half noodles and the rest are wasted. I won't go to this place again, so disappointed that the standard dropped trmendously. 1 star is given for the quick service btw."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eU9iTTdRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Came on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded. Food and drinks came across as rather mild compared to other restaurants but it tasted healthier too, so I'm quite okay with that. Price is affordable as well. Would come back again to try the ramen."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaHJlYVZnEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"The ramen taste is not bad for chicken based broth. Ordered the Ichikokudo extra rich Ramen and it came with shredded fish and chicken chasu. Ordered big fry ebi don too but it was disappointing. The rice came in big clumps and is super wet and sticky. Ebi fry is not crispy at all and super soft, like mochi texture. The egg contained prawns as well, too much for my preference but seafood lovers might like it? Gyoza skin is slightly thick and made using chicken as well, no dipping sauce was provided. The set comes with fruits not drinks so drinks have to be order d separately but green tea is refillable. Overall would not order the don again unless improvement is made to the rice and ebi fry. This place is Halal as well so an additional option for halal friends to dine at."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM2J1ZTZ3RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,Food is horrible especially for its price.Unagi don tasted so horrible and ramen was just salt.Never come to this place.Not a picky eater at all and will always finish food even if it’s bad but I just can’t finish it here.Goes to show how horrible the food is.Service was friendly and prompt.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbzVlbTdRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"The Mini karanegi chashu Don is extremely salty, feedback to the crew however claim it’s normal. That’s ridiculous!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ0lMVk9nEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,Great tasting ramen. Quality of the soup and noodles are made to excellent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX0tlQTNBRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,"hello Ichikokudo, I ordered the Ichi beef ramen as shown in the picture. It looks nowhere like the clear broth in the picture. The marinated egg was also missing, had to ask for it. Is this a case of false advertising or misrepresentation?

Food is good, just not what I ordered."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpN3EtaUxnEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Opening on 4th Dec 2020,
One of the best Halal Hokkaido Ramen in town. Try it if you haven’t."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cGEzX2R3EAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,"A very different chicken broth ramen at this halal ramen restaurant. Thought the flavour is rich, it is distinctly different in taste compared to your typical ramen."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMHRQTVpREAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Hi Ichikokudo! Here's my review (Food, Service & Ambience) for my dining experience today:

Food:
Ordered the limited edition Ichi-Mazesoba for a more adventurous palate. Usually would just go for the classic ichikokudo ramen but i wanted to try something different. Totally worth the experience! I loved how the sweetness from the sauce and the tanginess from the vinegar comes together. There is also a variety of texture from the crispy bits and diced onion. Really felt like a party going on in my mouth and it's really worth the try! The best part was the onsen egg, my favourite! It binds all the different elements together and combining it into one. Definitely will be back for this before it runs out!

Service:
The staffs there were really an amazing bunch! Came during the evening time and i will usually expect them to be drained but was otherwise. Welcomed me with great energy, greeted and assisted me generously and politely.

Ambience:
I was seated somewhere near the kitchen and it was nice to hear some chill music playing along. They were pretty soft... which is a bummer because i don't like silent meals but it was nice seeing the people there enjoy their working environment. I must say that most places i've been to, service crews will be just stuck one corner and watching customers as they come and go but for ichikokudo jurong point, the store itself felt alive with the vibrant energy from the staffs. It's pretty calming and enjoyable seeing them love doing what they do and still serve us greatly. It makes my experience here indeed more pleasant!

Overall, i'll be back for the yummy mazesoba and the lively atmosphere there :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTczdMZHpBRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,"Quite disappointing on the taste... Original supposed to be thicker in the broth than clear I supposed, however it was bland... The 'clear' version should be blah...  Ramen was softer than I expected..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dVBhaEJREAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,The 101 noodle is fine. Other is not as expected. The tea is terrible the cup is not for the hot tea.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMVlMN2pBRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,3,Ramen broth is a little too salty. Waitress told me in future could let them know.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOFotNnd3RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,"Today we eat the original ramen together with my husband at Jurong outlook, taste so wonderful. I finished till last drop of soup . Can say is the best ramen I have ever had so far. Love the bamboo shoots plus the slice mushroom, the combination is just too excellent, I can't have enough of it. Will come back again next week"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcVBiQnF3RRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"Extremely disappointed,  the taste was an absolutely amateur boring nothing special,  will never come to this restaurant ever again , wasted my money!"

2. Butter clams, not even hot enough to melt the butter cube."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa3UzSVlBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,The broth wasn't tasty and the clams were tasteless. The staff was dancing around with the songs blasting didn't give me a good dining experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbS0zdXpRRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"Decent halal-certified Ichikokudo Ramen with flavourful broth and egg. Broth reminds me of tsukumen. The namban chicken sides was good. Refillable green tea. Not much crowds on weekday lunch.

If u like garlic, the garlic chicken gives the kick along with cloves of cooked garlics."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNzllSjdnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,Nice foods.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHai03YkRBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,5,Great Food. Appetising. Great setting.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbHM2VndnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"Ordered ichi-ramen (original) with kaarage (set) and hokkai clam ramen. The soup base felt bland and was not hot. There was an alkaline taste with the noodles. The other ingredients, e.g. bamboo shoots, black fungus, felt cold too. The ""onsen"" egg was a huge disappointment. $4.50 for the add-on Kaarage set was also disappointing as the portion was very small (~abt 3 small pieces).

Hard to get attention of servers to re-fill the iced and hot green tea. The iced green tea was also like room temperature.

Through the dinner, there was also a pestering fly (we were seated at the booth seat area). This was also highlighted in other reviewers' comments.

Felt over-priced for the food and service quality.

-2 stars for the poor food experience.
-1 star for the lacking service.
-1 star for the pestering fly, which we couldn't wait to end the dinner and leave asap.

Definitely will not return.

PS: This might be an one-off incident, and maybe other food options on the menu could be better. Saw some customers ordered donburi dishes and they looked not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bnBLX2Z3EAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,1,"Went to Jurong Point's outlet on a Sunday. Was my 1st time and probably the last. My family of 6 were not let in to the restaurant when there's clearly an unoccupied table for 6 there. Had to talk to the worker and reason with him as to why he couldn't let us sit at that table. His reason being that table is too close to other tables (safety distancing measures) but all other occupied tables with customers seated are close to each other too. It made no sense and the worker finally let us sit there only when we said that we would like to speak to the manager about this matter. Upon sitting at the table, we were not given the menu after a good 5 minutes and had to approach the waiter to be given the menu. The waiter told us that the order is to be done via scanning a QR code but the QR code slip was not given to us. We were cluelessly finding the QR inside the menu when it was actually a printed QR code slip which is supposed to be given by the waiter. So we had to ask for the menu and also the QR code to be given to us. The food arrived fast but the soup tasted bland. Even the soup with the ""richest"" taste option selected tasted bland. The soup was barely warm too, not hot like a soup that is freshly cooked. The only thing that was nice were the onsen eggs.  Basically an unpleasant experience going there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbDlMQ3pnRRAB,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,4,"I liked the flavorful curry ramen, which has a really big portion that can feed 2 if you order one more side dish (if you are not a big eater). Gyoza has quite flavourful fillings and a just nice charred aroma. Service was quick and friendly and there was no big weekday lunch crowd. One star deducted for the fly that keeps disturbing me during my meal though, which is generally an issue for all the open air restaurants in JP basement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX296TWZBEAE,Ichikokudo Hokkaido Ramen,2,"I gave a 2star only because the sides of the Hokkai Seafood BBQ tasted off/sour.. (like those u will find in example: mixed veg rice the vegetables left for quite awhile it starts to go bad). The Ramen was good though.. Hope the team will conduct regular checks during their off peak..

Hi Sir/Mdm,

My visit was at 07/04/21 17:27 and table 56.

I just want to feedback for you and your team to take note as other customers might not be that understanding or forgiving.

Your food is good, don't let the good name be pulled down by these small areas.."

The menu has quite a bit of options - a decent number for vegetarian. The set I ordered had a starter, main course and dessert.

I chose mushroom soup (also has interesting option like samosas) , vegetarian pasta. The dessert is quite standard- choco lava cake with ice cream. It comes about 18.8 S$.

Don’t miss this place if you are in NTU."

Charge for water, menu online prices have all been raised in restaurant. Avoidable."

Great ambience, professional and friendly service crew, overall a fantastic respite within NTU. However, the food items were hit-or-miss. The salmon was fantastic, but the steak was... let’s just say, even a hawker stall could deliver better. Fries were tasty...pork fajita was alright, nothing really remarkable...

I’d give it a positive review only because on both occasions I patronised, I hadn’t paid the full price: first time was with an eatigo 50% discount, the next was for their $14 set lunch. Without these discounts, I’d feel disappointingly shortchanged, given the quality of the food - certainly does not command the à la carte prices, in my opinion.

It has the potential to become a five-star establishment, as long as the consistency of the food quality improves. Everything else (service, ambience) is already in place for an excellent dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeTVIR1RREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,"We booked the private area dining to host guests on Tuesday. The halal set meal came more than an hour late. The restaurant was not apologetic and did not inform us at all until we checked with the kitchen. We booked the private area dining for Thursday but we wanted to postpone it one day before due to medical concerns. The restaurant did not allow postponement, did not propose alternative solution and was not willing to negotiate at all about the whole situation. There was completely no flexibility and no compassion. We were told that we will be charged regardless and the food will be served. Fine. We went for the lunch and are now eating in the restaurant. There is a fly in my glass as I am writing this review now."

A quiet respite that lifts you away from the hustle and bustle of university life. Food was great - ordered the tender beef cheeks cooked to perfection and the crabmeat pasta fully infused with the flavour of crab. Menu is on the pricier side ($18-$30 for mains) excl. service charge and GST but the quality of food is great. Would definitely visit again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbk5LaWhBRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",2,Super expensive place to eat! Peri peri chicken main portion was so so small! Taste nothing to race about. Salmon main was okay. The chicken tikka pizza was good though. Ice lemon tea drinks were so diluted. No lemon taste at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZzRIVGNREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"This place is located at the heart of NTU in Northspine! (Near the KFC). I was decently surprised by the ambience! It was cosy and comforting.

I ordered the beef cheeks, pork loin fajita, wagyu burger and lava cake.

The Wagyu burger was disappointing. It cost a whopping 18 dollars! However, the patty was really bland. There was no seasoning at all. I had to add my own pepper and salt to the patty to make it tasty. The onions were raw and not grilled. However, I have to say that the fries were good! ($18)

Next, the beef cheeks were soft and tender to the bone. Sauce was decent and mash potato is creamy! However, there's not enough sauce to pair with the mash potato as it was paired with the beef cheeks. (Preferred the fries). They could have been more generous with the salad portion. Overall a bit too pricey for this dish. ($22)

Lastly, the pork loin fajita was surprisingly good!! Pork was cooked and seasoned well! It was paired with onions which was good as well! The combination with the wrap and the pork was really delicious. It even came with a side of sour cream and guacamole! Overall a really really good dish that I recommend :)) It was the cheapest out of the 3 main dish. ($16)

When dessert came, I was pleasantly surprised on the presentation of the dish. The lava cake came off a bit sweet but paired really well with the vanilla ice cream. (Although they probably used a cheap ice cream brand) A great way to end the meal :) ($6)

Overall, dish place is a must try if you have the money as it comes off a little pricey. Would recommend if you are finding a place to splurge. Till we meet again, au revoir!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXZXcDVRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Great place to have a drink if you're on NTU's campus.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNGRIY25RRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"This place gets 5 stars as it is the only good joint that accepts reservations at NTU...

Pretty decent selection of food and drinks. Service can always be better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Z0lEZ09nEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"The waygu burger is nice. Thick juicy Patty on buttery bun
Fajitas is nice too. Lots of meat. Yum.
Molten lava lorte is a must have.
Apple crumble ok ok

New branding, new menu.
Grats on re opening.
Had 3 course set lunch 14 SGD nett. Most affordable from the menu already.
Mushroom soup🥰 - creamy, heavy yet watery, truffle oil can't taste. Garlic butter bread was nice too.
Beef strip loin🙂 - Doneness medium rare but come out medium. Lightly seasoned. Tasted okay. Chewy and tough. Paired with sauce or salt and pepper to enchance it.
Brownie 😋 - Super moist, chocolatey and fudgy. Shiok. Must try.

Good ambient, place cooling, service indeed is great.
This their soft launch menu. So subject to change."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaE9qVHRBRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Nice Atmosphere!!! Friendly Staffs
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bktuX1l3EAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,Nice food and nice view! And very amazing prize for a whole set at only 14 dollars . Will definitely visit again with my future girl friend ( if I have hahaha )
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaEtuZzZ3RRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Wonderful place to eat! The staff is very friendly amd the food is great
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBa3RmWkRnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,Nice restaurant in NTU. Food is good. Recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc1B1bGxRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,Food is of worse quality than earlier. Staff was not very helpful. Angus beef was chewy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVd0tfbFhBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Often they have offers that make the food affordable. I used to like when they had beer hours that include tasting various beers at a good price. Regular pricing is a bit on a high side considering that their location is in the campus and most students can't enjoy the services. Staff is always friendly however, they tend to force guests to occupy a table they might not necessarily like. As a guest, you need to have a feeling you're welcome. In general, food is alright, however, when you're taking a burger, try to let them know that you want a fresh bun, otherwise you're stuck with the older. I do occasionally go and bring a friend so you might try as well. This will help them improve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaFpTcTNnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Average restaurant food you can find in NTU. Steak was bad, other food ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZazdLelFREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,This is a nice place to check out in NTU when students are looking to treat themselves to some good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3Z29fbGVBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Food is decent, especially the ones from the menu. The main attraction of this place is the heathy salad bowls - however, they have reduced the options and items to be included in the body's since the time it was first introduced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaE9qeE5BEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"good vibes and friendly staff! food here is really good as well, will recommend !!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOE03X1NnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",2,"OK. So the redeux is nice.  It looks nice and the menu is better.
Margarita tasted like pure juice and sour which was a bummer.

As for the food, I think they are missing the best point of having a SW US or Mexican menu:  You only have to stock 10-15 ingredients to make DOZENS of
different southern dishes!!!

My suggestion, and I mean this with best intentions.
Offer plain everything in the menu, then make proteins add-ons.  You are punishing vegetarians by charging full price to remove the meat.  Or even punishing anyone that isn't in the mood for a particular protein.
Adding a surcharge to change proteins is not cool.  2 bucks extra to sub prawn for chicken is kinda crazy.
Go basic + add-ons is my best suggestion.

Best of luck to you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMlk2aTlRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,Tasty food but there was a small dead cockroach in my mocktail. Ruined an otherwise tasty lunch.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbGV6OVdBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Very nice ambience and good food. Mr Sara is so courteous and customer centric person and Ms Skyler is so prompt in her service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5OXBfRVRREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"Re-opened with a new menu.  Main courses and desserts were great along with the service.  We had dinner and the prices were reasonable considering the comfort, view and proper restaurant service.  Really great addition to NTU if you need some cool comfort after a long day of study/work."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2N2FQTjZRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"The service was ok. However, the food was pretty low quality. I had a 50% off voucher and I still felt it was overpriced for what it was. After reading the other reviewers maybe I should not have ordered the steak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaDcyU3l3RRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"Really nice place with nice ambience. The staff there are very friendly and professional as well! Definitely a good hidden corner in ntu for a getaway from campus life to enjoy some fine dining. Food is nice as well, love the jalapeño poppers!!! Rare to see such a dish and it was done superbly well. Will highly recommend to check out this place! Do try the wagyu burger as well, and the lava cake and pecan pie are off the charts."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMGNUdTdnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,They’ve got the best honey lemon tart.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMVBpenZnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Nice ambience and food especially good service and friendly from Lynn..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMnRla1VnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",2,"food was really expensive and not tasty, not worth it even with burpple 1-for-1 😅"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX0lpb3pnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Five stars . Good place for respite when overwhelmed with the university work. Loved the lunch menu variety. Steak was great and sides were a great complement.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTZmTFhnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Fish and chips was delightful!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eXJyOERBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Recently reopened with a new menu. The $14 set lunch is a good deal. One of the only places in NTU to have food with service other than Cosmo restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNU9MaHBnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,The pork ribs were tender and the portion was quite big. Value for money at $16.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX292S0V3EAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"fancy and clean place in ntu, nice to have an important appointment. however, the service is not good with the slow waiters and waitresses, which delays everything"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dmJEU3RRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Food was disappointing for the price point. Only giving it 2 stars because it’s the only fancy place in NTU

Brownie was good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNXzQtTnVRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,If you go at peak hours be ready to wait for an hour for your food and when it arrives it might not even be what you ordered. They clearly need to hire more staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M3F5alBBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"SUPER YUMMY, TRY THE LAVA CAKE"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdFlhd3JnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,Nice location and with a great view.  Not many options of beer on tap -  they only have archipelago lager and summer ipa. The salad is quite popular.
ChNDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXLWxzEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,Used to go here often.  Lunch time can be crowded

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjhfTG5BRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Didn’t expect a meal so lovely before we went. The head chef apprenticed in Japan and the dishes are elegant, beautiful and yummy… the restaurant is a fabulous combination of traditional style and modern style… we had a very pleasant time there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNGY3dXRnRRAB,TANOKE,5,"The food was great in overall, in particular the squid and the uni hand roll. We felt that the mushrooms could have been done better, it seemed to be lacking in flavour/fragrance. The sake selection was unique. The ambience was nice! Recommended to try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLWJTSEZREAE,TANOKE,4,It's a Japanese fusion place. Food and service was great. Opted for the restaurant week menu and portions were very reasonable. They have quite a good selection of sakes available too. Place is not too big (though they do have two levels) so reservation would still be recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd19EOXBRRRAB,TANOKE,5,"A delightful and enjoyable dining experience!
All the dishes were on point.
Got a complimentary birthday dessert too!
Great service from the friendly host, Zamzi.
Would definitely come back here again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOFotVmJ3EAE,TANOKE,5,"Had such a lovely experience dining at Tanoke! Chanced upon them last month during the Nespresso Singapore Restaurant week and made a reservation for my partner’s birthday for their 4-course dinner menu.

Everything served was fantastic, my partner and I enjoyed them all. Service was excellent as well. Would definitely be back again some day :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3Itc0VBEAE,TANOKE,5,Amazing food & service was great! Would love to visit again and try other dishes! 👍🏻 We liked the ambience too. Felt cozy there! They were able to accommodate to our little request as well which we very much appreciate! Keep up the good work :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHZpVldREAE,TANOKE,4,"Nestled on L2, this place exudes a cosy exclusive atmosphere, although it can get a mite noisy as the dining floor is rather small. Reservations necessary given the limited capacity. Good food, goes well with the extensive sake list."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd0lqdnRnRRAB,TANOKE,5,"super good experience at tanoke. came on a public holiday and despite the crowd, service was on point and attentive.

the food we ordered all came at a good pace. serving was just nice for my family, but for big eaters may feel their rice bowl & sando portions of be a little small. the food were all well seasoned and very nicely presented.

For dessert, our favourite is the panna cotta followed by smores tart then the shiso lychee sorbet (although it is quite a good palette cleanser) likewise for the yuzu ice cream (i recommend it)  👍🏻

Overall, would definitely return for another meal 🥰"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdDg3ZmJnEAE,TANOKE,5,"This has to be marked as not just the best fine dining Japanese, but one of the best fine dining period. Spectacular food. Great atmosphere. Fantastic service from Iries. Extremely reasonable price. We’ll make a habit of going back for sure."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdGJ6anRnRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Had such an enjoyable time at tanoke! The space was beautiful and ambiance was really nice. Special shoutout to Nareeth and chef Ken for helping me arrange a little surprise. Extremely attentive to details and needs of customers, definitely will be back! :) However, note that portions are quite small and if you have a huge appetite, the food may not be substantial."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcGFXZkRREAE,TANOKE,4,"The ambience was good, but the food had some that were hits (the karaage) and some that were misses (the uni in the seafood bowl wasn't fresh - it had become a bit watery)

I think Tanoke would be a good place to come for sake (they have a wide collection) and have some of the appetisers with the sake. That I will give 5 stars. But for dinner, it falls a bit short."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtODdlTGlnRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Great food, great service.

If I could eat the Hamachi Carpaccio every day I would. Perfectly seasoned and a burst of joy with each mouthful.

Highly recommend the beef bowl and wagyu sliders. The chicken karaage was ok but probably only seemed average in contrast with the outstanding taste of the other dishes we had.

Got there 3 minutes before the happy hour wagyu slider promotion ended and our server was very kind to quickly lock it in for us. Very good value of a delicious slider with our sake ordered. Will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdTVUdDNRRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Good ambience, great service and awesome food
Ordered the aus waygu beef medium rare! It was perfectly medium rare! Savoury, well seared and melt in the mouth :)

Impressed with the otoro roll, iberico pork jowl, egg plant, black truffle udon and matcha pannacota!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta2EtVmx3RRAB,TANOKE,5,"It's located on the 2nd floor of a shop house. The ambience is good. Staff is friendly.
Food is nice & the salad is fresh. Australian Striploin bowl is my favorite. Pork bowl is also nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXRlZTh3RRAB,TANOKE,5,We went for a Sunday Brunch at Tanoke. The food was a delight especially the 3-cut Wagyu platter. We ordered medium-rare and each cut of the wagyu meat melts in your mouth😋 I love the ambience of the place as well as the design and the lights. The service is splendid and friendly . Overall experience was excellent and we enjoyed it much👍👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPakxpYjlRRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Real authentic taste with modern twist. The rice of the signature Rice bowl is so damn good with right balance of truffle taste, furikake and pickled cucumber. I don’t eat beef but I had a taste of the rice, and it’s amazing. I’m sure the beef is vy nice too. The temaki, grilled hamachi and grilled assorted mushrooms with butter, are yummy too. Tbh I didn’t expect the simple mushroom to be this addictive. Hope to see more non beef choices on menu, provided they manage to up their manpower. Shortage of manpower happens at every industry at this time, sigh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaEw2V2Z3EAE,TANOKE,5,"I mean I love Japanese food but I come to realise that I love the Japanese fusion even better. I think their seasonal set menu is really well designed and every dish is a hit in my opinion. The Hamachi Carpaccio is super refreshing and well balanced with tomato ricotta cheese come afterwards. Wagyu platter is a must order, I was super full when this dish came but it just tasted so great and I just couldn’t stop eating. On top of that, the service is excellent, thank you Iries and Nareenth !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd19qSEZREAE,TANOKE,5,"Stumbled upon this shop on a rainy day and we were pleasantly surprised! Service was great, and zamzi recommended a great bottle of sake to go with the food.

Food was tasty and prices were reasonable! We ordered otoro handrolls and they were pretty generous with the ingredients. Ordered the beef bowl and the Australian striploin beef and rice was well seasoned. Also ordered the ika and we absolutely loved the combination of seasoning + sauce!

Overall the food and service really made an impression on us and we really enjoyed it! We will definitely be back for more :))"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdE5TYVdBEAE,TANOKE,5,Probably the best Karaage I had so far in Singapore. Price point is very reasonable and every dish was great. Seasoning was on point too. Great selection of sake. Will definitely come back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaTRuWE5nEAE,TANOKE,5,"Excellent food and service, ambience was eclectic and nice. Servers were prompt and friendly, we had the beef bowl and iberico pork bowl, both were wonderful. Come at lunch for their sets, value for money, and the food is outstanding! We will be back :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmNYZ2p3RRAB,TANOKE,2,"Sister restaurant of Kabuke’s, the concept of this place is somewhat similar. Beef bowls, Uni, Sake. The food here didn’t blow my mind away, but the service was excellent. We were served by Nareenth and Iris and they were great folks. Their famed Aburi Ootoro hand roll was a massive disappointment, with the seaweed slightly soggy (I ate it almost immediately), Uni obviously not in its best quality and rather tough altogether. Truffle hamachi carpaccio looks nice but I couldn’t taste any truffle from the pieces itself. Their sliders saved the day for me, along with their service. To be honest, I’ve never liked Kabuke and I dragged my feet to Tanoke. While I’m glad that I finally checked out Tanoke, I felt the food’s quality was on the same level as that of Kabuke’s. For the more discerning customer, you might feel slightly short-changed as everything that’s supposedly fancy on the menu do not deliver at all in terms of quality and taste. This is the same problem with Kabuke too. I doubt I’ll return again but thanks for the effusive service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeWFLYkZnEAE,TANOKE,5,"Restaurant is tucked in a corner on level 2, Purvis Street, one might miss the entrance if one were to walk too fast. I was there on a weekday night for dinner for my birthday celebration and was seated on level 3, which was private enough for a group of 5 pax. Ordered their newly created set dinner for 4-5pax. Service was impeccable, quality of food was served was of top quality. Food was delectable, to our delight.

In addition, the restaurant took note to serve the next dishes only when we have completed the previous one with a short time gap to ensure food prepared is warm, which many mediocre F&Bs are lacking in. Restaurant also allowed us to bring our own cake which is a plus point.

Special shout out to Zamzi, Iries, Nareenth who introduced and every dish serve, and patiently helped us to take photos and a gifted us a complimentary birthday shot of sake.

Overall it was a very pleasant and delightful dining experience. Highly recommended restaurant indeed, will be back!

Thank you Tanoke Team!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcDRLaEpREAE,TANOKE,4,Food is really good and service crew is very friendly! like Otoro Aburi Handroll and Black Truffle Cold Udon the most 😍😍 Lamb Ribs is average but Spicy Baby Corn is quite good 😁 *Bonus* they gave my friend a little birthday surprise when we're about to leave 🥰 thank you for taking note on my reservation comment that I almost forgot 🤣
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2clpiSHV3RRAB,TANOKE,5,"Tanoke is a recent partner to my company and also only in recent did I get the chance to head on into Tanoke to try the dinner menu with our members. Twice I've been here for dinner and once for lunch, and never once was I ever disappointed. In fact the portions are so huge for both our dinner set ($128++ or something in that range) and the portion is generous! I'm disappointed at my own shrunk appetite for not being able to finish my ricecovered in truffle shavings!

The wagyu, it melts in your mouth, the grilled lamb omg that char—grill on it is perfect! The rice with the onsen tamago in it, and nothing but black truffle shavings on top, it's luxury at its best. And let's not forgot those appetisers that build up to the main course that you'd have thought could not get any better. Oh it does, it SO does.

I super love the sushi of uni, with ikura wrapped in crispy seaweed, with some gold flakes on top and a side of deep fried gobo shavings. It's all so good! And the portion, they're so generous with the uni that it's spilling out!

Let's not forget the dessert! The first time I was there I tasted their sorbet, not just any, but a shiso with Lychee sorbet, it's an acquired taste, but I so love how it cleanse the palate and makes you want to continue eating even more! The second time I visited, I had the gin infused jam with matcha panna cotta, speechless good. Its so silky, smooth and omg so wonderfully easy to keep eating it despite how filling all the other dishes before makes you.

If ever you need some drinks to go with your food. Everyone in the restaurant are well-versed in their knowledge of sake and could recommend good sake pairings for each of your dishes too. I love how intimate the mezzanine is, and it's just so cozy up there in the private space that I wish the night of fun dining will just keep continuing.

I'm always back for more, especially to try out their lunch menu, and omg it is so so SO GOOD! They serve mainly dons in the afternoon, but the miso soup is so good, I wish I could have just had more. And the staff are so kind to pair my grilled pork don with a glass of sakura sake.

I'm already missing the food and dishes, especially the grilled baby corns only avail in lunch! Super looking forward to going back to dine there once again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcS1DaDdRRRAB,TANOKE,5,"This is now our favourite restaurant !

Restaurant week menu is superb - from 2 appetisers to main course (Yellowtail cheek) to dessert + Nespresso .

Nareeth & Iries were very friendly . Nareeth was very patient in explaining the menu and highly recommended yellowtail cheek (Hamachi Kama) & he is right ! The fish was fresh and just simply delicious! We also paired with 4 types of sake and they matched the dishes so well.

We couldn’t wait to share the joy with the rest of family and have since made reservation for our family of 5 to visit again later this week. Looking forward to another delicious dinner with our family :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdTZyY1VREAE,TANOKE,5,"Highly recommend this humble restaurant. Food was great, portion is good and value for money! I highly recommend the rib eye, the otoro wrap, egg plant as side dish and also the cold udon!!! Thank you Nareenth and Zamzi for your great service too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWM3RmJ3EAE,TANOKE,5,Taste and quality of the food was great. Friendly service. Complimentary birthday dessert and sake were greatly appreciated. Reservation recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb2VTbHpBRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Tanoke is located on the second floor on a shophouse.  We decided to drop by as the other popular restaurants were full but we are happy with what life brought us.

First the service, Mr Rao was there to follow up on the food and ensuring our water glass is never half filled.  In fact, for one of the dishes, he noticed that something was amiss and brought it back to the kitchen.  So this is someone who takes pride in his work.

We opted for the Happy hour sake which comes with a mini wagyu burger and burdock chips.  A good start.  We went for the set and it is extremely well priced as it comes with 2 appetizers(one of which is a hamachi carpaccio), 2 gigantic desserts, a substantial portion of 3 types of wagyu and a few other items.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the Kagoshima ribeye the most.

All in all, a great find and I hope more people will appreciate them to keep them in business.  Not every restaurant has earned this but I feel they have."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aDdlTDFnRRAB,TANOKE,4,"Great discovery by my husband. Food is nice n Instagramable with very reasonable price. Since we dun eat beef, Waiter is friendly n helpful with great recommendation! Lamb n carpaccio with truffle is must try ! Satisfied dinner 😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2anMyOW5nRRAB,TANOKE,5,"Came here for my husband’s birthday and had a wonderful experience. The staff were super attentive and friendly, the food was such a treat, everything tasted so good.
We had the aburi otoro handroll, lamb rack (this was **chefs kiss** best of the night), spicy baby corn, tanoke classic bowl (strip loin), pork jowl, shisho lychee sorbet (super refreshing) and matcha pannacotta."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtemVqTU9nEAE,TANOKE,5,"Food was great (sliders were amongst the best we’ve had), ambience was cozy for quiet dinner dates, and the service from Nareenth was top notch! (: will return again to try their brunch menu"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHanQtdmRBEAE,TANOKE,5,"We had Katsu chicken truffle sando and Australian Wagyu sando and they were both amazing!! Their matcha panna cotta was good too. Their service was beyond excellent!! Thank you Zamzi, Iries and Nareeth!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHZtbjhBRRAB,TANOKE,5,Had a wonderful experience dining at Tanoke for Nespresso Restaurant week!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnNTaERREAE,TANOKE,5,"One of the best sake tasting I have been. Waitress and Waiter service is superb excellent. Thanks Iries & Nareen. Excellent place and very tasty lunch. Must try
Thumbs up 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeEwtYzdBRRAB,TANOKE,5,"A true hidden gem!  Tucked away discreetly on the second floor of a shop lot on Purvis street, you won’t notice it unless you go looking.

Hands down, probably the best meal I’ve had in Singapore.  We started with the Hamachi Carpaccio that was topped with generous truffles shaving and ikura, drizzled with truffle shoyu - the yellow tail was so fresh and every bite was simply a flavour bomb hit!  Next came the Tanoke Beef Bowl (rib eye).  It was a masterpiece, where the meat just melts in your mouth, so tender, juicy and cooked just right. The creamy yolk from the onsen egg made it the perfect sauce to go with the Niigata rice.  Soooo yumms.

They also do Sake pairing but not much of a drinker…. But definitely a must if you are a sake lover.

Also love the sleek decor & vibe, making it a great place for date nights or girlie get together.  Staff were all attentive and ready to serve.

Can’t wait to come back and try more items on the menu.  Highly recommend!!"

Nareeth, thank you for making our evening so enjoyable, and ensuring that we didn’t over order. You have such good knowledge of your products and a wonderful passion for your job. We really appreciate that. Cheers!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaHJXY3ZnRRAB,TANOKE,5,We took the Set Dinner which was offered during the Diningcity promotion ($78).   Food was very delicious and service was good!  Highly recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbS1hYVRnEAE,TANOKE,5,"Room for improvement but a good first visit nonetheless. Found Tanoke on restaurant week's list and booked to try but ended going ala carte instead. Nestled in small cosy space on the second floor of a shoplot building at Purvis St. Chic modern interior accentuated with the play of light. Quite a few favourites but after having 9 dishes off the menu, I found some of the elements used to be repetitive. Would love to see more variation in flavour and style.

We started of with the otoro aburi handroll and they were accomodating to cook one of the fish more and shift some of the toppings over to mine so I had 2 portions of uni and ikura(in pictures). We loved the wagyu marmalade toast and made a second order if it. The sweet buttery finish on the crisp toast and rich umami mash of braised wagyu complimented perfectly with the dollop of yuzukosho cream.

Refreshing, sweet tomatoes and tart vinaigrette a top creamy thick mascarpone tofu. Love! It's like a fusion take on italian tomatoes and burrata. Definitely order this. 3-cut wagyu platter failed to make an impression. These had a beautiful smokey aroma when served. A5 Kyushu tenderloin, A5 Kagoshima ribeye and MB7 Australian striplion. Meats were cut too thin, 1-1.5cm thick. Tenderloin had the best mouth feel and melts but was cooked done, no pink probably as it was cut the thinnest. The Ribeye section we got was bottom half fat and some pieces with gristle. Striploin is forgettable.

Even grilling on the US jumbo asparagus. Bonito flakes and yuzukosho cream made all the difference for this simple dish. Koji aged NZ coastal baby lamb, semi-frenched. Appreciated the clean cut, less fat and well seasoned outer char. Tender and juicy without any gamey scent. Great if you aren't a fan of fatty cuts. One day air dried flying squid was overkilled in chili flakes and meat itself was rather flat. I wouldn't recommend this. Iberico pork jowl with sweet karashi mayo. Decent but again overkilled in chili flakes. The mayo helped here. Love that it was served with pickled radish slices on the side.

Nice jiggly matcha pannacotta with strawberry jam and pistachio nuts to finish off the meal. The  Smores Tartlet would have been perfect if not for the marshmallows being extremely chewy. I shared that perhaps the marshmallows were not toasted long enough to caramelize and melt inside, or the ice cream on top made them harden back too fast. The tart shell was perfect, thin and cracked easily while holding firm. Lots of melty dark chocolate at the base and bits of raspberry inside that brought it all together. This was waved off the bill after my feedback and the kitchen agreed that this could be improved.

Naren took great care of us during our visit. I was offered a complimentary sake to try and was served the Senkin Modern Moku Junmai Ginjo."

Now it same floors brings new exciting food and beverage paring adventures."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ3Rfd0VREAE,TANOKE,4,a phenomenal dining experience! my second time back at tanoke and the experience was as good as the first. The highlight of the night had to be the Otoro Aburi Handroll- definitely order this. The other dishes we ordered were spectacular as well but as the night progresses I got really full as the portions are pretty substantial! This is not a bad thing surely if you come in a big group and reservations are incredibly easy to make for some reason! The dishes took very long to be served hence the deduction of 1 star. If you are not ravenous this place would be perfect for a quiet date night
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycVBlZTh3RRAB,TANOKE,5,Had an amazing team dinner here. Top notch food and great value for the quality. Every dish was meticulously prepared and presented. The service was just as good if not better. Special mention to Nareenth who took care of our group. He was always there but never intrusive - that is top class service. Will definitely be back.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla0tDb0JBEAE,TANOKE,5,"A really cosy and beautiful place. Such wonderful and warm service from the lady who attended to us. The service is definitely top-notch, coming over to check on how we like our food, making recommendations and refilling our water glasses ever so often. Really made us feel super relaxed and comfortable.

The food was creatively plated. Especially the delicate cod with miso that I ordered, portions were quite small, but much detail went into the plating which I appreciated. Love the touch of charred lime which brings such refreshing lift to a dish that may usually be over salty. Love that! The lamb rack was also delicious and tender. Would love to try more dishes next time! A definite recommend!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dDRuSVlnEAE,TANOKE,5,"What an enjoyable experience! Sure some kinks here and there, not perfect, but definitely has so much going for it that I wholeheartedly give a 5 star review!!

The manager was warm, attentive, very genuine and friendly. He explained the composition of each dish and also the beginnings of the restaurant as a scale up from the previous gastrobar.

Went there to sample the restaurant week menu.

The yellowtail is to-die-for, one of the best that I've tasted. The cook on the lamb was so good, it was tender and had none of the gamey flavour, although the marination could be improved to impart more flavour.

The sirloin was so good, the marbling so rich that it melted in the mouth and hardly needed any condiments to accompany it.

Desserts probably could be improved further. The s'mores tart was overpowering in it's sweetness, there really wasn't much else going for it. The matcha panna cotta was so much better, and well matched by the tart was of the raspberry jam.

The yuzu sake recommended was spot on and was delightful in its citrusy flavour and subtle sweetness.

This is a restaurant where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Hope to see this restaurant grow from strength to strength, and I will be back to sample again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeDhpQjN3RRAB,TANOKE,5,"The food here is top notch, every dish carefully thought through. The Japanese Fruit Tomato dish was layered with multiple flavour bombs, simple but delicious! Extremely great service provided by Nareenth who really made the dining experience very enjoyable!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbzdXTENBEAE,TANOKE,5,Understated from the outside; all substance in the menu. One of the best finds in Singapore.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bUlQM29nRRAB,TANOKE,4,Like a secret clubhouse. We enjoyed the drinks and food. It's not the cheapest sake place to chill but worth the trip. Kanpai 🍶🥳
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLODdhaVJ3EAE,TANOKE,4,"Visited the restaurant during restaurant week. Great ambient and the food was delicious overall. Service was prompt and friendly. Both the Amuse Bouche, Hamachi Carpaccio were full of umami and love it. However, the main couse - wagyu striploin was not the best cut as it is kind of chewy, otherwise, it would be a perfect dinner. The macha panna cotta dessert is a must have and not overly sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdnRTWHRRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"Place is not the most convenient in Singapore but the restaurant is rather quiet, good for people who want a quieter environment. Servers are friendly and helpful. Ordered chicken quesadilla, beef fajita and braised beef cheeks. Portions are above average sized. Beef cheeks were soft and flavorful. Quesadilla was not overly cheesy. Fajita was average. Guacamole texture and consistency could be better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbnV5TGl3RRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"The lunchtime 3-course meal is nice and affordable. The meats are on the more expensive side, but the main dishes are pretty good and fairly priced. The atmosphere was very relaxing and chill."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLemNuX3dBRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"This place is located inside NTU. It has a good ambience and suits both small groups and couples who look for a good dinner date.

The menu has quite a bit of options - a decent number for vegetarian. The set I ordered had a starter, main course and dessert.

I chose mushroom soup (also has interesting option like samosas) , vegetarian pasta. The dessert is quite standard- choco lava cake with ice cream. It comes about 18.8 S$.

Don’t miss this place if you are in NTU."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjk3Y2tnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"Ambience is good.
A bit on the expensive side.
Food is well presented but nothing fantastic.
Service - nothing much to talk about."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc05QSGxnRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,"Terrible experience. Called to reserve, told us to walk in. Walked in, said tables are booked. Waited for table, then began painful check in experience. Food was subpar, only good thing was the view. Bread was about a week old (see photo). Charge for water, menu online prices have all been raised in restaurant. Avoidable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHRiNlZnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"really nice ambience and quick service, plus the food was honestly pretty good! i really liked the peach lemonade too~"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLajg2X053EAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"Do yourselves a favour and avoid the steak!

Great ambience, professional and friendly service crew, overall a fantastic respite within NTU. However, the food items were hit-or-miss. The salmon was fantastic, but the steak was... let’s just say, even a hawker stall could deliver better. Fries were tasty...pork fajita was alright, nothing really remarkable...

I’d give it a positive review only because on both occasions I patronised, I hadn’t paid the full price: first time was with an eatigo 50% discount, the next was for their $14 set lunch. Without these discounts, I’d feel disappointingly shortchanged, given the quality of the food - certainly does not command the à la carte prices, in my opinion.

It has the potential to become a five-star establishment, as long as the consistency of the food quality improves. Everything else (service, ambience) is already in place for an excellent dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeTVIR1RREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,"We booked the private area dining to host guests on Tuesday. The halal set meal came more than an hour late. The restaurant was not apologetic and did not inform us at all until we checked with the kitchen. We booked the private area dining for Thursday but we wanted to postpone it one day before due to medical concerns. The restaurant did not allow postponement, did not propose alternative solution and was not willing to negotiate at all about the whole situation. There was completely no flexibility and no compassion. We were told that we will be charged regardless and the food will be served. Fine. We went for the lunch and are now eating in the restaurant. There is a fly in my glass as I am writing this review now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeTd2UEh3EAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Very good ambience. Pricey but worth the experience. Closes early else it'll be even better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXNLempBRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"Came here for a nice, quiet dinner on a Tuesday evening during school term. A quiet respite that lifts you away from the hustle and bustle of university life. Food was great - ordered the tender beef cheeks cooked to perfection and the crabmeat pasta fully infused with the flavour of crab. Menu is on the pricier side ($18-$30 for mains) excl. service charge and GST but the quality of food is great. Would definitely visit again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbk5LaWhBRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",2,Super expensive place to eat! Peri peri chicken main portion was so so small! Taste nothing to race about. Salmon main was okay. The chicken tikka pizza was good though. Ice lemon tea drinks were so diluted. No lemon taste at all.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZzRIVGNREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"This place is located at the heart of NTU in Northspine! (Near the KFC). I was decently surprised by the ambience! It was cosy and comforting.

I ordered the beef cheeks, pork loin fajita, wagyu burger and lava cake.

The Wagyu burger was disappointing. It cost a whopping 18 dollars! However, the patty was really bland. There was no seasoning at all. I had to add my own pepper and salt to the patty to make it tasty. The onions were raw and not grilled. However, I have to say that the fries were good! ($18)

Next, the beef cheeks were soft and tender to the bone. Sauce was decent and mash potato is creamy! However, there's not enough sauce to pair with the mash potato as it was paired with the beef cheeks. (Preferred the fries). They could have been more generous with the salad portion. Overall a bit too pricey for this dish. ($22)

Lastly, the pork loin fajita was surprisingly good!! Pork was cooked and seasoned well! It was paired with onions which was good as well! The combination with the wrap and the pork was really delicious. It even came with a side of sour cream and guacamole! Overall a really really good dish that I recommend :)) It was the cheapest out of the 3 main dish. ($16)

When dessert came, I was pleasantly surprised on the presentation of the dish. The lava cake came off a bit sweet but paired really well with the vanilla ice cream. (Although they probably used a cheap ice cream brand) A great way to end the meal :) ($6)

Overall, dish place is a must try if you have the money as it comes off a little pricey. Would recommend if you are finding a place to splurge. Till we meet again, au revoir!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaE9paFVREAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"I loved the food, service and staff! Great selection of food. Wonderful atmosphere and ambience. 10/10 would come again. Ps wear a jacket, it’s cold!"

Pretty decent selection of food and drinks. Service can always be better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Z0lEZ09nEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",4,"The waygu burger is nice. Thick juicy Patty on buttery bun
Fajitas is nice too. Lots of meat. Yum.
Molten lava lorte is a must have.
Apple crumble ok ok

New branding, new menu.
Grats on re opening.
Had 3 course set lunch 14 SGD nett. Most affordable from the menu already.
Mushroom soup🥰 - creamy, heavy yet watery, truffle oil can't taste. Garlic butter bread was nice too.
Beef strip loin🙂 - Doneness medium rare but come out medium. Lightly seasoned. Tasted okay. Chewy and tough. Paired with sauce or salt and pepper to enchance it.
Brownie 😋 - Super moist, chocolatey and fudgy. Shiok. Must try.

Good ambient, place cooling, service indeed is great.
This their soft launch menu. So subject to change."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc1B1bGxRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,Food is of worse quality than earlier. Staff was not very helpful. Angus beef was chewy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVd0tfbFhBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Often they have offers that make the food affordable. I used to like when they had beer hours that include tasting various beers at a good price. Regular pricing is a bit on a high side considering that their location is in the campus and most students can't enjoy the services. Staff is always friendly however, they tend to force guests to occupy a table they might not necessarily like. As a guest, you need to have a feeling you're welcome. In general, food is alright, however, when you're taking a burger, try to let them know that you want a fresh bun, otherwise you're stuck with the older. I do occasionally go and bring a friend so you might try as well. This will help them improve."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3Z29fbGVBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"Food is decent, especially the ones from the menu. The main attraction of this place is the heathy salad bowls - however, they have reduced the options and items to be included in the body's since the time it was first introduced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaE9qeE5BEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"good vibes and friendly staff! food here is really good as well, will recommend !!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOE03X1NnEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",2,"OK. So the redeux is nice.  It looks nice and the menu is better.
Margarita tasted like pure juice and sour which was a bummer.

As for the food, I think they are missing the best point of having a SW US or Mexican menu:  You only have to stock 10-15 ingredients to make DOZENS of
different southern dishes!!!

My suggestion, and I mean this with best intentions.
Offer plain everything in the menu, then make proteins add-ons.  You are punishing vegetarians by charging full price to remove the meat.  Or even punishing anyone that isn't in the mood for a particular protein.
Adding a surcharge to change proteins is not cool.  2 bucks extra to sub prawn for chicken is kinda crazy.
Go basic + add-ons is my best suggestion.

Best of luck to you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMlk2aTlRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,Tasty food but there was a small dead cockroach in my mocktail. Ruined an otherwise tasty lunch.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2N2FQTjZRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",3,"The service was ok. However, the food was pretty low quality. I had a 50% off voucher and I still felt it was overpriced for what it was. After reading the other reviewers maybe I should not have ordered the steak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaDcyU3l3RRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,"Really nice place with nice ambience. The staff there are very friendly and professional as well! Definitely a good hidden corner in ntu for a getaway from campus life to enjoy some fine dining. Food is nice as well, love the jalapeño poppers!!! Rare to see such a dish and it was done superbly well. Will highly recommend to check out this place! Do try the wagyu burger as well, and the lava cake and pecan pie are off the charts."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eXJyOERBEAE,"PEN & INC, NTU",5,Recently reopened with a new menu. The $14 set lunch is a good deal. One of the only places in NTU to have food with service other than Cosmo restaurant.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNXzQtTnVRRRAB,"PEN & INC, NTU",1,If you go at peak hours be ready to wait for an hour for your food and when it arrives it might not even be what you ordered. They clearly need to hire more staff.

On an average it costs about 4-5SGD for a base +2 add ons with a salad sauce on a bed of lettuce. It’s worth visiting multiple times.

Proteins include tofu (2 types), chickpeas and veggies cover broccoli, corn, cucumber and tomato etc.

It’s handy for quick bites or takeaway!"

Other vegs like french beans, egg plants will be good too. Just a suggestion."

Just wish it was in a more accessible location ❤️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdE1DV1ZBEAE,The Crowded Bowl,5,Very clean and hygienic. Staff know the ingredients of all the items on the menu. So it's easy for vegans to make good choice of their salad bowl. Very good pricing too. Love the options in tofu.

The $4.50 option comes with 1 main + 2 sides, which the main are all carbs (Fusilli pasta, olive rice, potato). I asked if I could swap the main with some other veggies, but the answer was no from a staff in the evening (with some impatience attitude, probably tired throughout the day, let's give chance?) Feel like the swapping of main with veggie should be accepted and they should be more flexible. Anyway, the scrambled egg was super delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMi0tYkl3EAE,The Crowded Bowl,5,"I LOVE THIS. Wholesome comfort food. And I'm so disappointed they don't deliver further or offer their own delivery because the NTU campus is so far in. I'm obsessed with the cheese pasta, seaweed tofu and scrambled eggs 😍"

The purple rice in the yogurt can't bite the yogurt. The taste of yogurt is really too cheap. Buying drinks is so unprofessional. It's better to focus on selling hot pot drinks. More and more fans may spend a lot of money to eat what you want to eat. At least 15-20 can't run away. The package seems to be priced in the early ten dollars, but it is only enough to stuff your teeth. If you like fatty beef noodles or something, you can also update the staff. The frequency of replacement is a bit too high. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is slightly lower. The taste is not enough. The price is better. The taste is cheaper.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGNINzRnRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,It should be called as heart attack pasta as pasta was very very oily and cheeze on the top makes it scarier to eat. Prices definitely are not student friendly. This pasta is a health risk and and costly for the pocket.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c0pHM3lBRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,price is a little steep for food in a school establishment but overall decent baked pasta. would be great if there were a bit more ingredients :”) coffee was good though!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NlpuSFJBEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",4,"Although abit on the pricey side (could do w abit more quantity), their baked pasta is one of the best ones you can find in school!! really friendly staff too :D"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOEtmOU93EAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Don't buy the 5-star reviews you see here. This restaurant is absolute trash -  as I'm sure you can see from the countless other 1/2-star posts. Food portion is not worth it for the price of the meal when you can get something of higher quality and quantity from Pasta Express nearby. Heck it, I think even the food courts are better. Although I have to say the 1-star mainly comes from the extremely rude Chinese uncle who prepares the food here. Has absolutely no patience with customers and speaks rudely."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUw3cUlnEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",2,"Pretty shocked to see the rest of reviews right before I started digging in. I got the Chicken Tikka Pasta. On first sight looks pretty good, but the taste really isn't all that. Pretty oily inside as well. Agree with the reviews that the portion and quality doesn't justify the price ($9.42 with GST) Who even charges GST in the school though actually. Don't think I'll come again unless they shape up.

Edit: Original review was a week ago. Please take note of the 5 star reviews here, very fishy. Might be fake ones. How the hell is it value for money when someone else paid 8 dollars for 6 meatballs?"

Price may not be so student friendly.  But at this point of time, there is a overall hike in food price for Singapore.  I am glad they didnt compromise on the quality."

All the best to zitimamas team"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUpiNVdBEAE,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Food reminds me of airplane food. It was a unpleasant experience.

Edit: original post from 1 week ago. Shocked to see that there are 5 stars review. Those must be fake. The food is expensive and it does not taste good. Furthermore, the service is bad. When I am there for the first time, I did not notice that I have to order online and I stood there for a long time and the staff simply ignore you. The food is oily, the croissant I had was cold. Please try for yourself to find out the truth."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbUtYeW93RRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"As others have said, the quality of the food did not match up to the high
price (about $9). The pasta was inconsistently cooked. If you have a pasta craving within this area, I think Pasta Express or Tea Party are better choices.

EDIT: It seems that there are many 5-star reviews posted recently—make of that what you will."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbU5iSHZnRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",1,"Quite overpriced for a school establishment. Quality does not justify the price.

Edit: All the 5-star reviews appearing all within a span of a few hours last week just after the few 1 star reviews seems abit sus. Suspect these be fake/employee accounts manipulating the review score - Polarising reviews of 5stars vs 1 stars abit of a give away. (I hope not, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt here). For the record I ate their chicken tikka and it wasn't great - I dont know what those people are talking about. Unless there was a significant improvement over such as short time. No hard feelings but I sincerely hope that the owners take a hard look at their business model and really consider the criticism of the lower reviews. You guys just opened, there is still time to improve things. It'll be a waste of such potential especially with a different dining concept. All the best!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLUxHTWxRRRAB,"ZITIMAMA'S, NTU",5,Decent food at affordable rates. A neat place for vegetarians too.

Edit: Management should improve on customer service (polite to customers and not ignoring them) and the food served instead of engaging fake accounts to boost the score. This will increase the value of the experience and attract more customers to come back again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXR1WUJREAE,KFC NTU,1,"Ridiculously slow. Management too cheap to employ the necessary staff. It's one person at the cashier, one person cooking and one person wandering around. Have to wait half an hour for ""fast food"". Buy KFC and join behind a queue of 20 people waiting for their food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeHItRjFRRRAB,KFC NTU,2,"Zingerito okok only lah. Not cheesy enough. Service still as slow as ever.

Standard KFC food. Food generally is ok but the waiting for your food to come need to take quite some time. Not sure are they lacking staff or what...
The meal I had anyway is so freaking full lol. Only thing to improve is service I guess."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbXZYVTFnRRAB,KFC NTU,1,"The standard of food here is simply unacceptable. I’ve been here multiple times in the morning, each time with the ludicrous hope that it will be better than the previous time. The porridge is so watery it feels like you’re drinking salted rice water. There were literally only 1.5 pieces of chicken in my bowl, which itself was only 2/3 full. I have never had such an atrocious experience in other KFCs before - please close this outlet down as it is a disgrace to the brand name."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlckpXZ21BRRAB,KFC NTU,1,If you like your food served AN HOUR after your ordering. This is your first choice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc01YcnFRRRAB,KFC NTU,1,"Come in 45mins  to 60 mins prior to your meal time. Order taking at counter slow, order peeping  is extremely slow as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOU1tSnpBRRAB,KFC NTU,3,"I came here during lunch time... I tell you guys, the queue is darn long... There are only 2 workers working, 1 at counter, 1 inside the kitchen.. orders are moving at snail pace... 40 minutes to get to my order... They could only pack 1 order every 4 minutes... So please order online prior to coming down to save time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeHZqbGN3EAE,KFC NTU,1,"Welcome to the WORST KFC outlet in Singapore! There is only one famous female staff that is serving and collecting payment at the same time. And you always have to wait for them to fry a new batch of chickens which takes 15 mins. The chickens are literally waiting for you to appear before they drown in the oil. There was once we waited for 45 mins for them to fry 3 batches of chickens. Mine came at the third batches. NTU KFC always doesn't have new menu like the others KFC. They do not have BBQ crunch chickens!
Also most of the GREAT promo codes that KFC offers doesn't include NTU KFC. And at night they only have chickens, no burgers. Good luck to the next batch of NTU students. Have fun camping in KFC for 1 hour!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMHI3QWdBRRAB,KFC NTU,2,"It's crowded, seasonal items are often out of stock, long waiting time and sometimes the fries or the chicken are cold and soft. I'm not a big fan of fast food, but this KFC is surely not the best out there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbXB2Z0ZnEAE,KFC NTU,4,A great fast food option on campus. However some items are not available and there is no discounted price for students.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dmN2cE53EAE,KFC NTU,1,"Ordered a BBQ pocket meal, and a zinger box with a choice of chicken for take-away.

First thing, the BBW pocket was missing, just the fries and drinks. The zinger box was fine, it had everything.

Second, the chicken i asked for was original, but the one in the box was crispy.

Third, the chicken and zinger burger was dry.

The staff were not focused at all on what they were doing. I had to remind them for the drinks that came with the meal and the box.

Anyone who wants to go should probably triple check their orders, especially for drinks and every item they ordered.

Their only saving grace was the kind uncle that gives out encouragement notes to the students."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NEtxOVZBEAE,KFC NTU,4,Hits and misses here. Wait can be long during peak hours and they have a tendency to mess up are customised orders (even simple things like change of drinks). Clearing up the kfc cafe area will allow for more seating area. All these are made up for by the fantastic uncle who gives out sticky notes wishing students all the best for their study.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ODhia0d3EAE,KFC NTU,2,"While the seating area is air-conditioned, the queues are usually very long during lunch and dinner. Service is often slow thanks to low number of staffs and a lack of self-ordering machines (Sometimes there is only 1 staff at the counter, who has to collect money and pick up the food/drink items all by himself/herself.) Items in this branch are often out of stock, and there is no indication of items running out. Hence it is annoying when I realise my desired item is out of stock after queuing for more than 15 minutes. (In McDonald's, out of stock items are indicated on the menu screen and blocked on the self-ordering machines.)

Update (07 Sep 2018): There are 2 self-ordering machines at the entrance now, but they only accept card payment. When I was there, nobody was using the self-ordering machines and there were more than 10 people queuing at the counter. I ordered through the self-ordering machine and surprisingly I received my food within 5 minutes, while the queue at the counter didn't seem to move at all. (There were only 2 poor staffs manning the counter and preparing the orders.)"

So what is the significance of my packing? The ordering machine is also broken. The production speed is also very slow, and even on weekends, there are many people waiting for meals.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazllZUVnEAE,McDonald's,1,"Worst experience ever. I placed the order at 18:09 and now it is 18:58 and I finally get my food after times and times inquiries. It seems that my order was missing in McDonald’s system.
The funny thing is that the aunties at the counter just asked me to buy food at other stalls even though I had paid in McDonald’s. They said they were busy and no one tried to get my food ready. Then I requested to get refund and gave up the food. But they just refused and said how can I get a refund after I paid the money. (Totally wired logic)
Luckily, I am not in a hurry to do something today, and another auntie finally stood up, collected my food and beverage, and gave them to me (the food in my order is just ordinary ones, why took so long to prepare). But who wants to waste time on these tiny things, right?

We almost couldn’t receive our burgers because of their lack of understanding and bad service!!!!! They even looks like that they don’t believe in us at the end even if we show them the receipt of visa card(also the message) Surely, we deserves a compensation!

For some strange reason we couldn’t find the Happy Meal as a selection, I’m not sure if it’s because it’s on NTU campus? The line moved relatively fast but it still took us 20-25 minutes to get our order as there were tons of people."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3LWFfRFBBEAE,McDonald's,3,The line is simply always too long here. They have an efficient ordering and collecting system so things move. Avoid peak lunch hours. Staff is nice and keep things moving along as fast as possible. Have occasionally had bad food here though. Especially the fries which is a shame because McDonald’s fries are usually so good. And I believe prices are slightly lower because it’s an educational campus.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3BMb3hBRRAB,McDonald's,5,Clean and spacious. The kiosk machine was operating with a enough distance during this COVID sensitive time.

It’s was a good cut of meat, cooked to the degree I wanted… yumz!! Black pepper sauce was pretty good. It’s comes with 2 side dishes. Overall value for money, $11 per plate and I enjoyed the steak. Easily accessible by private transport and the multi storey carpark is just beside the coffeeshop so no worries about getting caught in the rain."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla3F2YWFREAE,The Chef's Place,4,Ordered their chicken wings with waiting for our dinner to arrive. Their chicken wings were very tasty and crispy.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcXZMOUh3EAE,The Chef's Place,5,"Pretty large portion for the price. Ordered multiple times and quite like the food. Generally prefer their grilled options to their fried options, and some of my favourites are Grilled Dory, Chicken Chop & Fish & Chips. For sides their curly fries, fresh salad and mac & cheese are pretty good imo. Portion for pastas is kinda small, so I wouldn't go for them."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM2VybkhBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"Nice hot and spicy. Take mild and try. Add the egg as it helps to lower the spice. Dun try to be superman on your first try.

This shop do help to separate those items that can or should be tried. A different take
Spice level linger so try to go easy. Very solar to the ones I eaten in most part of china when I was oversea.
."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NU9xeWVnEAE,A Hot Hideout,3,Really oily but the 麻辣was really there. You have to wait for quite some time for your food (we waited 30min~). Pricing is by grams so it’ll be the same price regardless of meat/vegetables. Ngl the price was a bit more $$ compared to other places… Milk tea was a bit too sweet but provides a good relief after the spice👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM0lxekFnEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"6 Jun '22:
Return visit so I could try their mala soup version. I had it medium spiciness and it was excellent. Almost addictive. More la and less ma, which I find a deviation of original mantra of Sichuan cuisine.
Nonetheless, it was excellent meal.

5 Jun '22:
Had a hard time trying to find the place. This hideout had both indoor (air con) and outdoor. Good vibes and cosy environment.
A huge variety to choose from.
Ordered both the less- and medium- spicy levels. The medium spicy level has a good kick and numbness to it.
The must-haves are potato, lotus root, beancurd skin, cuttlefish balls and whole fish. They have other proteins such as chicken and pork but they do not label them.
Ask for the reward card which they give 1 stamp for every $15 spent.
Free parking after 6pm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLTlDLTRnRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"I love how they deep fried the potato slices and scrambled the eggs. For someone that cannot really take spice, xiao la was a little too spicy for me… but it was worth it. It was very fragrant instead of just spicy. POTATOES & EGGS are a MUST order.
For this bowl, it was $30."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLXQ2T3dRRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"So i am here quite regularly. The mala is spot on. Small spicy is plenty good enough for me
Today try set lunch where they get random stuff for you. Good bowl of stuff and i fully enjoyed it.
Fav mala in Singapore. Go for the fish, potato, chicken, pork, beef, vege, eggs, potatoes, lotus etc etc. All good. Maggie mee must take.
Also sell ice-cream so you can cool your mouth after."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdzZldm5RRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"Second time eating here due to long queues since the start of the semester. Came down once we heard that the opening hours are extended to Saturdays as well(used to be closed on Saturdays).

Soup is nice, Potatoes , fish and luncheon meat etc. are fried separately.

Very clean environment, tissue box one every table. Choice of indoor(air conditioned) or outdoor seating. You will not end up with the mala smell on your clothes even if you sit inside for more than one hour.

Price is higher than most mala hotpot outside, but definitely worth it for the environment, service and quality of food.
Do join their telegram channel for special promotions. There is currently membership for discount and freebies.

Very crowded during school days, lunch/dinner hours. Queue can be very long, only one group will be able to pick the food at a time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjh1UDV3RRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,very good mala xiang guo.  luv the scrambled eggs n fried potato. the Thai milk tea is delicious too. a must try for mala lovers
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtei1fd1N3EAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"Unique mala experience. Mala collagen soup was unique, tho less spicy that the usual mala stall so do get da la at least if you are a spice lover. Dry mala was good, especially with Maggie noodles inside. Must try the potatos, luncheon meat, lotus root and fish which are deep fried before adding into dry or soup bowl. Eggs are scrambled to perfection and supper yummy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDZIWjVnRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"(15th June '22, ~5.45pm)
It's the best dried mala hotpot I've ever tasted in SG!! The spice is out of this world I'd say! For this 2nd visit, we increased our portion up to Abt $65 for the 2 of us, with the usual stuff we love. Spiciness still remain at small which is just the right amount for us to enjoy.

They offer to separate the fried stuff such as luncheon meat, fish and potato (sliced and fried into chips). You won't regret just DO IT. Add a buncha eggs to get them scrambled and watery down onto your bowl. Also preferred the smaller noodles while the sauce dances intensely ard them. Slurp carefully! The Thai milk tea is a must-have. THICK is the word. Add a little bit of water as it's Abit too sweet for me.

Pretty nice of u guys to include extra ingredients such as fried fish in our pot during our 1st visit. Will be back for more cravings!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z09iM1VnEAE,A Hot Hideout,2,"They deep dry the potatoes and lotus roots, which makes the dish really good. It smells amazing and I can't wait to dig in from the takeaway box.

HOWEVER, usually good things come with certain level of screwed ups right. That's the case for me. I ordered a mala soup take away and I was given a dry mala instead. When I approached the counter they told me no more soup available. Perhaps they can let me know earlier.

Also during dinner time it is better not to come later than 7pm to avoid the same disappointment and the long waiting hours. Yep, I waited for 1 hour for the take away."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaHBHdFlBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"honestly the best mala i’ve had in singapore, and the way they fry the eggs, potatoes, and lotus root is amazing~

overall an excellent spot for a nice lunch/dinner with friends, and i’ll definitely be visiting more too!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldjgzX05nEAE,A Hot Hideout,4,"this place is highly raved and recommended by my cousin who studied at ntu! it was my first time having soupy mala xiang guo and i must say that im quite impressed! the scrambled eggs and fried potato/lotus root made the meal a surprisingly unique one, except the fact that it wasn’t numbing at all which a typical mxg should be? hence one star off fr that inconsistency. that aside, everything was fairly good and i’ll probably return again when craving hits!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGVlc2dBRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,who knew scrambled eggs and potato crisps would go so well with malatang? this is a bowl that i’ll remember for a while to come; terrible location putting me off but i hope to come back again at some point in the future
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d2FLOEtBEAE,A Hot Hideout,1,"mala taste ok, waited one full hour for our food, and we realized that most of our ingredients amount got cut! and some ingredients we took were missing! we paid $30 for one small bowl! unacceptable!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dXJfS19nRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"Xiao la is too spicy for me!!!! If i ever go back, i'll totally request for extra extra xiao la, and if it's not possible maybe i'll try their soup version hahaha. But IMHO best best mala xiang guo i've ever tasted!!!! Compulsory topping: EGGS (best cos they scrambled it OMG BEST) and whole fish. I wish it's not too far away from the city cos it takes 1.5 hours to reach NTU sia"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHZ2RXc3JBRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,Impressive and interesting mala collagen soup! Thai Green Milk Tea is good too (forgot to take picture) Will be back again :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NFp2SWx3RRAB,A Hot Hideout,4,"After watching the review of a food vlogger we decided to try.

They go by weight and it's not the cheapest.  If you want to really get your money's worth, just take all meat, seafood and mushroom. Forget anything green.

None of the food is labelled so, choosing the meat is just a matter of fatty or lean.

They are very responsive on the telegram chat so just check with them for any queries.

Ideally, start your meal no later than 6.30 pm.  The queue gets out of control towards the night. We stepped in at 6pm and we were eating in less than 15 minutes.

The spice level of ""low"" is equal to ""Wei la"" outside.

The fried potato, is no different from potato chips, nothing really amazing, maybe potato chips are cheaper.

The fried lotus root was interesting. Since we do not find the fried lotus root chips outside easily, it is worth a return trip. Our nitpick is, they just fry the items without seasoning, no Cajun powder no salt n pepper. (OK maybe the dory had salt)  perhaps my expectation were shaped by LokLok and therefore too high.

I would really have preferred if they deep fried then somehow integrated the mala sauce with the fried items, maybe offer a dip. Maybe I am too influenced by loklok.

The scrambled eggs are just scrambled eggs without any seasoning.

Every other item was typical of a Mala shop. Either you agree with the taste or disagree. I agree with the taste.

The green and brown drink is Thai milk tea. The green one seems to be Thai milk tea with jasmine green tea. They are not really strong brew, but worth the $2.50 price tag. Probably one of the cheapest Thai milk tea.

There is a strange smell on the tray, but small matter, just put it away.

Unlike many other eating places in NTU there is no student price for flashing your student card here.

This place is not worth a detour. It is worth trying if you are in the area or you drive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDZmTVdnEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"A Hot Hideout @ NTU
Yummy yummy mala selling here!  The collagen soup is delicious too! Very different with the mala in other parts of Singapore! Must try! Highly recommended! I wish I could add six stars 👍👍👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjl1OTh3RRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"love their scrambled egg and fried potato, mala was not too oily and flavour was really good, would eat again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMGY2ekR3EAE,A Hot Hideout,5,Really one of my favourite mala tang out there!!!! The only thing is tat BOTH outlet is so far away frm me…
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ3FhVFFBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"The mala here is definitely one of the best and cheaper ones I have had.

They offer ingredients that one would normally not find in other mala stalls but still manage to blend them seamlessly into the dish. I would highly recommend the eggs, which they serve scrambled on top of the dish. Another unique point would be how they deep-fry certain ingredients (best of which are the potatoes, lotus root, and fish) which add an extra layer of texture and taste. I find the dry version to be the better style of their mala, but this is not to discount the soup version, which is rather flavourful as well. Though do expect to wait around 15 - 25 minutes, which feels rather acceptable to me considering the level of preparation.

The price is based off the weight of the ingredients, irregardless of whether they are meat or vegetable. Compared to other mala stalls, the price here is considerably cheaper and you can expect to spend around S$8 - 10 per person for a filling portion.

The store has a great ambience as well with a cozy indoor setting and also a cool outdoor seating overlooking a part of the campus. Some seats to wait at is also provided along the corridor to the store which is an added bonus.

I end with their service, which is mainly what prompted me to write this review. The staff there have always been friendly and helpful in all my visits. I would like to highlight a recent visit when they unfortunately made a mistake in the order. As we only noticed later when the store was about to close, we were not able to ask for the missing ingredients. However, my friend was contacted by an employee of the store who was very apologetic and offered a discount off our next order. The responsibility and service shown by the staff through this action definitely reinforced the consistency in their service.

All in all, definitely worth the trip into NTU!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOGRLWTNBRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"11/10 Food, the only place where getting seafood with your mala is actually a smart decision. Winning free ice cream for the party feels pretty good too. Come early / late to avoid the queue!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNnRQUXl3RRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,Beverage stall opened by young entrepreneurs. Worth a support! They accept paynow. They offer rare drinks like butterfly pea but the highlight is the Thai iced milk tea with a hinge of coconut taste. According to them their specialty is their coconut coffee.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbi0zRG5nRRAB,A Hot Hideout,5,"Interesting selection of drinks: dark chocolate milk, butterfly pea tea with lemon, rose tea, your classic coffees, etc. Recently opened! Happy to have a bit more variety in this food market. Owner is very friendly!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdWYyVURBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,Rlly love love love the collagen mala soup here! Makes the spice less painful and the soup way more drinkable! They deep fry their potatos and fish to give that crunch and serve eggs in a fluffy soft scramble on top. Super love!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcGRUTFNREAE,A Hot Hideout,5,Definitely get the fish for your choice of meat because they'll fry it really nicely for you! (Potato and lotus root as well) Scrambled egg is very fluffy too :)

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX2EyaFp3EAE,A Hot Hideout,5,By far one of the best mala I’ve ever had. The crispy potatoes are to die for and the drinks are a perfect pairing for the spicy meal.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdWN1TDhnRRAB,A Hot Hideout,1,"Have been here a few times but I feel the need to review my latest visit. We had to wait for almost an hour (see photo attached). There was Raydy-o silence from the restaurant's Instagram despite the numerous tags. And when the food arrived, the ingredients in the soup were barely cooked. One can only wonder how a dish that took close to an hour to prepare could somehow arrive undercooked. Did the bowl take a detour through Antarctica? My friends and I soldiered through because we did not want our stomachs to be held hostage for another 60mins. After the ""meal"", we let the cashier know about the state of the food. The cashier could only apologise. Having been wronged in time and in taste, I feel the customer service, like the dish, was undercooked."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0ptck1BEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"Only thai milk tea is left, cafe latte not i. Stock already"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDZmZEhBEAE,A Hot Hideout,5,"interior design looks dope, foods great too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMF9HTExREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Came on weekday evening.
No queue. But most table are under reserve.

Service ok. Pro-active but not flexible.

Food Nice. However their bake potato no longer the same I use to taste before. 🙃

Garlic bread soggy — 🫤

Will recommend to make reservation prior to it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXblkyMDhRRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Childhood family restaurant! Back to enjoy a nice dinner. The western menu still relatively the same and taste delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXBpQlJnEAE,Jack's Place,4,"A set meal of Grilled Barramundi with Hollandaise Sauce, Cream of Shiitake Mushroom and Mango Mousse Sliced Cake with Earl Grey Tea fills the hungry belly 😋
If you're a small eater, please bring your family to savor the delicious western meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncEltdHRnRRAB,Jack's Place,4,"A casual dining restaurant with reasonable pricing. The steak is good and comes with seasonal promotion most of the time. One may top up to a set to make it a complete meal. And there’s a wide range of different types of coffee that you can upgrade, which I personally love the mocha.

The lunch set meal comes with a soup with a garlic bread, a main, a dessert and a cup of coffee/tea, which can all be upgraded at a small cost. Lately there’s also a one for one promotion during weekdays lunch.

With the membership sign up, you may redeemed points which is converted to cash rewards, plus other benefits, such as birthday e-voucher."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMEkzWVdnEAE,Jack's Place,5,Average service as waiters got our orders wrong but the food was amazing as always.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxaDh1aTFBRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"Had the T bone set for 2.. the waiting time was definitely not 30min as stated. It took close to an hr for the meat to be served. Sides were generous and we were honestly already full from them while waiting for the main.
Sides (potatoes & macncheese) were great but the T bone was extremely tough and not tasty at all.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eU5mNjRRRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"Curly fries was over salty. Mixed lamb n fish presentation was lacklustre, piece of fish was small, overall taste still alright. Beef stew and rice tasted nice. Overall good enough for a quick business lunch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOVByaWxRRRAB,Jack's Place,2,"I was disappointed with the quality served at Jurong Safra branch. Only 3 service crews on that day, beside the slow service, the food quality was bad, steak was tough, lobster was over cooked and not fresh.
These 2 stars was given for the 3 service crews as they are trying their best to serve everyone.
I have pics to contribute as I really have no mood by the time food we're served 😟"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ2JXejhnRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"The red meat plate are good for affordable price. The entries and the desserts so so (rather close to company' cantine than French basic pâtisseries from street' corner).   For entries and desserts, rather feel like eating ibis budget hotel than novotel for those who know. Mains really worse it however. So overall as it is cheap it's OK for quick lunch or dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb3RxdjlBRRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Always hearty meals here at the good ol' Jack's Place! Even kid's meals are pretty full sized! The familiar western selections, and that potato with skin topped with a heapful of sour cream, bacon bits and spring onions! We were there to celebrate the boys birthday and service was impeccable, constantly checking if everything was fine! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2V1aGR3EAE,Jack's Place,1,"Very bad customer service, eating the main course half way they suddenly serve the desert and clear my plate as the food not finish, ask for a extra chair to put my baby stuff and bag and the staff there keep saying u block the way here and there, I already push the chair very near to my table, I'm there with my family to spend and have our nice dinner, not asking for your staff to treat us like that. Food potion is getting lesser and lesser and price is getting higher and higher. Never think about go back again as there are many other choices out there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdnNtb0NnEAE,Jack's Place,1,"Google should allow zero stars because that's how bad my experience was today. I walked in around 3pm and no one bothered to attend to me. Even though there was only 5 tables occupied while staff was just walking around.

After finally being shown to a table, I asked what was the soup of the day. But the staff did not know and said he will check. Was given a QR code to make my order. But it did not work saying the table was closed. Asked one staff for assistance. Was given an abrupt ""wait ah"". After awhile, asked another staff, given same response. I was finally then given a new qr code. Still no one told me what the soup of the day was.

15mins have since passed since I walked in. I am frankly very disappointed with how far the service standards of Jack's Place have fallen. I have been going to Jack's Place since Yen Sen Building in Orchard Road. I would have fully understood if it was crowded but it was the middle of the day, there were enough staff around and the restaurant was not even 1/3 full.

After 20mins, my appetite was gone and I left."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NXZQenp3RRAB,Jack's Place,3,"Overall a nice place for a family meal with a wide selection of dishes. The chocolate brownie was great but might be a bit too sweet. Had the slipper lobster aglio olio, the aglio olio was spicy and taste good but the lobster (crayfish) was tasteless and dry. Waiter wasn’t rude per se but is listless and unenthusiastic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdXF2amlnRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Reasonably priced family restaurant with western and local food. Good variety and set meals are value for money. Steak and baked potato is their regular favourites. Grill baramundi in the flavours of the sea is a good seasonal option. New staff Stephy is attentive. Other new service staff does well too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aTlUQTNnRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Their offers are pretty good.
Love their potato with sour cream, chives and bacon bits. Pro tip, you can ask for seconds."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cnFlM2VnEAE,Jack's Place,3,Celebrate family birthday here. Use GE voucher for Safra Jurong West branch. Average customer service as no smiles but service is prompt and businesslike. Food presentation can be improved as it can be better than Collins.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpZ1BIZFNBEAE,Jack's Place,3,"Nice ambience. Food is average. Ordered breaded fish and chips, and the grilled chicken set. Fish is not fresh, the pineapple that comes with the chicken tasted spoilt. If you are looking at value for money, come during lunch for the set lunch menu. Service was ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbHNxdEpREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Value for money set western food, kids friendly with kids menu. Place is wheelchair accessible. Also available are premium steaks, lobsters, escargo and wine. For healthy choice, salads are available. Soft music plays in the background, no live band."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXQyWVVnEAE,Jack's Place,5,Book in advance to minimise waiting time. Food was good although the place was slightly understaffed. Will recommend this outlet if you're a safra member.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeVB6OTNBRRAB,Jack's Place,1,"Overpriced and under delivered. I asked to take away a $6 soup and $6 chicken wings. The soup came in a small plastic container and it was only half full. And the 4 pc chicken wings was basically 2 wings and 2 drumsticks. If you’re are going to charge so much at least have the quantity to match. Or taste good. If I can get the same food from a coffee shop western shop, why would anyone come and eat here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOTlmRnRnRRAB,Jack's Place,1,"Dining ambience is satisfactory and food is so so compared to other Jack's Place outlet.

The reason I gave it a one star review is the service level, questions unanswered by a young female wait staff.

Hope to see some improvement on service level.

Thank you"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOUkyWVhBEAE,Jack's Place,3,Jacks Place used to be a great Steak Restaurant in the 90's..till some time in 2000's.(Their outlet in Killiney Rd was very good).Then they stopped serving Pork products in their dishes..& Fillet Mignon Sizzler steak which had Crispy Bacon on it was revamped wth other items. Further..their service attention to customers had waned also..& Red Wine was served chilled..thus ruining its taste. Lastly like most Western food outlets in Singapore  they hardly have any hot vegetarian main dish offerings.. unlike in North America etc (where there are atleast 5-6 items to choose). Overall an average Restaurant wth 5 star prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4cDR6MWV3EAE,Jack's Place,4,Had Barramundi with Otah & curry sauce under national dy promotion. Fish is fresh and juicy but pity the otah wasnt much thinner then in menu. It comes in set meal if you are willing to top up $6.80 to get a soup and dessert.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc2NpWmJnEAE,Jack's Place,3,Food was average. 4 of us had their steaks..all i have to say is you better have  sharks teeth n jaw to chew that meat. Felt like i was fighting the animal while eating it. Even toigh meat can be prepared to be relatively soft. Simoly tgrowing a piece of meat on the frying pan does not make it a steak.. Just my oppinion. Service and ambionce was nice though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOFBYWjl3RRAB,Jack's Place,1,"Had food poisoning after having the the lobster and chicken combo, with the lobster soup. You might want to look into that."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld19icWVBEAE,Jack's Place,5,Reasonable price western food and comfortable environment. Will go back there again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdk1UaUlREAE,Jack's Place,3,"Really disappointed in their red velvet cake. 3 years ago, we ordered a full 500g red velvet cake and we were served a majestic 3 layered red velvet masterpiece. This time we ordered a whole 500g red velvet again but it was 2 layer of red and 1 layer of cream, and the whole red velvet was covered with coconut shavings, horrible try at a new recipe.

Aside from the unfortunate red velvet incident, service and food quality still remains as great! We enjoyed ourselves."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bW9UV3hBRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"Nice good food but not enough ppl to serve, long waiting time to clear table and serve desserts despite multiple reminders... will go another branch not Safra Jurong"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMUppTFV3EAE,Jack's Place,3,"Food was average. Service is slow, but servers were friendly and helpful. Managed to change the potato to more salad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeElld1JBEAE,Jack's Place,3,"Almost two years since we last visited this place Service has dropped. Staff were rather unfriendly. Took super long time for the drinks (peach cooler, lychee cooler, longan coolers etc) to be served. Doesn’t make sense for simple drinks to take so long to be served. When it came, the peach cooler was very sweet. The aglio Olio was super super tough. Thankfully, the staff offered to do a replacement upon feedback."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOTVqMzFRRRAB,Jack's Place,3,"I went there in Valentine and ordered their Valentine special. The food is good and the portion is big for the price. Its worth it. But it a little bit crowded and the service is alittle slow, I think is due to the valentine day.
I waited for 15min before I get a table even through I booked a week earlier."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnLWFLZE93EAE,Jack's Place,3,"Taste is average. Service is okay. If not for the lunch menu, then not worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcXBTUTBnRRAB,Jack's Place,2,"They changed their menu. Beef quality seems to drop.  Latte was diluted.  Service level needs to improve.
Twice i visited and they put me in one of the corner seat and forget about me. When you raised your hand, the waiters and waitresses just never seems to notice you. Pretty sad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNTlfREtBEAE,Jack's Place,3,"The appetiser is a bit too much for 1 person, maybe they try to match the amount food to the price.. but I rather they reduce the price instead. The main course is alright but the rareness scale is a bit off to the rare side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MTRYdmZBEAE,Jack's Place,4,"Always love a Sunday dinner at this neighbourhood steakhouse 🥩 service is hit & miss depending on who’s serving you (I had a pleasant experience this visit, less the last). Most importantly food is good, so I’ll be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDhEdUtBEAE,Jack's Place,2,There is a lot of add in and option which made the price higher. The food is getting worse than before.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZy1mQlJREAE,Jack's Place,5,"Hi, I would like to commend the jack's place team at Jurong safra outlet for an excellent service provided during my dine. You really have a very impressive team of staff. We found a hair in one of our course meal - aglio olio ordered by my friend. whilst i ordered the chicken cutlet. But the team compensated with both our meals as they saw that there was a piece of chicken cutlet in the aglio olio. Thanks team for making our dining experience here an awesome one. Will definitely recommend coming here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM011WlZREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Quiet dining experience. Food was served quickly, however the drinks did not come with straws and have to request to be given."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1azctcklREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Quiet place, not crowded during weekday lunches, good for catch up"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d2RTVHVRRRAB,Jack's Place,3,Food is served quite quickly. Good service.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJclByYkNREAE,Jack's Place,5,"Celebrate Christmas here, the meal is delicious, the ambient is nice, the service is good.. Overall satisfied :D"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeHNTMkpREAE,Jack's Place,3,"Maybe because they were understaffed... I went there to dine for mother's day dinner with my mother. I reserved a table but they didn't seem to have my name on the reservation list? All the waiters were too busy to be flagged down. Clearing of plates was done when they happened to walk past the table, just the arm stretched in, take the plates and walk off. No asking "" Is it okay if I clear the table"". Had 2 items the waiters forgot to bring to us... which took a while for us to get them because the waiters were so hard to flag. In the end, we got some good service from the assistant manager."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMm9UaU5BEAE,Jack's Place,5,"Well a variety of delicacies to feast here. Though one may find it pretty expensive compared to other eateries, its worth the price one pays as the dishes are tasty and delightful. Its worth every penny spent. Friendly staff and a cosy atmosphere dwells in the dining area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5XzdDc293RRAB,Jack's Place,5,went during a Monday rainy evening as trying to avoid the crowds. food is good.  service is fine . was lucky as they were having half price promotion on combo grill . two adult with three children.  enjoyed. bill is about 90 dollar.  without promo should be around 130
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdDlpbUZ3EAE,Jack's Place,1,"Worst e dining experience. Ordered a main course. Waited 40 mins, the waiter come tell me it was not prepare. Multiple wrong food and beverage was serve.

Every food need to ask, then only will serve!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ODdiSi13RRAB,Jack's Place,4,Quiet place serving decent western food at affordable price. Attentive staffs.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGZxbnlRRRAB,Jack's Place,5,Not bad steak was pretty well done ☺️
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X1kyLWtRRRAB,Jack's Place,3,Food is ok. Prefer the outlet at West Coast (permanently closed) where staff were friendly and the food was better. The water melon juice was diluted. Maybe too much ice. Will try other outlet next time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHU3SU13EAE,Long John Silver's,5,"Went to LJS NTU at 7:30 and after ordering, the cashier informed us that some of the things we ordered were sold out and they offered to give us some freebies to make up for it. Thanks abang!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhb3ZuclJnEAE,Long John Silver's,2,"1. Very slow service
2. Sometimes closes before the stated time
3. If ordering during non-peak hours, the food can be soggy and not fresh

Highly recommend to wait if you see not more than one person in the queue."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LTRhZ0FREAE,Long John Silver's,3,"Standard fast food. Part of the Secret Society thats keeping LJS alive. Haha.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnek1mX1BREAE,Long John Silver's,2,"I ordered dory,and they had problems finding it,I guess... It's been 15 minutes and counting... I see some people have waited 20 minutes...
I think they really need to review practices or they'll be out of business soon"
