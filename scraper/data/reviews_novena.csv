不愉快的购物体验"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaVBMbzVBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Remember visiting this place when I was young, recently visited it again and looks like it has had some modern revamp.

Food is consistently good and their usual specials like the Peking duck and popiah skin are a must order. We ordered some other items which were pretty good too.

Service was up to par and staff was on hand to attend almost immediately."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdWRId2VREAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Very tasty chinese food. French bean(干扁四季豆)in particular was the best I have ever had. Also ordered their Zhenjiang Pork Rib (镇江排骨) and Poached Sliced Beef in Spicy Sauce (水煮牛肉) which were both very good as well. Overall a very enjoyable meal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aV9LT09nEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Had an enjoyable dining experience at this newly renovated outlet. Interesting and delicious dishes. Attentive service from the crew, with Emily leading the team."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNjRMdGZ3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"Haven't been there in years, and I'm glad they are still around. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer DIY popiah, as I don't remember them having it on their menu. We ordered a set to try. The portions were good for 2-3 persons, with 6 popiah skins. I wish they had provided more skins as they tend to break. The ingredients were great, very delicious and fresh. The garlic paste and chilli sauce both pack a punch, so you might want to go easy on them at first. I didn't see any dried shrimp nor fresh prawns, so I think this dish is suitable for vegetarians as well.
The ambiance was very nice, plus the courteous and friendly staff all made dining there a delightful experience. Well worth checking out if you're around the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeXVyQjFBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,I truly enjoyed the lunch here with family members whom we have not dine together for 2 years! Ordered the set for 10 paxs and portions were huge but satisfying.  The collagen barramundi dish is amazingly delicious.  We were very satisfied. Only drinks could be a little on the high side.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbW8yVGtnRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"Visited in September 2021 for a family dinner. Service was prompt despite the Saturday crowd, and our orders were served quickly. Food was also as my family likes it, spicy and hot. Would recommend for family dinners or casual gatherings.

(Many of the signature dishes are from Plaza Singapura's Lokkee,  which ceased operations a while ago)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa3JXVFl3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,My go to place for quality and comfort food. Standard remain consistent over the years. Love the fried rice as is full of wok hei. Special shout out to Candi for being such a bubbly and attentive server. Thanks for the wonderful dining experience and see you soon at Square 2!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aTZyYWlBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Great dining experience. Every dish was well executed and flavourful. Highly recommended to go with friends or family. Would definitely revisit.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOE9qUWxnRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"Restaurant has been around for years but revamped menu recently serving dishes fr  Lokkee. It’s lokkee pricing too . The fire cracker chicken is $30. New dishes has up pricing to be on the steep side . It’s chicken bits fried in salt , dried Chili , ginger, spring onions , Sichuan peppers.  The yellow yolk look alike is actually mango sauce .

Special call out to the barramundi fillet atop bed of vege and toufu in a collagen soup base .
Fish fillet was thick, fresh , $88 can feed 4 to 6 pax .

Xiao long Bao was till good , the dumplings in Chili oil was nice too ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ3ZHUzJRRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Great ambience and food, had the duck which is definitely their specialty, the lamb leg which did not taste like mutton at all  but if you're into that mutton taste maybe this isnt for you. Loved their eight treasures tea as well. The pork ribs were a little too sweet for my taste but if you like sweet bbt this is the dish for you. Also ordered the assorted vegetables and xiaolongbao and pan fried dumplings, which did not disappoint."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbk96ejRBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"My grandchildren got excited with the DIY popiah and the peking duck, hands on meal.

The restaurant also did a salt and pepper fry with the duck carcass so nothing was wasted. However, the peking duck crepes were dry, especially the top layer, perhaps due to poor packing for delivery. The popiah skin was ok and did not dry out like the crepes for the duck.

The dumplings were meaty and juicy. I also like the four season beans with minced meat. The fried noodle texture was a tad tough for my liking although the taste (seasoning) was spot on.

Overall, it was a very memorable delivered meal which we enjoyed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aV9MYTJBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Delicious food and excellent service! Will certainly come again!

The dishes such as Peking duck, mermaid fish, xiao long bao, rou kan salad and desserts are a must try! Very delicately prepared, intricate and mouth watering!

Service was excellent as well! Staff were attentive and approachable and Emily was great!

Thumbs up!"

always wanted to try LAO BEIJING when they are in velocity, this is our first time trying and needless to say, it was an amazing experience and get our craving for peking duck fulfilled! 😊 what i like about is that i can order half peking duck instead of other tunglok places that i can only order 1 full peking duck. - which allow me and my wife to enjoy not only peking duck but also other dishes 😊 now awaiting for our dessert Tempura Durian to be serve 💕"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnB5YWFBEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Lovely place for traditional family gathering. Service was great, food was even better. My mom and my uncle love all the dishes we've ordered!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dm9tT3dBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Lao Beijing moved from Velocity to Square 2. All the favourites in the menu still around.  The new place have more spacious seats. Service still good. Recommended items - Mermaid, bacon bal kwa with Sakad, salad Prawn with melon and walnut, egg white fried rice with convoy, fried French beans, black garlic xiao long bao and for dessert - Red bean pancake with ice cream."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc2ZLTzVnRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,The wagyu beef truffle Hor fun … is a must have . The meal was tasty . Also had the braised red Garoupa fish soup with pickled cabbage and chilli . Fish was fresh and soup was good and a tad spicy . Bakes bacon salad Delicious but pricy . Overall I would come back again . Staff was very friendly and ambience was welcoming .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMVBUeEl3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,3,"food tasted very average, definitely had better. super pricey and the portions were really small as well. the only good dishes were the xiao long bao and the la zhi ji but the rest were average
service was decent but didn’t feel like the meal was very worth it"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyek55dlVnEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Came for afternoon dimsum buffet. Self serve certain items while order ala carte for the rest. Time limit of 90 minutes per table
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM0pYdW1RRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Good tastes for original Beijing flavour cuisine. Spent S$200+ for 4 people. Xiao Long bao and guoti are also good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OFlXX2FnEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,The food is nice. The staffs are very responsive and helpful. Wonderful experience dining here
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X2Jtc2d3RRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Great when you need to catch a Chinese meal at Velocity, in Novena area. The beef noodle soup with tendon and brisket was flavorful. Brisket was tender (think it's slow-cooked?) and I usually don't like brisket but finished all of it. The noodle would be even better if the soup came steaming hot, an essential trait for Chinese style noodles."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dTZUNklnEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Excellent service with amazing food. Compliment to Aunty chun Hong, my daughter made the place messy and she was very nice to offer tissue and water for her."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdHJTT21nRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,The mermaid dish nice. Service crew can be abit over friendly by keep coming to your table to ask if you want to order when you are still waiting for friend to arrive.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtck1lMXh3RRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"go to spot for Peking duck! They also do the duck in other flavours such as the 椒盐鸭 which is a family favourite. Service could be more attentive, hard to get their attention"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OEpfN2lBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"Recently changed menu, realised they combined the some dishes from original menu with Lokkee which was recently closed down. Liked the wagyu beef horfun. Guo tie is ordinary. The scallion wrap with fish filling is good surprise. Free mango sago dessert from friendly captain, but unfortunately too sweet to my taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXanZPTkZREAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,3,Had the Hi Tea buffet. Menu variety for buffet was little. In general a nice spread but not as satisfying as it could be (no xiao long baos). Would recommend their ala carte menu instead.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNWVTcmR3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,The foods here delicious n good. The staffs polite n helpful. Peking duck is superb. Highly recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dlpxRHpBRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"Went Lao Beijing to celebrate my father’s birthday and was pleasantly surprised by the food quality. Despite the pricing is not that of a high-end Chinese restaurant, the food is definitely top notch. The Peking duck is flavourful and crispy, and the other dishes were also delicious too. Not forgetting the manager- Emily who has prompt and good service. She is efficient, polite and helpful. I will not hesitate to return for meals."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNGU3ZG9BRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Great service and the staff were very very good and accommodating to our request. Highly recommanded especially chun rong she was very very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NTdHckp3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,Good place for noodles and simple Chinese dishes. Beef noodles is pretty good with noodles having a good texture. Xiao Long Bao and some of the other snacks taste good. The recent afternoon tea ala carte buffet is pretty good too with a nice range of dim sum. Price for the buffet is reasonable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX3JTQmdnRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"Always a pleasure to dine here, dishes are delicious and service impeccable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOGIteF93RRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,It is always a good place to eat alone or with your friends and families. Dim Sum here is tasty and juicy~ A very good choice for Cantonese food lovers~

Great place for family meal and presentable for bringing guests."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeW9xVW1RRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,4,"This is our first visit in almost 2 years. What surprise us pleasantly was how their service has become more personable.  All the waitresses and managers always have a smile on their face when they approached our table and speak to our children. I have not had such a feeling for a long time and for a while gave up being served.  At the end of the day, there is restaurants with great food and limited service and there is restaurant with decent food with great service. I will certainly choose the latter."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbDlLblBnEAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,The mermaid collagen soup is rich in taste and  excellent. Must try .

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc3NpRHl3RRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,"We have lunch yesterday at this restaurant. We are happy with the variety of dishes available. The food portion is generous and the food tasted delicious. The service staff are friendly and served with a smile.

The services and the food quality exceeded our expectations and we will definitely return for lunch and dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTZiVm53RRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,3,"The bean paste noodle was miserly in portion though price had gone up. Not only was noodles dry and clumpy, the bean sauce was small in portion , hence making the noodles ""dry""."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2RhYVlREAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Extremely good service and very satisfied with the food. Very tasty and presented well! Perfect location to host family gathering and celebrations! Speed of serving the food and replenishing the tea is amazing as well. Highly recommended!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzVMWDZnRRAB,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,Had an excellent lunch at the newly revamped Lao Beijing. The service staff were very polite and attentive. The Peking Duck is even better than the version we had at the old place. Highly recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLU96M0d3EAE,Lao Beijing Square 2,5,The ambiance is always good even when there are lots of guests. Food has always been delicious. It’s interesting that the restaurant is bold to revamp its menus every now and then. Thank you for being my family’s favourite restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLXFIS1BnEAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"A simple yet delicious get together dinner with my cousins.
Service staff were polite and helpful. We were shown to our seats promptly upon checking in, and they even helped to change our utensils when we change over for dessert.
The new QR ordering is easy to use and our orders came in promptly.
The automated delivery train is fun and easy to use, thanks to the clear direction indicated.
The highlight is definitely the sweet and sour meat which came in with a grand appearance thanks to the dry ice effects."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbmZ6N0ZBEAE,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Came here for the dimsum buffet. Being a weekday, it was priced at $36.80 (4 diners, 1 diner eats free). The selection was good. However, the eating time is only 2 hours, so it was a bit rushed. The quality of food was normal, reasonable for the price. Good for large groups when u can't decide what to order but not good because of the time limit. Service was good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaVo2TThnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,3,"Fashioned after a tea house, this restaurant serves dim sum and Chinese dishes. A
Good variety of dim sum available but I think there are better dim sum out there. The best dish were the white bait fish in truffle oil and roast pork noodles. Congee was disappointing as it was bland. Spinach with 3 eggs lacked flavour. Pork ribs had more yam than meat! Egg tarts are bite sized, flaky and warm. We had booth seats which can sit 4-5 people comfortably. The dishes are served using the smart train belt which is quite efficient but not easy for children to handle.
Service was fast and attentive. Overall, a pleasant experience however the food quality not as good as expected."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtanBDSzlRRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,Our Tim sum place at novena but there aren’t many varieties for Dim Sum. Fried rice with shrimp was nice. Icy sweet & sour pork was interesting for the 1st time but meat was normal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXamIyalRBEAE,TungLok Teahouse,3,"It’s a decent place. Love the signature Cheong fun, crispy and succulent shrimps. The durian glutinous dessert is okay.
Fully automated using conveyance belt to deliver to you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDQtdlNREAE,TungLok Teahouse,4,"The place does a weekend high tea dim sum buffet which is pretty decent and good value. The buffet has a good range of dim sum and other Chinese dishes. Food quality wise, pretty good since this is after all part of Tung Lok. Service is efficient, and ordering is all automated. Prices seem reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMVBuT0pnEAE,TungLok Teahouse,1,"Quite a bad experience over there. Food was so-so nothing too impressive about. We went for the dim sum buffet menu and guess what har gao or shrimp dumpling is not in the dim sum buffet menu and have to ordered separately.

That’s not the worst, the steam fish come with a strong mud smell but they use large amount of garlic to cover the smell.

The atmosphere is not great even though they are located in a shopping mall the air con in the restaurant is high and there is no cooling feeling.

Lastly, the service. The service is not great at all, no one attended to the table service and our emptied plates are all piling up at the table and no one is here to clear the plates UNTIL when we are about to left the table.

Horrible experience definitely not going back again. There is so many more dim sum place better then them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bV9pS25RRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,"The hightea buffet is worth checking in. All
the food items are very tasty and couldn’t find any flaws to it. The dumplings with chilli & oil are exceptionally good! They have frozen ones available to purchase too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta01IbGV3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,4,Ala carte buffet dinner at reasonable prices. Staff service was good. Dishes delivered via conveyor belt system. Reducing much wait time. Ordering via online menu after scanning a QR code givevn by staff was also quick and simple.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOVpPWmlRRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"The food was fabulous. Also, the staff are honest and helpful. My friend dropped his credit card. They are guided us to conceign to collect the lost card. Thank you Emily and Li Zhen!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1X2JhdVRREAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"My 1st time here with my friend recommendation.

Food is pretty decent and quite a number of choices from Dim Sum to A la Carte buffet of Chinese food.

The promotion is 3+1 excluding drinks that is 1 for 1 promotion.  Reasonable prices and we spent less than $40/pax"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3BYVDF3RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"The high tea buffet is super value for money. You get delicious food with freshly made dim sum. The menu is periodically updated so you get new food items once in a while. Fried food is piping hot and on point, seasonings all well done. As it's a buffet, we also love that the quantities are perfect for tasting, just order a few more if you want! We're repeat customers and we'd continue coming!
Chilli crab sauce Lala, Thai sweet chilli sauce crispy tofu, stir fried beef are must orders."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyakpqUzN3RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,1,"20200816: VERY SNEAKY. Put a side dish say for u and at the end charge u in the bill.
It could have been a gd constant rating for such a top brand restaurant.

Quality of the food is good. Mid tier price range."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MVlDUUd3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"This is my first time here and I felt like I have stepped into an authentic Chinese Teahouse in Hong Kong. TungLok Teahouse @tunglokgroup is located at Square 2 which is nicely set against a backdrop of a busy Hong Kong Street. The concept is to re-create the convivial atmosphere where families can gather together while chatting over hearty dim sum delights.
.
TungLok Teahouse is also the first Chinese restaurant to launch the automated tray delivery system. Basically, once your order is ready, the food will arrive via the delivery track that is beside your table. You will pick up the food from the delivery track and you had to press the red button to have the tray return to the kitchen.

The menu features an array of exquisite handmade dim sum selections as well as Chinese favourites and Teochew cuisine"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NTdLcDBnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Food is generally good, the Bbq pork a bit expensive. Will come back to try the staff’s highly recommended dinner buffet"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Z1ltbVh3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,3,"The dimsum buffet was priced ($26/pax) reasonably for the quality of food and convenient location though lacked variety. Some hits and misses, the prawn wrapped in beancurd skin was probably the best item in menu. Siew Mai was average, a tad dry, shrimp dumpling was also tad dry and the dumpling in red oil wasn’t good. Chee chong fun, egg tarts and har gao were missing from menu. Saved by the better dessert and cheerful service staff. Overall experience was good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dzctaV9BRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,3,"Had the Dinner Dim Sum Buffet.

It comes with abalone, sharkfin and a few other dishes on top of their free flow dim sum dishes.

However, not all dishes are worth the order.

For instance, prawn paste chicken tasted bland and felt more like a KFC crispy chicken with very very subtle/non-existent praen flavors.

Their charsiew and chicken, which si their BBQ roast, weren't nice at all. It taste more like a microwaved dish that's dried and weirdly flavoured.

Carrot cake was just average.

Sliced fish (with pork?), wasnt very nice as well.

But that's most of their bad.

So what's good?
Sharkfin literally had sharkfin in it, abalone was nicely seasoned and done. Fried beancurd prawn paste was unique, crispy and flavourful.

Their pork chop with chef's sauce is great as well.
Their spicy vinegar wonton is very nice, in contrast with the typical dim sum stores that barely had any filling, TungLok had it filled with prawn filling and very flavourful sauce.

Siew Mai were meaty and nice, worth the order for any dimsum trip.

Poached prawns are very savoury and fresh.

So is it worth another visit? Maybe? Likely not. It's refreshing to see their dimsum being served by the sushi trains u saw in Genki. But other than that, food wasnt very amazing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ME9QWF9BRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Excellent service from staff Berlin! Having buffet here with a very reasonable price. Surprisingly all the food was amazing and delicious. Look at the pic!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNk42VVVBEAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,Was celebrating my birthday.  Very nice food. At the first was very nice. But small accident with crocoach when the delivery tray send to my desk. But reported to the staff and they had quickly kill and remove the crocoach.  Didn't take the picture as I respect the owner business.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdHVlam9nRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"The Famous Irish Rosted Duck Very Juicee , is to die for, have to try it. Have 2 Souce, Plum Souce is 5 Star, and Sweet and Sour Pork Excellen. Best Service by Alan. 😊👍👍👍👍👍✨️"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncTRUTXdnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Fairly good menu choices. Have the usual dim sum choices. There's also a fridge selling some of their signature food in vacuum packed ready-to-heat-up pouches.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPalotMzdRRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Food is nice and fresh! thumb up for the services too! 👍🏻👍🏻 recommend to family and friends gatherings! 😊
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVOWFEZXFBRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,1,"Being here for some many times. So I have to review again after last visit. The roasted duck is horrible. definitely not fresh, it come with a strong ransid and a stale meat taste. service standard drops alot as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHFPRkt3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"nice place if want to eat hong kong dim sum, there's vip room if more people are dining, the restaurant staff are friendly too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cEtEY2xBRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Always very tasty and delicious. The automated trays add a different experience from other dim sum restaurants.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OVkyLTJnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,All the Dim Sum are really yummy! Alan is a nice and friendly service staff. He recommended me a few special dishes for customer who dine in. I really love the special dishes a lot. Will definitely come back here to eat again in Novena Square TungLok Teahouse😊😋👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cy1tZGxBRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"At Tunglok Teahouse, Square 2. Service staff especially Alan super friendly and attentive. Will share about the food and chat politely to my 80+ mother, making her happy. But our negative feedback is to bring back the Beef Brisket Soup Noodles, because the older folks prefer that as the meat is softer for them. Hopefully this dish can come back, as my mom really loves it.

Again, thanks to Alan for making my mom happy each time she is here. It is an experience for her."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcV92ZTF3RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Food is delicious and served in good portions. Huge variety and value for money! Not forgetting excellent and friendly service from Lisa! My family and I enjoy our time at the dinner buffet very much.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUxpMndBRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Fun dining experience. The dim sum comes on the train and my 2 year old loved it. Service was good and staff were friendly and polite which, if I may say, is uncommon in such casual dining places in Singapore. The food was good but a bit too salty for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5azdUOU9REAE,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Went for the buffet,simply love the food. Quite delicious some of them ended up with yummy desserts.
Staffs are very friendly. Will be back again to try more food from the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTVYbURBEAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Mr Alan who served us is a professional staff. He made good recommendations to the food and was not pushy to make us over order.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2ZiTzhBRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,1,"1/5

Service was POOR, oh wait absolutely no service at all. Yet, there was still 10% service charge. Food was served via a conveyor belt - so where’s the service in that? And they made me queue for 20 mins just to foot the bill? Absolutely pathetic. The cashier was just have a casual conversation with another customer which held up the entire queue. Talk about customer service - really??

As for the food, it completely lacked quality. For the price charged, you’d have a better time at other more establish dim sum places. Ordered the white bait fish which felt like it was just a plate of fried flour. The prawn dumpling was sticky and tasted bland af. The conveyor belt also served one of our dishes to ANOTHER table before sending it back. Come on la

The only saving grace… oh wait none. This place is definitely not worth going - skip it babes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGZXV1VnEAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Very good food, not too crowded for a weekend lunch. Food is not cheap but very tasty and service is good. My favourites were the stir fried  asparagus with black fungus and pine nuts,  sweet and sour pork and various dimsum dishes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1X1pEWDB3RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Had a lovely dinner and thank you Ms Berlin koh for the awesome service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMDZlaXF3RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,Lisa is a very good host and made us feel very welcome. The food is delicious and we have been coming back often to try the dinner buffet. The ala carte items are wide ranging and worth the value. Will come back again for another celebration 🍾
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzUyel9BRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Good variety of food, friendly and efficient staff. The train concept keeps the children engaged and makes dining out fun and different from most other restaurants.

Lost a star as some dishes are on the expensive side - $23 for a beef hor fun dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTZxREJREAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Lisa (staff) explained the details of the membership and she was so hospitable in serving us the food. My guests and I enjoyed our dining experience here.

I would definitely recommend friends to visit TungLok Teahouse."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWViUW93RRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"I would like to compliment A very kind and friendly staff of yours, Mr Alan!

He never fails to greet us every time we visit. In fact, he took the effort to remember us!

Kudos to such an awesome worker of yours. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdWZ1OUxREAE,TungLok Teahouse,3,"Today is my birthday, just want a peaceful corner as my little one said she would like to have dimsum.  We ponder around a few areas and decided to go square 2.  Saw this and went to book a space for 11am.  Was there at 10am haha.  Good choice for me as my little one was thrilled by the food sending out to the belt like tutu train style.  We had xiaolong bao, charsiew chee cheong fun, marinated pork ribs,
Custard (minion looking) buns, not so good as the 流沙包is quite dry...doesn't flowed just cute.  Shrimp dumplings is OK.

For that peaceful zone on Sunday  I'm contented with these.
Staff are quite friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDVpN1J3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Want to give a 6 star review to the staff Alan, he was very helpful and friendly. Food was delicious.  Serving time was fast. Have a pleasant experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aFl1Z1V3EAE,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Icy sweet and sour pork is the must try dish in the house. Nowadays you don’t find this dish easily in town.

三拼trio bbq is also delicious.

Two things could have been improved from the service side.
- not enough baby chair
- we were seated near the kitchen window where cooked food are ready to be served. The kitchen still uses the loud speaker to play alert sound to the waitresses to fetch the dishes to tables. Could be very annoying with repeat alert."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnFTRDVnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Food is served pretty quickly. Despite the price, its pretty delicious. Service staff is quick and efficient. Server Lisa is very friendly and helpful in recommendation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aV9pbnRnRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,Alan was efficient in serving table 35 and even portioning our food for us . He is also very alert to sense I was pregnant. I enjoy the service .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c3ZhWkZREAE,TungLok Teahouse,5,The service is really good. The person who served us is Alan. Such fantastic service. He is polite and attentive. Food here is good. We had dim sum.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa3RUNjhRRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,5,"Excellent noodles which were not too springy or too soft. We had a great server, Lisa - she took the time to understand what we liked and was attentive and checked if we needed more tea."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNU5iY3VRRRAB,TungLok Teahouse,4,"Went for their buffet on a wed night, it was almost full house once they start business.

Their dishes serve decently fast once ordered through their ipad.

The prawn dumpling soup is the best for me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyei1qNmh3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Finally found a authentic Korean restaurant that doesn't sell BBQ food 🤣
Wanted to taste an original black bean sauce noodles, and this is just great. The other spicy seafood and Oyster noodles are nice and tasty too. Noodles more like Chinese noodles than the usual Korean Ramen though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX2RPZDhBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Finally managed to try it on my 3rd visit as they were closed when I tried to visit earlier.

Try sweet and sour pork as it was highly recommended in  the reviews. Love that they use lean meat and the taste is well balanced and does not feel oily. Although the portion is labelled as 'Small'  I think it is good enough to be shared between 3 to 4 pax.

Black bean noodles is great 👍it is chewy and taste authentic. Portion is HUGE. I think 1 bowl can feed 2 girls or 3 small kids.

Kimchi is great and they are refillable.

Their service crew was quick in noticing that we were having trouble trying to eat the noodles and offered us a pair of scissors to cut them.

Will definitely go back to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcXNQbDN3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Slightly on the pricier side but as authentic as it gets.

We ordered Set C (s$46) which consist of a Jjajangmyeon (noodle with black bean sauce), a Jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and a Tang Su Yuk (sweet and sour pork). On top of that we separately ordered another Jjajangmyeon (s$10.80) and a fried chicken with garlic sauce (s$32). This is good enough for 4pax. The noodles were well prepped and flavorful. The fried chicken was really spicy but shiok! Also, they only serve free flow preserved pickles, kimchi and raw onion as side dishes.

This restaurant has no reservation system in place so do visit early to avoid queuing!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteU1Dd2NREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Bare minimal decor, the place is hidden behind the bus stop at Novena Regency, is the only place with queue during dinner.

Known for their Jajangmyeon and Tangsuyuk (Korean version of sweet and sour pork). But unlike other places, their Tangsuyuk (from $24/small) is made of deep-fried pork stripes, lightly battered before being coated in a well-balanced sweet & sour sauce. Cut into bite-size, it is pretty addictive to munch on though it’s recommended to eat them hot as it hardens when it’s cool.

For those who prefer something spicy, Kkanpunggi aka Spicy Garlic Fried Chicken (from $32/small) can set your tongue on fire. Deliciously fried chicken, it is enrobed in a red spicy sauce filled with peppers and garlic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMlBTWkRBEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Another good jajangmyeon option. We tried their seafood fried jajangmyeon. It's oilier as compared to the usual jajangmyeon as there is chilli oil in it but its more fragrant than the usual jajangmyeon. Not the best but worth a try. We like their spicy garlic fried chicken. Delicious 😋 😋 😋  as its full of onion, garlic and chilli. Mukjja is definitely a korean Chinese restaurant worth a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ2RIdlFREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"The black bean sauce noodles is delightful! I enjoyed it! Kimchi is very nice!! Thankful for the complimentary barley tea. Spicy noodle taste good as well.
The korean-chinese rendition of sweet and sour pork is interesting. Heavy batter (not a fan of this) but flavourful. I wish it has more types of veg! The black fungus seems to be a bit out of place. However, the serving is too much. I wish they can provide smaller serving at a cheaper price so that patrons can consider other dishes. Halved the portion ($10-$12) will be good for 2!
I would love to come back for the spicy garlic chicken and dumplings. Price is on the higher side but the portion fits the bill. I think smaller serving with proportional price point will attract returning customers 😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMXVMX3hnRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,The jjajamyeon here is really the best I’ve had in Singapore! Super flavourful and the noodles is nice and chewy. The sweet and sour pork is really good too. But it can be quite heavy to eat the entire plate to share between two pax. But definitely will be back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta29URERREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Finally found a jjajangmyeon in sg that I really like. Not too sweet.
Sweet and sour pork was nice too.
The only disappointment was the jjamppong.. I really liked the soup but..there were only noodles, tonnes of onions, some bits of cucumber and 1 tiny piece of squid in it.. For the price we are paying..($40 for the set as shown in the photos) just feel that there should be more seafood in the “seafood” noodles.. not just 1 tiny piece of squid."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM2Y2c2h3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"super good jjajangmyeon!!!! the spicy fried chicken is good too! japchae is on the sweet side. love their kimchi too! portions are huge so good for groups, if not it would be too pricy per pax"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbnItR0p3EAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,recommended only for the black bean sauce noodles. it's super delish! but the ginseng chicken soup can skip.. cos we saw the chef bringing out an instant ginseng chicken soup... the kind you can get from supermarkets or online yourself.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bWFuZzdBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Went at 2pm weekday Wednesday and ordered Set C. It consists of 1x Jjampong(spicy noodle), 1x Zhajiang noodle(minced pork dry noodle), 1x large plate of fry Sweet sour pork with refillable simple banchan of kimchi, onion and pickles. Jjampong was spicy taste good but only onions and 3 small pieces of squid. The dry noodle was atad too oily but the crunch frehs kimchi and pickles neutralise it. Sweet sour pork was medicroe nothing to shout about. Overall costed $50 but would not go back to have as tried others w similar Priceline in sg with much better taste and more ingredients(eg. Hwang sil)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd3RmbHp3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"We ordered the jjm, dumplings, seafood stew and the must-order sweet n sour pork.

The pork was a little expensive given the portion (had alot more veggie/onions so the plate itself looks quite full). Dumplings and jjm were average to me. Pretty decent seafood stew but again too much onions for my liking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMEppWHFnRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"An after picture would better represent what we thought about the restaurant!

Authentic noodles, or at least I came for the noodles. Jajiangmien was really nice, sweet and fragrant, chewy noodles to complement, meat, bean and onions all mashed up in a beautiful dish. Japjae was sweet despite not being cooked with any meat. At least for me, this was a little treasure at a lesser known corner in Novena."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN19udkVBEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Decent, homely! The zhajiang noodle is AMAZING. U should really try it if u are there. The fried rice is decent because of the after taste. When I first bite it, nothing special but I like the lingering after taste. The sweet and sour pork is a little too sweet for my liking. Too much sauce.

The fried dumpling, I love it! Overall ,not bad but the beer is really expensive"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN2Ruakh3EAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,Our favourite Korean-Chinese restaurant in Singapore. We visit this place very often and each time it never disappoints us. Out favourite is black bean noodle (짜장면) and samsun jjampong (삼선짬뽕). Service is good and price is reasonable for authentic Korean foods.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdk4yU1VnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Have tried Set D - Sweet & Sour Pork + Stir fried Seafood Black Bean Sauce Noodles (Jajangmyeon), the food portion is big and should be enough for 3 persons with normal appetite. Authentic Korean food as the restaurant is opened by Korean, especially the Jajanhmyeon is a must try. The food is a bit pricey and the variety is not much, topokki is not available too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X0w3X3JRRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,2,Average at best. Set C came up at a total of $50.6 which is overpriced for the quality of food. Every dish there comes with an abundance of onions in them with the seafood soup with only two slices of squid in it. The bean paste noodles also has very negligible amount of meat bits in it. Sweet sour pork was also not crispy at all. Overall it’s rather disappointing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anNHaFhREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"My 2nd time eating Korean Chinese restaurant. Would say this place is the best value for $$. Ban Chan is good especially the Kimchi. Best dish of the day is the Tangsuyuk followed by Jjajangmyeon and Jjamppong.
For Tangsuyuk, the sauce and meat is better than the 1st. Jjajangmyeon the 1st is better but the onions in the sauce is more. Jjamppong tasted average. Ordered a set C for a young family of 4 is just right."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bk1fdEJBEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,2,First time 'seafood noodles' only had 1 seafood item - sotong. Seafood means minimally prawn and sth else but not even the sth else. Omg and it's $14. Quite disappointing. And the sweet and sour pork is not say very tasty or special. It's just normal. Zhi char has better kolo meat I feel. We always see queues during weekends. Now I don't understand why.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ek5McktnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Absolutely love the black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork, can really taste the authencity! The portion for the set meal is great and really worth the money. Service staff were nice! Food was served promptly! Will visit again👍 Thank you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOXRpTDlnRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"We ordered their tangsuyuk (sweet & sour pork), jajangmyeon (the noodle with black sauce) and jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle). They are all delicious and at a reasonable price. Definitely will return again. They're pretty popular these days, we were lucky to get the last table on dinner time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeWU3Z0dBEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,1,"Ordered Set C, which consisted of Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork), Jjajangmyeon(black bean sauce noodle) and  jjampong (spicy seafood noodle).

The sweet and sour pork was too oily, we ate two to three pieces and it was too ‘Jelak’ for us. The pork was also not crispy and not appetising, the whole dish was ways off….

The Jjajangmyeon has only onion and nothing else, it was also too greasy. The jjajangmyeon tasted and looked like those packaged Jjajangmyeon you can find in the Korean food section in Cold Storage. There are other restaurants in Singapore that serve much better Korean black bean sauce noodle than this shop.

The spicy seafood noodle was also a huge disappointment. The soup tasted like instant noodle soup. We ordered ‘seafood’ noodle but there was no seafood at all, there were only three pieces of cured squid pieces with lot of onions. The noodle was also not authentic and not freshly made.

Definitely, will not visit this shop again. My advice to the owner or the cook is to go thru the YouTube, there are many channels that teach people how to cook simple Korean food. Please learn from these channels on how to cook proper Jjajangmyeon and Jjampong."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bGNtNHlRRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"The jjamppong and jjangmyeon we ordered were really delicious and noodles were cooked to perfection. However, I have to say that the taste has been adjusted for local taste buds. The jjamppong would have tasted better if it was slightly spicier and had more ""wok hey"". We ordered their fried Mandu to try and finished everything as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb01YOXZBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Rebranded from the one that originally located at CQ Central. It might be my failing memory but had thought the taste was not up to mark after relocating to novena. While it tastes great (and sticky), the tangsuyuk had a lot of bites. But at least it reminded us to chew well before swallowing. Jjajungmyun will feed you well and at $11++ per bowl, it's probably the cheapest from a restaurant. The dumplings are a hit or miss with a price tag of $10++ for 13 bite-sized ones."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOTgtNHV3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Nice selection of food. Taste of authentic korean food. The jja jiang miang taste super good unlike some places.

But I ordered wrongly. I didn't know the seafood soup got noodles too. Ended up I overflow myself and bill cost more for 1 person due to my own wrong order.

They also have free flow side dish available."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMjZTb3l3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,2,"As many have commented, the black bean sauce noodles are good. Price increased by a lot (set C from $46 to $53) before service charge, and this just happened this month I think. I saw some reviews had bad experiences with the aunties and that happened to me too. Place was 20% full and what’s the issue with us shifting to a bigger table when the small table was not enough to accommodate our food comfortably? It was Sat evening but still early at 6pm. When we left at around 7pm, there were still 2-3 empty big tables. It’s a turn off when these ppl can’t even display some proper service and had to argue with the customers over such petty stuff. That auntie was sarcastic too and said we requested to change the table a few times, that was due to her poor Eng and comprehension that the first table near to entrance had hot and cold air alternations whenever the front door is being opened and we wanted to shift inside to another table (also 4-seater which she rejected and insisted for us to move to a 2-seater). After sitting down it felt too small as the set consists of two bowls of noodles and a big plate. The neighboring table (4-seater) also had 2 customers seated there ordering either similar things or lesser. So why the fuss about the move in order to “reserve” it for bigger group?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM01HWGxBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,1,"Eat at your own risk. I’m not sure what’s the rave’s about. Bill was $42, if you wan to Taobao, they charge a hefty 50cents+get.   :( service was good as they noticed we had kids and required fork and spoon and scissors. Food was not nice though. The sweet and sour pork was so so and the veggies were not cooked. The jjm was very salty and not much ingredients. Seafood food had a measly 2 pieces of squid as seafood, not even fake crabmeat or frozen shrimp. Everything was just full of onions. Lastly is the side dishes, only kimchi, nothing else. Me and hubs got diarrhoea and vomiting after eating here. Sad"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdDUzWkF3EAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Ordered the half jampong n half jajangmyeon.
The portion is huge and almost x2 of normal size. The jampong is spicy and jajangmyeon has strong taste of onions as the sauce has lots of onions.

While the taste is authentic but the cooking taste is not my preference.

However I like to say the customer service is very good. And a lot others seem to like as its full house even on wkday lunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpOUphUlJnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Place is kinda packed during lunch and dinner time. Food is not bad but a little too pricey. Went 2 times.

Ordered the glass noodles during my first visit. Not too sure why there isn't any sliced pork in it when it is clearly stated on the menu that there will be sliced pork. Ordered the jajang rice too. The looks of the jajang rice is pathetic. Just a plate of rice with a fried egg + the sauce. If I remember correctly the glass noodles is 18 dollars and the jajang rice is 15 dollars. Also ordered the sweet and sour pork. Pork hardness is inconsistent. A good portion of it was hard af and the rest were just nice. Can't remember how much was it but it's definitely more than 20 dollars.

Ordered jajang noodles the 2nd time I went. Not too sure what's the hype about. While I feel it does taste better than the average jajang noodles you can find in Singapore, it certainly isn't very special or unique. Also ordered some spicy garlic chicken. It's better than the sweet sour pork. Costs 35 dollars and it's not even the big size. It's small size which is meant for 2 to 3 pax.

Overall I feel this place is overpriced. Food taste slightly above average. But for the price I'm paying I'll be expecting more than just slightly above average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMjhQbldnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Visited the restaurant on Wednesday Night, we needed to wait for about 10-15 minutes since all the table were full at that moment. Ordered their set menu, comes with 2 bowls of Jjajangmyeon and one bowl of Tangsukyuk (sweet and sour pork), ordered one small portion of Fried chicken with soy bean sauce, portions are generous. Comes with free flow of drinks, kimchi, radish, onion and the small dot of black sauce."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NTVxRHNnRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Nice location, authentic food, good service.

The 2-3 pax black bean noodle set is truly sufficient for 3 men 🤤 Good value 👍🏻👍🏻

The give pickles and kimchi for side dishes, but they tasted really good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeHNyYkNBEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,The tangsuyuk was very good. Shaped more like a fry than a cutlet it was crunchy. Had an argument with my hankok gu because she ordered the original soju flavour when I wanted the blueberry flavoured one. She called me a noob. Tmd. Dulan. Team blueberry pls like my review.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNXJLcXNRRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,The stir-fried Jajangmyeon tasted alright and I think they can do an option so that you can order a smaller portion for cheaper. The ginseng chicken soup was great 👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbUtHSmFREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,"Definitely the place to go for good jamppong and jajangmyeon. Waited for ard 30 mins to get a table on a Sunday afternoon. It was raining that time which might have resulted in a shorter queue. The noodle is really good. Jajangmyeon is almost similar to what I have tasted in Seoul. The tangsukyuk is less crispy than some other stores in Singapore, I guess it owes it to lesser batter used, but still, their tangsukyuk is pretty good too. Didn't received the 'excellent' service as many had reviewed. We were the only table not served with barley tea and finally served when asked. The table that came and ordered later than us got their food earlier than us. There was a lapse in their food hygiene - i found a strand of hair in our bowl of jajangmyeon, what an anticlimax after all that waiting to dig in. Fortunately, the staff were sincerely apologetic and replaced with a new one immediately. Definitely would go back again if i didnt find the hair in my bowl of noodles, ewww."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bGF1WVh3EAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,1,I ordered seafood fried rice but it was super disappointing. It costs $15 but looks so poor in terms of ingredients. I probably could get better seafood fried rice at any hawker center less than $5. Please do not order seafood fried rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdzRydWl3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"If u want to enjoy something very Korean Chinese food, you must try here.  Every time I visited here, all the menu I tried made always me feel I was at home, Korea.  Still keep exploring other different dishes, nothing let me down so far.

Adding on Sep 19th, 2020
This restaurant seems to have become more popular these days.  The hall is full of local young generations at 11:40am and even such a long queue outside.  Hope this one keeps the same quality forever."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE1iaVBnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Tried Set C which consisted of the jjajangmyeon, jjampong(seafood noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork)! 3 of us shared the set and food portions were definitely sufficient. Liked the jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk the most; the jjajangmyeon sauce was savoury enough but not too jelat, and the tangsuyuk was nicely fried and went great with the sticky sweet and sour sauce! Will definitely come back again :) the kimchi was great too - crunchy texture and really good seasoning"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjX2RNMBAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"I was so excited to chance upon Mukjja and amazed to learn that this is the ONLY Korean Chinese restaurant in Singapore that makes their own noodle every day! That explains extra chewiness and authentic taste of their signature black bean noodle (jjajangmyun).

Though the typical jjajangmyun uses pork, they also serve seafood version, unlike few other rivals, so my mom could finally enjoy it to her heart’s content.

I was there on the opening week and felt the spicy jjamppong was way too spicy. We provided feedback and hope they have tweaked the spicy formula a bit.

My son who never touches any dish with sauce totally loved the sweet and sour pork. It was softer than other place but easier to chew as a result.

Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MEx5LVpREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Really delicious and authentic Korean food!!
Jjm was worth it, cause $11 for the big bowl."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdTlyQ25BRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"If you want black bean noodles (jjajangmyeon) this is the place to go to! The noodles were springy and chewy and the sauce was smoky and complex.

But take note of the long queue. I had to wait 45 minutes for a table on a Friday evening. The queue only got longer later into the evening"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb2FlamFREAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Jajangmyeon is very good and the serving size is quite large. The service standards at this restaurant surpass most others: the staff pays close attention to your dining experience and would attend to you automatically. Dropped a chopstick and they will automatically pass you a new pair, automatically replenish the side dishes, ask you whether you'll like raw onion to go with the food etc. Will come back again for the jajangmyeon and good service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOF9XLWRnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Was skeptical about this place initially as it was introduced by one of our friends who sometimes make poor choices when deciding on food places.
She has proved us wrong this time.

Ordered a few dishes that evening, and the 2 dishes that left a deep impression was the Jajangmyeon and the sweet and sour pork. Super tasty! The first thing we complimented was not the food but to our dear friend who chose this place for dinner.

We did not have to wait too long for our food to be served. Service was excellent and the staff were very attentive to our requests.

As a local food critic, I will rate this place 9.43 out of 10 (give face abit and rounded up to 5 stars in this review). Highly recommended 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpanVyc3VBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,Had the Jajangmyeon and the portion was huge. The noodles were chewy and delicious. Loved the tangy kimchi and pickles which helped to balance the meat sauce.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbU1iajB3RRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"The jajangmyeon tasted a little different from Tae Woo’s to me, but their sweet & sour pork was much better than Tae Woo’s."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcVp1aVFnEAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,3,Honestly speaking nothing to shout about! For the price point you can get better Korean food out there! For e.g obbjang or SBCD. Can come if there’s  no queue
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaVlubk13EAE,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,1,"I always go to eat there for years, I likes the food even though the boss go back Korea and close the restaurant without noticing. Until now, they asked me to stay outside for takeaway. There isn’t by government regulations and there no guest except me. It’s hot and no chair outside , I’ll never go back…"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpOE42ZXBBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,4,"Jjm is decent, but not the best, however, their sweet and sour pork surprised me, highly recommended..99/100! Simply can't stop 🤩👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ3ZpdDNBRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,5,"Was previously an avid fan of obba.jajjang but after I visited this place!! I’ve never visited obba!!!
Their price point is more affordable than obba $11 for Jajangmyun (didn’t take note for the tangsuyuk and jam pong) but other than it’s price it’s one of the best Jajangmyun I’ve ever had!! (Even compared to those I got delivered to in Korea). You can tell that the sauce was home made (or at least I feel so) because it’s light and had a unique flavour. The jjampong also blew my mind with its milky seafood broth. The tangsuyuk is to die for esp with the portions and ingredients. I love the black fungus they generously added in!!
I think overall what I’m most impressed about is that most food I eat outside (obba included) leaves me thirsty however for mukkja amazingly it doesn’t!!

I even brought over my parents who hardly live outside food out and they approved!!!

Only have good things to say about this restaurant and would recommend to anyone who wants to have a good hearty bowl of Korean Chinese food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODVfLW1BRRAB,Mukjja Korean Chinese Restaurant,1,"If you stay more than 3 minutes after you finish eating, a staff would discomfort you, saying wants to clear the table while she is staring at the waiting queue despite 20 minutes of eating."

The proprietress is so kind and very nice, and eating at the winter solstice really brings warmth to the wanderers in Greater China. I hope the business of the boss and wife is prosperous!

The bee Tai Mak was awesome and among the most tasty and filled with wok hei, definitely a must order !!!

Prawn paste chicken wings was well seasoned  was fried till crispy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeF9QQjFRRRAB,Fried Rice SG,4,Ordered Pork Chop fried rice with fish roe. Fried rice is good. Its taste like zichar style and seems similar to King of Fried Rice. Wasn't expecting the server to hand me a tissue but it's a really nice service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azdibnZ3RRAB,Fried Rice SG,4,"Overall a disappointment. Though the fried rice was fragrance but the rice were way too meshy, probably an off day for them but I can only rate what was served.

I also decided to add a squid cutlet to the fried rice instead of the usual chicken/pork cutlet but it was pathetically bite size yet cost much more than if ordering the chicken/pork cutlet fried rice combo.

2nd visit:
A much improvement over the 1st visit, maybe cos I have it on site this time. Also only after the meal then I realised they actually have an indoor dining area which is hard to notice cos the kitchen is right in the middle between the indoor and outdoor seating."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1anJDdi1nRRAB,Fried Rice SG,2,"Was in the area at abt 2.30pm and read the good google reviews. Hence decided to try out as the place was empty too.

Ordered the $5.50 egg fried rice and pandan leaf chicken. Cashier mistakenly keyed as pork chop fried rice. Nvm I just go along to see if the higher price of $8.50 is worth it.

Verdict: Overrated & overpriced food for total damage of $10

Pork chop was really tough, not crispy at all and taste bland.

Fried rice got nice 'wok hei' yet was bland as well. Normal coffeeshop tze char's fried rice taste better at lower price.

Saving grace was the pandan leaf chicken which was not bad. But it was a extremely tiny piece which didn't justify the $1.50 price.

Furthermore, even if u dine-in, the food is served in paper boxes and disposable cutleries are used. Might as well do take-away only."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMC1XX2xRRRAB,Fried Rice SG,4,Good plate of fried rice. Just abit wet but the rice has strong wok hei. Pricing is very good. Love the chicken cutlet. Overall will be back!

Rice was very flavourful on its own and luckily the cashier lady told me to have less chili for this. Totally agreed with her after tasting the rice. Chicken was tender and not dry.

The chicken cutlet was really fried upon order so they came piping hot, which was great, but if they let the oil drain for a while longer I wouldn't have felt it too oily for my liking. I found that the rice used was more fluffy and moist than what I remembered of King of Fried Rice, so that's a plus."

Pork Cutlet Fried Rice $7.90.
Super generous portion, fried rice is super fragrant, pork cutlet is large and flavorful. Good amount of eggs and abit of veges too..
Score: 8/10 for me.

Mushroom and Edamame Fried Rice $7.90.
Again, generous portion of fried rice. I was extremely surprised by the amount of vegetables, compared to the pork cutlet fried rice, the box is filled up by 20% more just by vegetables. Mushrooms had good chew and flavor, Edamame was cooked just right, and added good crunch to the rice itself.
Score: 10/10.

Ngoh Hiang $2.30:
Tastes homemade, flavor is good, not overly salty skin and meat, very good as a side.
Score: 7/10

Squid Roll $2.30:
Another surprise, the texture of the squid meat and the seasoning is spot on. No fishiness, and surprisingly super tasty.
Score: 9/10

I am most definitely coming back to try more menu items. Overall, amazing value for money and taste for something so simple."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2di03LTJRRRAB,Fried Rice SG,4,They took more than 40 minutes to serve my order. How could you let someone who is dining in wait for more than 40 minutes? I lost my appetite.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbThla0pnEAE,Fried Rice SG,5,Had Italian herb chicken fried rice. Best I have had so far!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNk8tRHV3RRAB,Fried Rice SG,1,"No point ordering. Tried for one hour to get my delivery. No support, nothing. Very sad as we used to like this place. Sad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbi1UQjFBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,This was quite an unusual experience. Yunnan cuisine. Not sure if it’s authentic but it’s different from usual. I had the minced meat and salted veg soupy noodles plus set meal. Minced meat reminded me of zhajiang mian minced meat. Bowl was huge but mostly just soup. Soup was mild to medium spicy. But had the salted vegetable taste. Not bad. Egg was kind of hard and dry. I guess it’s their style. Different from the Japanese style. Dessert was a bit like ice jelly without ice. Not too sweet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX18yc0pREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,Came during the lunch rush hours… the servers are very attentive to the customers… ensuring that the waiting queue gets updated on the seating arrangements… orders are taken prior to sitting to save time… my favourite dish though was the pumpkin cake… will have to come try the other dishes…
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtazZfOTJ3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"You can customise your bowl here . Option of thick bee Hoon noodle,  flat noodles , glass noodles etc

Soup variety pork bone , spicy yunnan pickled cabbage  , tomato 🍅 and another pepper version .

I got the yunnan pickled cabbage , it’s tangy , sour and very appetising .

You get to select the ingredients you want to add such as vege , meats, fish ball etc

Giving 5 star due to the customer service crew, food will be 4 star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ01EOXZnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Not sure if this is authentic yunnan rice noodles. But it sure taste good for me. The soup base is full of flavor, noodles texture are just right. And the rest of the add on ingredients are fresh and good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MVpyakZREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,1,"My colleagues and i decided to try this. I ordered a bowl of customised tomatoes soup w pork ribs, beef ball, luncheon meat, quail eggs, tofu skin. The soup was diluted. Pork ribs were mini and tough, did not find my luncheon meat, miserable piece of tofu skin.
My colleague's chicken is as miserable. Its like mini chicken carcass with some meat. My meal cost me $17 and definitely not value for money nor satisfying. It will be our first and last time ordering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ2RTanVBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,"We had a few tries in this Restaurant over the past 3 years. I would say the settings and food was much better prior to the pandemic period.
The restaurant went tasteless and dirty post second lockdown. But since the recent reviews aren’t bad we decide to give it another try.
It is not too bad actually, and I appreciate the free choice of none spicy at all. But add-ons is to be avoided: we paid $2.5 for dried braised beef and get literally 2 slices of 3*3cm sheer sheet. I’m being specific beer as it is a nonsense money value proportion compare to their own dishes. And not mentioning how big portion you could get from other Chinese restaurants."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eFotc2FBEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Tried a few items on their menu like their signature rice noodle, their braised chicken rice and their lu rou fan. They are really good. Really liked the pumpkin dessert as well it is really addictive. Opens early at 10am and service is really fast. Will definitely try again if possible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd0p5Q21RRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Very JENG yixia worr... I very likey the signature pork rib soup. $12.90 for standard product which come with 12 ingredients... Very FRESH too the seafood 🐟🐟🐟🦐🦐🦐
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPalk3Wk5nEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Wanted a drink while waiting for my appointment. Order soy milk but no more. Waitress is nice, she give suggestions recommending 八宝茶which is not in the menu. Taste great."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeExtZDVnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Comfy food during raining day.. I ordered the original and the soup broth is clear and nice. Doesn’t taste much MSG.. ordered a set come with a drink, an egg and a dessert. The prawn is fresh, shelf removed for you and left the head and tail. Give it a try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dl9xaDlRRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Had the braised intestine vermicelli 红烧肥肠米, the intestine was soft and well braised, no funky smell or whatsoever, vermicelli was soft and silky unlike our local thick bee hoon. Soup might look spicy but it's not, the colour was from the braising sauce of the intestine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdUl2YWJREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,1,"I am not sure if the cook is having an off day but this was what came to me. It looked like the left overs of a meal. I was pretty disappointed. The soup was diluted, and the ingredients were so stingy. I asked for two portions of corn and got about 15 kernels. Would not come again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta3JpbHZBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,2,"Prices are low and portions are big.
Taste is decent but nothing to shout about. Soups were abit diluted, partner's mixian was cooked to mushiness, but mine was fine.
Ice jelly was a let-down, tasted just like regular jelly. Probably will not return."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHc0xXQzFBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Nice Yun nan noodle place in Singapore. So unique and tasty.

I had the sour and spicy soup, which was good and compatible with most of the ingredients. The soup taste was just alright, not too spicy, not salty.

Just a little feedback:

The noodle was too slight, probably it was soaked in the soup for some time before serving to me.

The fish slices and some ingredients were with bones. Suggested to substitute with boneless meat.

Other than that, all were perfect. Interesting interior design and attentive service too. Portion looked big but just alright for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OXNLMlpREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"If you would like try a different kind of normal noodle in singapore, you might want to try this noodle from yunnan. The biggest bowl of noodle soup i ever see with plenty of soup to satisfy anyone."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdHVuZ013EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Over the bridge noodles are served here. Drinks include Roselle tea. And dessert is a chilled fruit jelly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhdHUzeFBnEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Convenient place to walk from the MRT. Ordered the signature rice noodle. I like the lightness of the broth. You can tweak the spicy level by adding their in-house chili sauce. Overall unique Chinese food, which you don’t find in other places in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaC1PZ1hBEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Second visit and looking forward to a third! The service here is always excellent. I cannot vouch for their noodles but the set promo ($9.90 includes chicken, veggies, rice and a drink) is super tasty especially their house special mala chicken in a pot. Enjoy it with a hearty dollop of their homemade chilli paste/oil and the rest of your day will feel simply perfect!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bGFDb1BBEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,2,"The signature rice noodles was freaking weird to me. Pork rib, prawn, Shao Rou, stewed chicken, fish... A failed exploration"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXRYN0JBEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Friendly staff and delicious soup (it’s the diluted kind but it’s kind of just right for us). The pork were majority fats though. I love that we can DIY our own soup base, noodles, and ingredients. Will probably do that the next time we’re back.

We ordered signature rice noodles soup (with Spicy Pickled Cabbage Soup) and Fried Pork Rice Noodle (Tomato Soup).

Fang Ting and Wei Liang (lunch)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTc3dnBBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,My husband and I have been hunting for an authentic Yunan crossing bridge noodles in Singapore since we tasted the original ones during our visit to Yunan. Nothing has come close till we visited this place. The noodles and soup are good but the best are still those in Kunming.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMXZPTUFREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Second time visit this restaurant. Love the noodles and warm hearty soup. The ingredients are fresh and the portion is big. Worth the price. Would definitely come back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRc1B5V3J3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,"The cutleries are beautifully decorated, food is presented pretty before you mix the food together, the wooden furniture and decor gives a nice feeling.

Service was prompt and I noted they have chairs available for children.

Food is mediocre to my personal taste. The overall taste is light. While the noodle is springy and nice, the broth and the rest of the ingredients doesn’t seem to come together well. And the dish has abundant of soup compared to the contents (the vegetables floated while the rest of the ingredients drowned underneath) so a bit of stirring and searching may be needed to find the part you want to bite. The vegetables also look more like garnishes except for the bean sprouts (eg. Coriander, chives, spring onion, flower petals)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdlA2ai13RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,1,"Mixed bowl noodles, is taste-less and not the mushroom cut until so thin slice. A bowl of the noodles with 2 bird egg, 2 slice of fish 2 pieces of prawn.... etc and drinks add up to be about $17. Which is not worth the money.
The staff there rejected rudely from counter shout to the table ""sorry, cannot"" As they don't allow outside food although she have family members eating inside."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMGFqQmV3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,"I had the fried pork Noodle. The broth was delicious and there was a good amount ingredients in the dish. However, there were parts of the noodles which were clumped together and was undercooked and inedible. The fried pork that came with the dish although was cooked and tasted good, had slices which were just the fats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOXZEWnp3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"I am not a big fan of Chinese food but I have to say, this is one of the most satisfying lunch I hand for a very long time.

I wanted noodles with lots of vegetable options. When I look through the menu, the tofu noodles catches my attention and  so I place the order with the plum drink and the black fungus starter.

Never I expect to be surprised by the balance taste of the noodles. It was really really good. I never thought I could finish such a big bowl considering the size of it.

The starter is another pleasant surprise, so crunchy and I love every bite of it.

I will definitely be back for more...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMDZUS0RREAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Interesting Yunnan style eaterly. Nice presentation, and taste delicious.  Except serving for dessert a bit small. Anyway, the Cross-bridge rice noodles reminded me of my Yunnan trip many years ago."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ekxHOExnEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Agree with the comments that the broth was bland, especially the tomato one that I had. A tip: there’s house Chili on every table and putting that into the soup can elevate the taste! Otherwise price and service was decent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNnFMSUJnEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Super delicious noodles! Authentic taste with lots of options... My friends had the signature rice noodles and I had the pudding rice noodles - both were extremely good...will definitely be back soon :)
Service was also very warm and friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaEpld3JRRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Big portion for the price. Value for money. Drink is nice also. Would come back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbkxhRFl3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Me and husband like this place a lot
Generous portion of tasty pork bone soup- prob twice the size of a normal bowl of ramen - more then enough soup for 2 adults
Can customise carbo with toppings
Reasonable pricing
Every bowl is freshly prepared and consistency is there each time!
Will recommend esp if u have a friend or partner! Otherwise 1 bowl might appear daunting haha"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdk9td0hnEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Big bowl of soup and noodles as expected from yun nan 过桥米线，it has its own twist which is the chrysanthemum. And do beware because it has a layer of oil it keeps the soup hot so when its first served to you, blow to allow it to cool down first before you sip it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVZ2U3MGlnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,The only disappointment is that the soup is not hot enough after we poured everything into it and it's at the temperature of tongue. Chilli oil can be much better and sesame oil should be provided too. My 2 cents.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjd18tU1F3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"I always go for their Yun nan mi xian (glass noodle soup in a giant bowl). I’ve also tried their minced pork rice set. Tasty meal, very reasonably priced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMEozX2pBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,"Decent place for yunnan 过桥米线. Customised my own with pork broth, rice noodles, 4 vegetables and one meat for $7.20. The broth was really good but I felt the rice noodles could have been better and the portion of the ingredients could have been more generous. Service was prompt and there was just enough seats to hold the lunch crowd."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX29UbGJ3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,Very big bowl. Reasonable priced.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMnVfSzlnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,3,The portion is huge!! Signature noodle is not bad. Didn’t get to try others. Interior deco is interesting. Service is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnN05IN2V3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"The rice noodle set is presented nicely, but taste was ok only, nothing extraordinary. Price is expensive if there is no 1-for-1 promo. Sour and spicy noodle is much better and half the price of the rice noodle set."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0akphS3pBRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Nice and affordable breakfast and lunch place!!! You are also able to customize your noodles (though I felt like trying their rice instead). Will be back to try their cross-bridge noodles 😁
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aXZXbnB3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Yummy authentic food!! Their mala tang was so aromatic. House chili adds great flavour to the non-spicy pork broth option. Ingredients are a bit pricey for some items (e.g. chives and beansprouts) but since those are obviously not worth it, I did not add to my DIY bowl. Other than that, portion size is big! About 4 pieces of meat for each kind of meat that you pick."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MGFTTGhnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,2,"Is from Yunnan? No, I don’t think so! Totally different with Yunnan Ricenoodle. But as a food yes can eat, at least is hot. What I need mention is oil Chili source, very traditional Yunnan style."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFNWJDLTR3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,6.8SD for such a big bowel of rice noodle! Plus quite tasty ! Can’t believe it’s so cheap ( In singapore)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxb292UkF3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Great location, easily access through public transit. Food is delicious and portion is big, esp given the price u have to pay. Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NjlQMkt3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Very soothing for stomach and price is reasonable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbXVYQ0d3EAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,"Good authentic yunan food.
Great price.
Good environment and lovely staff as in lady boss and kitchen staff.
Good location.
Located 5 mins away walking distance from novena mrt

A must visit for local Singaporeans and also a must visit for tourists transiting Singapore or visiting Singapore as tourists."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdXFEQ0pnEAE,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Decent food decent price! Great Beancurd noodles.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDazdPZ2xnRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,I find the soup not enough taste. Too much water diluted the taste.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNamFfVjZ3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,5,Love the freedom to choose different vegetables or meats items with selected soup and noodles.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna2R5bHR3RRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,4,"Noodle soup was good. The noodles is probably the highlight here. Unique texture - soft and slightly chewy..you can taste the separate strands.  I ordered the chicken noodle soup but requested a hot version which was available. The chicken pieces could be chopped more cleanly as I found bone fragments. The eatery is offering a free drink which each noodle soup ordered. Service was fast. No GST, service charge. Good service. Will try the noodle item which comes with 12 side dishes in future. Another favourite is the hot and sour glass noodles. Fave app offers a 10% discount on your next visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMUtELW9nRRAB,唐大小姐过桥米线Mademoiselle Tang Noodle,2,"They used to have very good broth of pork ribs, even the original-flavoured mixian was tasty. But now, the original broth just gives a taste of salt."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cTkzTDR3RRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Five stars for the service. I think the food was above average. Plenty of parking at basement, so if you're driving to this restaurant there's parking at the restaurant. I love the panfried oyster cake! crunchy on one side - but need to wait about 25 minutes for this to be serve."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOHNLU2ZBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Nice ambience for a chinese Teochew restaurant. The braised duck is my favourite. Ordered the Chinese New Year braised sea cucumber, mushroom dish which is good. And of course, the steamed lobster is fresh and so good. Will come again just for the braised duck."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcHZtRzdRRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Service was far better than Jumbo. Quality of food very tasty n fresh.. Really a hidden gem in a Teochew club. Zui Teochew Cuisine should be very good too. All super yummy food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM2ZUekl3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"I went on a Sat and got seated at 1730hrs as it was fully book for the later seating. As we ordered quite a lot for 4 pax, we left at around 2045hrs. In between we still add dishes and that's why it took longer for us to finish it. There were very professional and only tell us that they needed the table back during dessert time.

Their food still taste the same as olden times so there is nothing to rave about. It's still as good as ever. If you have foreign guests can bring them there as it's quite traditional but yet classy due to the decorations. Its one of the more expensive place in town.

Ordered: ($370)
- mixed platter
- pomfret (700g)
- drunken chicken
- pork ribs (4 pieces, must order individually)
- fried kway teow
- french bean
- 4 individual desserts
- pot of tea"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcXJEY1p3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Came to this place to try traditional teochew food and was pleasantly surprised!

Food. The standard must order dishes like the ngoh Hiang, braised duck with tofu and orh nee were good and on point. The other dishes like the drunken prawns, trio egg vegetables , I'd probably not want to order them again. Furthermore these aren't traditional teochew dishes.

Service. It's very hard to catch hold of the staff as there were so many people. My advise is to order all your dishes at one go.

Additionally, you might want to make a reservation instead of coming to queue. Very packed for a Friday night."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGVxMVdREAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"I generally liked the food here. The appetizer plate was well executed and they were still hot when served.

The Compoy with braised vegetables and steamed threadfin also left a lasting impression. Really liked the umami from the Compoy dish since most of the ingredients were naturally high in umami.

I think one very strong area for improvement is their service and attention to customers, which is the reason why I didn't rate them 5 stars. When ordering, we informed that one of our dining party was still on the way and requested for the food to be served later. 5 mins before she reached, we informed one of the staff to serve the dishes, but half an hour later, nothing was served. When we checked in with another staff, he had the cheek to tell me that we had requested for the food to be on hold even though our party had been there for a good half hour.

We also placed an order for the threadfin subsequently. However, 40 mins later, this was still not served and we had to check with the staff on the status. Because of these delays, we had to spend close to an additional hour at the restaurant. The service aspect really has room for improvement and to caveat, I'm not expecting service standards at a Michelin star restaurant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM2RMTTlnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Came here with my family, was here many years ago but decided to bring my family to try the Teochew cuisine. We ordered those dish with great reviews and recommended by other reviewers. I must they they don’t disappoint, all the food we ordered were really good. Specially the braised duck, slices so thin it almost melts in the mouth. Don’t be deceive by the Ngoh Hiang, it looks normal, but just wait till you bite into it, makes you wanted more. The fish is really fresh and cook just nice. The vegetables is ok as I am not a fan. The Oyster omelette is really worth the wait, I was wondering why it took so long, it need skills to cook a simple dish to taste so good. Finally my all time favorite, Orh Nee, I have love it since young and none is better than this. Will come back for more in the near future. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aUxuYU5nEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Attended a dinner function here and I must say the food standard was really good. It's located in a pretty secluded location and I have never noticed it existed until I was invited to this dinner function. There Chinese design building architecture was unique in that locality and it can be mistook as an exclusive member only premise. However, it's also a Teochew restaurant open to the public. They serve dishes like Buddha jump over the wall, king prawn with broccoli, braised abalones with shiitake mushroom and spinach, signature Yam paste with gingko nuts and etc... My favor was the yam paste, sweet and flavorful. While the building look small, it's has ample parking spaces in their basement down to B3. Parking charges was also inexpensive. Go discover the great food within this quiet location."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMU1XTklnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"One of my best Teochew cuisine in Sg. (I’m a Teochew 😅) The roast piglet is pricy, but it’s so worth it.
Other than roast pork, the authentic fried kailan kway Teow and Yam Paste are not to be missed! We called it 古早味。实至名归。
Pricy, but if you willing to part $$, a meal to you will not forget."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMW96X2NnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Excellent Teochew cruisine, arguably the best in sg.  Tried a variety of their signature dishes and the sea cucumber, crispy on the outside and soft inside really stands out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM3FmYWZBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"After waiting for over 2 years due to Covid-19 to dine-in, the dishes are delicious, service is superb as always."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbzZ6M3pBRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Lovely food and good service. The lobster is very fresh and it is paired well with the sauce.

Promfet fish is fresh and we'll steamed (firm meat). The teochew style steam I think it's slightly too sour with the salted plums."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dTczdFZREAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Old school traditional teochew cuisine. Pricey but I think the quality of ingredients and mastery in the cooking makes it worth.

Good to come as a family to celebrate special occasions. Please get the fried sea cucumber and fried pork rib you will not regret it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMDZlTkN3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"The dishes were excellent - the cold crab, braised duck with bean curd (which was boneless), conpoy braised with eight vegetarian treasures, and yam paste with pumpkin and gingko nuts (seems to use pandan syrup instead of lard). The oyster omelette was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPZ3ZqR1N3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Must order - oyster omelette, fried sea cucumber, cold crab and duck! We enjoyed the meal, would go back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbHZITFJBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Tried their 4 pax set meal around $350++ plus their famous duck and fried oyster. Overall I like their garlic lobster and spinach with abalone. Their CNY Yusheng also quite special, unlike the conventional one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMjVqaThRRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,1,"Food is okay but service is average (maybe business is too good). The restaurant missed my reservation. I learned upon arrival (I have called in 3 weeks before). They then made arrangement for empty hall area at level 2 for lunch.

During this point of time the max number is 5 pax allowed per table and amazingly their set lunch menu only have 4 or 6 pax (maybe they dont care or can't be bothered).

I feel there are better choices out there and will skip this place for lunch next time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyclBDQU1BEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,My fav teochew restaurant at all times! Still good quality and service top notch! High price though but worth it!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNy1McHp3RRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Thank you B1 personal staff to attend to my dad’s guests this evening. Your service is excellent! Even though we had numerous requests, you did not falter and accommodated to our requests; even taking initiative to cut the cake after the celebration. Thanks for being part of this good memory of my dad’s 70th birthday. Sorry I did not manage to get your name. Kudos to all the staff who were helping in one way or another, even though the place was full, you all were polite and approachable. Food was great, everyone loved it. Even the vegetarian food was done very well. Thank you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bE9xLVpBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Excellent restaurant! Both the ambience and the food were great. The suckling pig is the star of the show! Very crispy and delicious skin. It will definitely be a dish to order. The braised duck was juicy and succulent as well. The rest of the dishes were really of high quality taste.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlczRyMmxnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Three words:Taste, freshness, quality. Service is attentive as well"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd2E2YjBBRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Authentic teochew dishes. Refined dishes. Worth a visit.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN3J5djFnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,3,"Difficult to get to, food quality is good, the place is trying to cram too many tables in resulting in super narrow walking spaces which is a hazard for kids and adults. Kids tend to walk around table to different adults but it's too dangerous for a proper family meal. Also witnessed an elderly being knocked flat on the ground with her shoe coming off a distance from her. Not sure what happened but sure looks painful next to the metal trolley in the small narrow pathway. Service staff moving too fast, rushing us to eat fast and clearing the plates before more companions come. Food came very fast though. My family enjoyed the braised beancurd and salted egg prawn."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N0tQeXRBRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Great food. Very polite and attentive wait staff even when it's full house. Must try their orh-nee (yam paste dessert), braised duck with tofu and ngoh hiang (superb on its own or with the plum sauce). I don't usually fancy fish dishes but theirs is so fresh! Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODVlbXlnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Very authentic food, taste is really good, among the best Chinese food I had in Singapore. For someone who is tired of crowd & popular business place, long queue, noisy environment, restaurant chain with same taste everywhere you go, this is a perfect option. Away from main business, a quiet & peace hidden gem near Newton MRT & Newton food center.

Very nice atmosphere with friendly service, provided separate wipes for cleaning utensils and hands, also provided welcome tea before the meal & Ginseng Oolong tea after meal to clean the taste from mouth.

Meat is well cooked and tasty, vegetable is fresh; fried rice is really large portion that allows 4 people to share. Tea is nice too, good quality Chinese tea with extremely good value, $3 for a whole pot. Waitress is very helpful in providing suggestions, service is always on time.

I would definitely recommend this place, and will come back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLd1ByY1FnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,We went to the restaurant with Jumbo’s birthday voucher (200-100). The dishes are delicious and the portions are quite generous. I think it’s a good place for family gatherings.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDRyT3JnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Had my birthday dinner here, Nothing to complain about
Quality of food is top notch, chef’s culinary skills is undoubtedly good
Service is super fast and pretty good, I mean like really fast.
Price is very competitive for the quality and environment, as proven by the full seating.
had the broiled chicken, stir fried mee sua, braised duck, lobster porridge (whole lobster), vege, salted egg yolk prawn with tea- only 55pp after tax

Will definitely come back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNd2Y2ajVnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"We had a delectable meal in this Teochew restaurant. The service was excellent too, attentive and prompt despite it being so crowded. The cold crab was my favorite. I love the freshness, plus the meat was thick and firm. Yummy indeed.

A delightful place to spend your Friday evening."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUlMTFhREAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,1,"Although the food is good, the service is subpar. I had a reservation for 5:30 and was informed that dinner would last 1.5 hours. After our first dish was served, it took them 40 minutes to serve the subsequent dishes. One of our dish, the steamed fish, apparently lost in the ocean. We finish our dinner by 7 o'clock even though the fish dish is making its way from the ocean."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHJPZFNnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Teochew cuisine and service were fantastic. Thanks to Liu Lei who was serving us. The roasted suckling pig exceeded my expectations. Other dishes were good too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eUlDRGhBRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Great service from Alfred Chia.  Personalised, professional and yet makes one feel so at home.  Dishes are still great standard (like before Covid).  If not for a bad customer experience with Veronica who ignored my help when I left something behind at dinner, I would have rated this restaurant 5*."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOHEyQURBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,This place serves very authentic Teochew dishes. Many of the dishes you don’t get to taste elsewhere! Brought my Teochew parent and they totally fell in love with the food here and walked out really happy!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Nk9XZEZnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Food is good but expensive, and servings are small, even for medium order. Don't ever order the Cuttlefish sauteed with XO sauce. $24 for a small serving. The cuttlefish can hardly be found, as there are few thin and small pieces, overwhelmed by the onion and bell pepper. Kailan stir-fried with dried sole fish is $24 for a small serving. Service is poor, as most of the staff are badly trained. I didn't feel satisfied."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZy02Wmd3RRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"I won't say there is any ambience...this is a traditional large spaced restaurant. However, they make it up with pretty quality for the food they serve-food not that cheap. A bit hard to find for first timers, so WAZE up. Parking not cheap-I paid $8 for my lunch hours. I would bring the older folks for that touch of the old days"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdU55aEhnEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Very nice clean restaurant for meals with friends during this covid period. Driving there will be preferred as you will need to walk of you want to take public transportation. If you like teochew dishes then it's a recommended place for it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMlo2WGhnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,Quite a nice place to bring my old folks here. Good restaurants and good wedding halls
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTZtYWp3RRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,Very nice Teochew dishes! Portion is not very big. Prompt service and staff were helpful. We were given a private room and all utensils are available for us to self help. But the entrance of the restaurant can be confusing. Overall experience is not bad. Total damage for all dishes = $700+ as we ordered roasted pig. The lobster dish is not worth I feel as it was full of garlic. The rest of the dishes are good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrXzRiOURBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,1,"It was a horrendous first dining experience at this notably renowned venue for Teochew cuisine. Regrettably I should have known from the deteriorating quality mentioned in earlier Google reviews. From the start, we had made a reservation via phone call for 9 persons, but we were shown to a table for 8 persons (7+1) When we questioned about that, the lady serving us had no answer and basically just replied that it’s okay they would add one more seat to a smaller looking table.  It was strange but I thought nothing of it until almost towards the end of the meal when we were again asked whether they could serve mixed fruits platter. That was when it hit me that they had mixed us up with another bunch of guests. Despite repeated complaints, none of the staff looked sincerely apologetic and merely was in a rush to turn over the table for the second round of diners. Apart from that, the quality of food served tonight was not outstanding, and service was rushed and nobody bothered changing plates or pouring tea till we asked for it. The pomfret appeared to be not cooked well, there was redness and toughness in some part of the meat. It is definitely not a place worth the premium paid for food, service, decoration or anything at all. Atmosphere wise, the place was noisy and warm with spot lights all over and little aircon. It was supposed to be a nice welcoming dinner for our guests but tonight it was nothing short of a disaster with the premium paid for dinner; total damage (bill) being more than 500 dollars. Consider seriously, if you really want to come to dine (unless you really have the cash to spare or prefer to take photos of the food presentation). Note: there was no service recovery done at all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDRubThnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"I happened to choose Fathers' Day to have dinner there with an old friend so there were two seatings for reservation: 5.30pm or 8pm. I booked for 8pm. We (group of six) were seated in a hall at L2. There weren't many people though i heard the restaurant at L1 was full.
The food was delicious. We had braised duck with beancurd (卤鸭拼豆干)，deep-fried ngoh hiang (五香枣)， Teochew steamed pomfrey (潮蒸鲳鱼), Teochew Puning fermented-bean chicken (普宁豆酱走地鸡)，wok-fried mee pok with braised duck with X.O. sauce (X.O.酱卤鸭面薄) and yam paste desserts (with hashima / slice of pumpkin). Two persons complemented their meal with a bowl of rice.

As my children were allergic to prawns, the waiter quickly came back to us when he found out the ngoh hiang contained prawn (he thought it only had pork).
My fav was the fish, and my friend (who hadn't been there for  quite a while) particularly liked the fried mee pok (i thought it was unusual too cos it's usu fried mee). The ngoh hiang was crispy and fragrant The yam paste was good (smooth, not cloyingly sweet or oily). Staff were helpful.

All in all, it was a pleasant meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdTZIS2JBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,3,"Food is decent but on the pricey side. Paid $200+ for 4 pax. Ordered 3 main dishes, 1 noodle dish and 1 dimsum appetizer.

Service is average. Asked for a nicer table during reservation as it was a special occasion, but the restaurant didn’t make any effort here. They even sat us super near the kitchen.

Paid $3.50 for single entry parking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcjczbW93RRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,3,"Decent food; but a little pricey for the seafood. Like the Fried oyster, braised duck with tofu (tofu is really tasty), sea cucumber and cold crab. However, the server is a little pushy on the order - keep telling you to order the lobsters, goose, some special fish etc. Be wary, a single order of lobster can be 300++ after 50% discount, crab is about a 100 etc"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNllUUkZ3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Really awesome Teochew food but not the easiest place to get to by public transport. You probably need to drive there but it's worth it. Atmosphere is good and food is even better, especially their braised duck"

plum n salty vegetables in steam fish/ chicken, a grade above. But expect to spend a bit above the average resturant prices"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdWJhOXpnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Nov 2020. Another birthday celebration leveraging on JUMBO's J$. Teochew cuisine had always been one of my favourite Chinese culinary dominations. Ordered Pomfret, Tofu in Crab meat, Pig Trotter Terrine etc.
The staff were cold though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bU9XZFRBEAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"The food was excellent! Impressively done by the chef, and as far as Chinese food goes, especially during crowded festive season, they sure maintain a high standard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbkxqalB3EAE,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,5,"Delicious food. Asparagus is a must order. Fried meesuah is superb! Braised duck, especially the sauce, was yummy with rice. Braised tofu was fresh and tasty. Abalone recommended. Ngoh hiang the five spice taste is too strong, so only order if you like it strong. Pomfret fish is very fresh but tastes bland. Cai po fried kway teow was overcooked, too bitter as it was cooked beyond the wok hey stage. Oyster omelette was good. Appetiser tea was great. Salted egg prawns were brilliant and a must order too. Would come back again to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpX09DSDVBRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,"Great place to bring parents & families who love good quality chinese food. The place is known for their ""orh lua"" and cold crab 👍 If you're into desserts, try out the bird nest served in almond & coconut (pretty interesting and palatable!). Overall great service, highly recommended ☺️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDhiVnNnRRAB,Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine 醉花林品潮轩,4,Nice place having lunch with business partner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM1AyeDJ3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"From review, this restaurant seems good so here we are to try.

Indeed the food is good and not crowded too:)

A lot of variety towards the food:)

Most importantly, a good chance to chit chat with family:)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3NINVNBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,3,"I was there with my family for the dinner ala carte buffet. The variety of dishes though not considered extensive, was pretty ok as the dishes were Chinese tzi char type and you won't aim to eat every single one 😅

I like it that the serving size is small, but just enough for the number of diners indicated. This allows us to order a particular dish again if we really like it and not to forcefully finish everything if it doesn't suit our taste buds. It also allows us to try out more of their dishes too without getting full just eating a couple.

There were a couple of dishes that I particularly like...eg fried hot fun and the fried fish. The rest were just very average and some coffee shop tzi char stalls have better to offer.

Service wise was slow, except for the first round of one time order dishes, the rest took a long time to be served and certain dishes were never served despite us having to keep checking with the serving staff. Most of the staff were friendly and responsive, with the exception of one who was pretty rude, and wasn't very willing to top up the tea or take any new orders, but was always busy walking around.

Though pricing wise, it may appear to be lower than many other restaurants serving buffets (note that tea and wet tissues are charged separately), overall I doubt I will be back in a long time as food is just average and nothing memorable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNFpuUkdBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,2,"This is our first visit, u need to be extremely patient when ordering ala carte buffet. Food portion was nice and small(i.e. 2 person gets 2 piece of prawn and so on) so no wastage. However U have to wait for like 1-1.5 hr for the food to be served. I don't know if it's a norm at this restaurant but seriously we were there from 11:30 til 2:30, some dishes we ordered st 12 noon just got served at 2:10 just now and we told them we are full and it got served too late so they took them back to the kitchen.
With the bill add up to about $190 for 4 adults I think next time we'll just go to Silk restaurant instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGJlQjdnRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Definitely value for money type of place.
Food is not bad, average but most buffets are like this - you go for quantity and not quality.
Value - for less than $40, u get abalone, shark’s fins, steamed fish, fried fish, decent sized prawns and whole lots of other choices.
Service - great people. Very attentive and really wanting you to have a good time. Staff are very stressed as it was very busy that day that I was there, but they still tried their best to accommodate. Food serving is rather slow, probably due to the crowd.
My family had a great time. Thanks for hosting us today."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHQ2SWx3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Food portion is small and cold. Waiting time for food is damn long. Food taste is horrible. Not worth to try. Overall, worst experience.  Even a plain roti prata taste better than all the dish served!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2M3RtME5BEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Compared to other Chinese restaurants (eg: Tunglok, Peach Garden), I would say this restaurant beats them all in terms of the quality of the food served and service provided. My whole family enjoyed our dinner buffet where we were impressed with most of the dishes and left with a full and happy stomach.😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aTVIZDBnRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Had dinner buffet with my family last Saturday. Worst experience ever. Thought of giving this a try even though the reviews were not good. There's only around 7 tables for buffet and some tables I believe it's under the tour group tables (set meals mostly I observe) but the staff arrangements is so disorganized! The supervisor or is it manager I am not sure,keep giving instructions to the waitresses but this particular waitress probably new, keep serving the wrong dishes to the tables and she accidentally knocked over the hot tea at our table which thankfully didn't scalded my dad.After the first round of the 7 dishes(served one time only) second round onwards they just keep forgetting about us. Until I had to asked the manager /supervisor then they serve our dishes out. One of the kitchen server ( she's not in uniform but white t shirt) came out and saw our table is empty and said oh dear I will check for you with the kitchen.One of the fried dishes was cold when my folks bite on it,another dish was the long beans and was already very soggy(""old veg"" not my words,but the supervisor/manager's )  At $46.80++ the menu is not extensive and some of the dishes are not served even though we asked again. So tired of waiting and chasing after our food. The food is nothing to shout about and seriously is it because it is buffet so we shouldn't be requesting our food to be serve warm and cooked nicely?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0lfcVlnEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,4,"There were in total at least 8 dishes including the dessert (Mango sago)
The food was tasty, though abit inclined towards salty side. Overall the food is delicious 😋😋😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyN19PZi1BRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"OMG!! Went at 6pm, the first batch of food served at around 1.5-2hrs later. After we went off around 9pm, 3 of us were not even 3 quarter full. Reached home & ate tibits some more. This is really too much!! Being a restaurant at hotel, the quantity & quality of food should not be like this. I thought that the chefs are really very busy cooking so by right, the food should be very hot when served, right? but surprisingly the food are cold??!! What happened? Some more the taste is not flavourful. In my perspective, I have got feeling that the restaurant direction is… you, customers come in, welcome you, being seated, my premise is big enough, you wait for your food to be served, I have plenty of time, but I’m not sure if you have the time, I will serve the food very slowly, if you cannot wait, please settle the payment & proceed to the door. As for the food, for instance, crispy fish skin, obviously it is purchased from outside & not prepared by the restaurant. When asked for another plates, they told you… no more Liao. To be frank lah, anyone wants to treat ne to the restaurant again, thank you and I will say NO! Can you imagine, went for buffet & yet, eat until no full. Si buay ke lian"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaEtHRHd3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,Unable to choose portion size. Its a buffet but portion size is fixed by number of pax. Some of the food taste stale. Not worth the price and poor experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNza0tXT0NREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,2,"Horrible service staffs.
After the 4th dish, there was an unexplained 1 hour interval. When the final 2 dishes and dessert arrived, the table was a mess. After I took some noodle, the service staff asked if they can clear the table then they just proceed.
The food was below average. Suckling was dried and hard.

The only thing acceptable was the red bean pan cake. Not too sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBelBPOTV3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Food is awesome. And service is fantastic. It's really good for family gathering or reunion with friends. Ambience is good. They have a karaoke system for a great time. Wide variety of food to choose from. We ordered fried mantou too. Thumbs up!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOU1XNnh3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,4,"The food is very fresh especially the fish and prawn is good.
We find the taste is just nice, not salty or the msg.
Is good to give them support and help them to pull through tis tough time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydm9IOUJREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Will give 0 star if its possible.. see the review 5 stars so when ahead to try their ala carte buffet, but then to my horror, food taste horrible, food is all reheat, it was so hard to eat as in literally solid hard food that it is inconvenient for my parent (which is elderly) to eat.

Order their duck meat and worst, is was still raw,which then i told their manager, female waitress which wore a blazer. She just reply ""Oh we cut out from the peking duck."" and walk away, but so what? it is still raw!!!!  It was so bad that even if free i wouldnt go back.

If you are considering to bring your family or friend over, can just forget it. there are plenty more buffets or resturant are cheaper and taste way better then their. Dont get bluffed by the 5 stars review. who knows if it their own people

No photo provided as i wouldnt want to review but the more i think, i feel that this have to be reviewed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnM3YnZRRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Went to this Happy joy restaurant yesterday night for the 2nd time with my family for the buffet alacarte. The food was nice and worth it for $39.80++ in hotel atmosphere. Restaurant was big and serving was good.There was an event held at happy joy restaurant therefore we need to wait for our 2rd round serving about 15-20mins.But it's OK,as we understand the crowds and nowadays traditional restaurant are only a few now and now things are very expensive and we are surprised that they never even increased their price.Keep it up Happy joy restaurant 😀"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybjhLRnR3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,Went on 1st May.  Manager say chef is struggling to cook the food . Took approx every half hour to serve 1 dish at a time but the food came is cold and horrible. By the closing time cannot feel at least half full. Feel like been cheated. Blacklist big time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybl9lM3VnRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Just had my buffet dinner yesterday with my family.The restaurant was full and the staff explained to us that the food will be slightly slow as there are walk in and events going on.My family decided to wait and surprisingly the staffs were also doing their best to speed up our food.Will definitely support them again with their coming set menu.

My suggestion is to go somewhere else."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOExudzN3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,3,"It's quite an old establishment. When we went there, there was some event going on and book the whole place and no restaurant reception so we found it strange and confusing since we also booked a table for family reunion dinner. After much trouble, they allocated us to rooms behind. Not a good start. Food was normal. Service was normal. Will I come again? Probably not."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNGVIZ1ZBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Probably my first & last time eating @this restaurant. Had dinner last night, sad to say, the restaurant was unable to cope with the promotions. Observed some customers started to complain on food serve not hot, flow is slow and potion is miserable. Some even left without waiting for the 2nd round of order.😢"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvci0zRF9nRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,4,One of oldest Chinese restaurant in Singapore.  Foods are delicious and reasonably priced. Service staff are friendly and helpful too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1lfS1dnEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Miserable food, lousy taste, extremely small portion and poor service. Takes more than 20 mins on average to serve up a dish.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOWFlQUNREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Apparently Mr T**** L** likes to remove and delete comments from their facebook page. So i’ll write my reviews here. Had dinner for pax of 5 on 21st march 7pm.
our table rejected almost every food that was served to our table because it was cold. Even the fried food, when questioned the staff say ""oh fry alrdy but maybe never serve so become cold"" another said "" fried food is already pre-fried beforehand. once theres an order the chefs will fry again thn serve. maybe chef forget to fry and just serve like that"" another said,
“Aiya u know usually chef see alot of order they just want to clear fast maybe forget”

Paid additional for the peking duck. no issue on the skin but the remaining duck meat which was served seperately after was bad. it was cold. whats worse is BEFORE the staff could ask me whats wrong he saw the duck and said this ""oh i know the duck was left there for quite sometime"" i will go make hot for you.

We left soon after and didnt bother to finish the duck. What was suppose to be a birthday celebration didnt turn out to be a celebration at all."

Dishes are all cooked upon order and are zichar classics.Dishes all come in tasting portions so you have a chance to order from the wide range of dishes. Highly recommended. No photos this time as was too busy eating. 😄
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcGVmS19RRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Talk about kicking it old school and going through a timewarp.. dang...

The service is great. Food is delish.
But really like timetravelling lol"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNzZtTklREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Plenty of items served in suitable small quantity.  Dishes are good and comparable to other reputable restaurants.  Price for the CNY buffet lunch is reasonable.  Service is good too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOVlMdndRRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"The comments only for their ala carte buffet.
1st the planning of siting is very bad as the place is big but alot of empty table in between so the server had to run the whole place to send the food , even worst can see that they are under staff.

2nd Waited 20min before they take in our order .After our 1st order , waited another 25 min before 1st dish was serve. Then was told that the signature items they forget to key in n had to wait again....

3rd Beside their signature items all other dish was serve cold (room temperature food plus in Aircon room). Really feel that the Zi char in coffee shop will taste better than most of the food .

Lastly can see alot of ppl was complaining and there was 2 table that left eating halfway saying that they will still paid . (Had been waiting for more than an hour and only 1/3 of their food serve.

Btw this was on the 1st of Jan Saturday dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdkxfOURBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"Unbelievably slow and dissatisfied with service provided. 90% of the food arrived was cold and service is extremely slow. Despite good reviews in the papers, service is below average and disgraceful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWQ2RGNREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Good value and delicious ala carte buffet with generous portions. Seeing previous reviews, they have stepped up and the food was served to us hot and fast. Star of the menu got to be the soon hock fish, ee fu noodle and the sharks fin. Our table of 5 never stopped eating. Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLXN5bHlBRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,2,Had ala carte buffet dinner. Service and ambient are decent. But most of the food is cold. Signature dishes are so-so. There are many coffeeshop Tze Char taste much better than this restaurant. Totally not recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX092RnZRRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"1) Ala carte buffet with super long waiting time for your order.
2) Food portion small (Example 5pax = 5 prawns per order)
3) Bad customer services from manager to staffs
4) Totally not recommended
5) Totally waste people money and time
6) The worst restaurant ever been."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanNtTXJBRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,3,"$39.80++ (min 3 pax) for the Ala-Carte Buffet, you can eat till you drop, but quality wise it is just average, noting to Woh or Wah about it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHA2WnJ3RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"The service is extremely bad. Food is atrocious, every dish comes out not even hot. Worse kind of food I’ve ever had in life. Highly not recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NC1EdWdBRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,3,"Was having reunion dinner
Tables were spaciously spaced apart and comfortable seating,
Baby friendly seat and utensils provided
Food was fresh but portions were small.
Dishes were served at long intervals
Was amazed at how my tea was not refilled a single time during the 2 hours seating"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycnVVNBAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Buffet food are yummy and delicious.very reasonable price and good service .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaExPVmhnRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,4,Good worthy food. Great taste and excellent service.  Keep it up!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbTdTeFlnEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Had the buffet which is very worth it. The taste the portion all excellent.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcHV2clFREAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Good service and traditional feel and taste! Old traditional restaurants are always more tasty compared to those new modern types. Had a good birthday celebration for my dad. Highly recommended
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdmM2RFNBEAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"i have never been to this restaurant or hotel. However, recently, i need to organise a little gathering in this vicinity. Happy Joy came up in the search. So i took a gamble. Ah Heng has been absolutely professional and helpful, not only in the arrangements, but his recommendations for ordering of food. The coffee pork ribs and the fried egg white scallops turned out to be really superb. The cuisine is Cantonese and though the pricing appeared steep initially but the servings is pretty substantial. Am glad to find another awesome restaurant in the vicinity. Thank you, Ah Heng!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcG9mWl93RRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,"Now with the pandemic and looking where to bring my parent for dinner? I know my parent will love this traditional chinese restaurant since their relocation from Bukit Merah to Newton. I didn't know until my parent told me Happy Joy almost 40 years in the market! Comfortable dining as tables are spread a distance away and don't feel crowded. I called to make reservation and understand that their buffet dinner at $39.80 per pax, promo 4 free 1 promotion until end of June. It's an absolute steal for this price! I will be back soon.
What can we ask for with this price that includes peking duck, abalones, shark fin, superior treasure pot, soon hock fish and more...Great food, great price and indeed great nice people in the restaurant.

The staff is helpful and sent me their set menu with mini birthday buns, I will be back for my dad 70th birthday!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMzZqamhBRRAB,Happy Joy Restaurant,1,"bad service, long waiting time for food. leave customers unattended. those who came later was being served first."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NW9xSkV3EAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,2,"Just visited today @ 7 May 16 (7pm-9pm). Foods is good.

Service is disappointed on the last part during bill payment. They have counted wrongly for my bill.

When I seek clarification on the bill. The lady staff insisted the bill is right even we pointed out the mistake.

No choice we have to ask the manager who taken our order to verify. We are right n correct.

The lady stuff show No sense of remorsefulness, No apologize and No smile.

Just pass back us the corrected amount of Bill and walk away. Just like pass money to begger.

Totally disappointed.

Very unhappy customer"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ2F1TkV3EAE,Happy Joy Restaurant,5,Good and delicious food at very affordable price....
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybkkzWnZ3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Place is a bit of a mini disaster when it comes to service. It does have enough staff who seems genuinely nice, but they all run around like headless chickens. Orders take forever to come after multiple checks with staff, and the place wasn’t even too packed. Food is nondescript and portion sizes are pathetic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeDlxUmdBRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,4,"Tables are limited and luckily, I went there after lunch and managed to have a seat. Nice selection of food to choose from. Enjoyed my late lunch."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bnZXOTNnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,4,"A small eatery serving Putien, Nanyang, and some local specialties such as hainanese chicken rice. Service was good and fast. Staff are friendly and patient. The place is small and a little cramp. Very open and near shoppers passing by. Ordered the Putien Lor Mee, kang kong, crispy baby squid and xiao long pau. Food was reasonably ok. The xiao long pau was good but I've had better. The squid was crispy but packed the semi sweetness it needs. Noodles and veg were good. Tasty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNm9TT3BnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,4,Come here for dinner. Pretty good place for Xinghua cuisine. Simple and nice. All dishes that ordered are good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbmV5ZHl3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Came with a 10-month old baby, the staff was able to give us a corner table and baby chair. Food was hot and nice portion. Staff was friendly too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydzhEdGtnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,3,"French toast was good.
Others r ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOXFHMy1nRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Yummy! The pork rib soup is nice. Herbal taste just taste great. Fried yam is great too. Really like it. Worth coming back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLWJXS1ZnEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,3,"Ambience wise nothing to shout about .
Order the fried tengiri , do eat when freshly fried else the fishy odor comes out .

Xing hua fried bee Hoon and stewed toufu was nice ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1em9IWURBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,2,"We tried the outlet at Novena and was disappointed with the food served except for the cold dish appetite, pork slices which is surprisingly tender and the sauce combines well with meat. The beef rendang was tough and the tofu kai lan was salty. Rice was not properly cooked as well. They appeared to be short of staff, and food takes quite a while to be served. The seating area is quite cramped as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX1l2emdnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Service was really slow, even if it is lunch hour, I don't find it acceptable. Order taking was fast but I had to wait near to half an hour for my food to be ready. I ordered Yuan yang too, this Yuan Yang tasted like water. I think I can make better tasting instant coffee than this 🙄 FYI they use a drinks machine to dispense the coffee/Yuan yang and what not. Counter clerk did not even say thanks upon collecting payment. I need my Yuan yang from Xing wang right now!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNy1xeDN3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Both of us have been loving their food since we first patroned tiong bahru mall outlet. My second time trying out at Novena Velocity outlet and they have even more varieties! Yummy food and drinks at affo|Singapore prices! Recommended their fried rice, xinghua beehoon, garlic cucumber, teh c and kopi c😍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeTVIOHh3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Quality Xing Hua food at affordable prices, food servings were just like their other outlets. Service was well trained and had celebrated our gathering successfully. Definitely to come here again soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGJQM1pBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,4,First time dining there last Thursday and it was a wonderful experience because all the (aunties and uncle) staff were polite and I felt that they provided a better service than many waiters and waitresses at a lot of the restaurants my family and I had been to in Singapore. We had a toddler with us and the staff were patient despite him dropping some things on the floor a few times. They also came over a few times to check on our toddler and to play with him. The food was delicious and portion size was fine except for the Bian Rou dumpling soup as it the dumplings were pretty small and there was very little vegetables in it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMy1fRUtBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"First time trying their food. Ordered a pork chop fried rice, both the fried rice and pork chop is tasteless. Wok hey easily taste so much better. And they charge 50 cents for a regular take away box. Take your money somewhere else."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTRUTXZRRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,2,The lor mee was nice as described. Never order drinks from there especially Milo and coffee. My children ordered Milo and I saw the staff making out from 3in 1 packet and it was very diluted. The staff told me that the coffee was from the coffee machine and hence I didn't order. But she didn't tell with regards to the Milo. I should have guessed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNGJUdlF3EAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"The clams soup and yam are so yummy. We queried why the clams soup did not come with vegetables as stated in the menu, the chef and manager came over to verify and gave us a new bowl... Very caring and conscientious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMHNuRXB3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,3,"Food is actually good, and there are some decent staff who are genuinely nice. But avoid coming at peak periods they cannot handle the crowd. Food takes forever to come. Clearly forgot one of my orders when a dumplimg soup took 40mins to come - way after everything else was served. If you are in a rush for lunch, you will not make it back in 1hr."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX3RfdFFnEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,4,"Service is efficient, dishes served quickly especially at peak lunch hour. Heng Hwa bee hoon tasty, though a little too oily, and has sufficient ingredients and condiments added. Stir fried razor class gong bao style was enjoyable as they were willing to tone down the spice. Bian rou soup was alright though not very impressive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cy1fY0VREAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Giving 1 star for the soup dish @ 18.90. Supposed to be Chinese cabbage, clams and taufu soup. No Chinese cabbage at all. Ingredients are so little. DO NOT order the soup dish. Order those lor mee and fried mee Hoon is much better. Wasted trip, money and time 😞"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X3FMWThnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Meticulous service with tasty heng hwa food! Mum and I enjoyed our lunch tremendously. Heng Hua lor mee was cooked well and tasty. The peranakan stir-fry veg was cooked well with wok hei and had yam bits! Fried fish is crispy and nice. Thank you.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWRLTFdBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,Worst meal ever! The Chicken was ice cold and the 酸辣粉 was no where near anything I have eaten before (and I spent 17 years living in China)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbGVyRkx3EAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Affordable meals and tasty lor mee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeV82WjN3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Horrendous dining experience, do not order their drinks, Teh O ice super black and tasteless with no sugar. Their putien noodle has no taste and very little to no meat. Worst restaurant! Don't waste ur time and money here"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcV9MRFdREAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Good very yummy, a lot of varieties"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ME5qM1NBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Don't know whether they get their friends help with the Google review. Order 6pc Xiao long bao + soup spicy soup. Taste like microwave food  and even worse than kopitiam food. It costs me 18+. Very expensive. Very long waiting time although it is not peak hour.

Better to go DTF or other Chinese restaurants."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdktpNF9nRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Recommended, nice food and friendly service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOGZleHZnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,This is my first visit to Xing Hua. The first thing that attracts me is the simple but clean and bright interior. Also their variety of dishes esp the Heng Hwa bee hoon & Putian dishes are mouth watering. I was there at 4.00pm and their staff services were very friendly and professional. I will bring my family next week for lunch.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M2ZlYkZBEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Repeated visit to this restaurant for its tasty food and great service. Good food recommendations offered! Will patronise again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM09pbjJ3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Food was delicious. Customer service was friendly and excellent. It was a happy experience dining here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bnAzeWdnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Food and service exceeded my expectations. Really like their Red Wine Chicken Meesua!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHBTejd3RRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"First and last vist here for sure ! The service is atrocious, called 3 different staffs (guy with green hair, old aunty with short hair, prc lady with pony tail) at different intervals to check on my seafood noodles but none of them bothered to respond, just simply brushed me aside. We waited for almost 40 mins and my noodles is not served still. I now asked the 5th staff whom checked with the tall dark colored skin non chinese looking lady at cashier then informed us its coming. After waited for another 5 mins, the noodles just never arrived ! I was visibly super upset and proceeded to cancel order. The taste of their XLB is nothing spectacular, you are better off with DTF or Daxi @ Velocity which served better dumplings. Foods are NOT authentic Hokkien, nor authentic Putien, neither are they authentic Peranakan ! They have lost their identity, as rojak as Singapore. You have a better deal eating at real Putien franchised restaurants @ Ion, Vivo, Kitchener Rd. The taste of their food, and presentation is just about another wannabe Pu Tian, you dont even wanna see how they pack your food if you order via grab/panda, really dont even talk about service which is way below sub-par. You are definitely happier dining @ Hans or Mun Zuk porridge next door ! Spent your $$$ there at your own risk !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyazZucUJnEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,Staff absolutely have no idea what is on their menu and got me the wrong order for takeaway. Even the refund process took some time and I was not allowed a refund because the kitchen is already preparing my item. Total waste of time and ruin of appetite
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHRLajNBRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"The service staff were very polite and professional even though it was packed with customers and all the tables were full

The food was served hot and it was delicious with many varieties of Putien and Hokkien cuisines to choose from."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPamFYMFlnEAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,"Overpriced and food quality is bad, their xiao long bau and siew mai taste like some frozen section products and re-sell it to customers at a higher price. Would not come back again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPamNMSDlRRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Awesome food. The marinated clams were really tasty, n their signature bee hoon was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPZ00tT1hREAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,Very yummy beehoon. Well fried. Truffle mushrooms were very tasty. Exquisite pork buns. Good service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPamV1aWdBRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"This is my sec time here, I enjoyed the food very much, service is very good, I would like to come back here again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbW9PNzJnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"Good, affordable Hokkien style dishes. Had the red wine mee sua - perhaps one of the few stores in Singapore that does this dish properly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHBINzBRRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,really did not disappoint me the food is delicious and the service style is very enthusiastic❤❤❤❤
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnBuWUJ3EAE,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,1,Agree with other reviews that this restaurant is a disaster in the service. All staff ran around and didn’t reply when checking on the order. Not sure if they don’t care or just plain rude. One bowl of noodle took more than half hour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHZXWjRnRRAB,Xing Hua at Novena Velocity,5,"good ambience and fast serving . The menu is wide spread , love the yam and bee Hoon ,lor men."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMFppbER3EAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,2,"Not good. Not bad. Just very average. Definitely overpriced for what it is.

Two things entertained me about this place:

1) We overheard a young girl telling her father “This food is disgusting” - that cracked me up. Her father and I exchanged a chuckle.
2) The restaurant is for some reason using a large amount of space, right next to where the customers are sitting, to store boxes. It just looks funny! Attached a picture to illustrate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtXzYtS0h3EAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,2,"Quality of food had gone down. The tomato egg dish is horrible. Price is high.... Soup is not hot and too sweet. The first 2 dishes came quite timely, the last 2 dishes were served 25 minutes later. Not a good dining experience. Not recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycTc3ZmFBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,3,"Nice tasty and reasonably priced food, service staff rushing you to finish quickly;
Almost feels like being chased away by telling you ""we want to leave the restaurant by 930pm"""
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ1lDdlNBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Had dinner at the United Square outlet. Great food and even better service. All the staff that served us were polite and helpful - if only all restaurants and service staff were like this. My wife requested for a knife to cut the sautéed broccoli we ordered as she found the pieces too big to chew. Even though they didn't have a knife, the manager kindly offered to bring our broccoli back to the kitchen and to have them all cut into smaller pieces. And all done with a smile. It was a very pleasant dinner and we'll definitely be eating here again soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azh5OWRnEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Awesome Samsui Chicken. Visited 2 decades ago, tasted the same. Except the ginger paste slightly less salted. Well done."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhLVBLNFVBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,Value for money set lunch. $12.90++ with a choice of rice bowl and a soup. Top up $3 for dessert and a tea. Service was great and friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXFyOExREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"This is overall my family's favourite Soup Restaurant outlet. Taste and quality of the dishes are consistently good, and the restaurant managers Bobo and Joanna Choong are always warm, friendly, attentive and accommodating. Their service is top-notched. Highly recommended for a cosy delicious family meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c3ZpNGZBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,2,"Servicewise, still excellant. However,their samsui chicken is now very tasteless and texture is just wrong. Not half as addictive as before and i lost interest completely after eating the 2nd piece..even dunking it in the ginger sauce didnt help any.
The medium size ah por fan shu vegetable was very small in portion as well,and was limpid and bland tasting..
Their specialty hometown tofu had no special taste nor texture to it,and their fish slices with ginger were insipid and tasteless.
My all time favourite of olive fried rice was clumpy and yet superbly oily.
I have been a long time fan of their brand but i m beginning to think if i should revisit and revise this fact.
Paid quite a lot for this bill and yet went away feeling pretty shortchanged and disillusioned with the meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1em92OUR3EAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,3,"Individual set meal of ginger chicken rice portion was small. Individual set of sweet sour pork rice was sufficient, the chrysanthemum drink that came with the set was super diluted like water. Old cucumber soup n cordycep soup were just average. Will not order again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaU91dGpBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,Britney is a cheerful staff and she has a wonderful memory. She got all our orders correct even without writing them down. Fast on her feet and courteous.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dHREN1JnEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Super love their partnership with Grab, where you're able to order on the Grab app and picking the food up afterwards. The samsui ginger chicken is definitely a house favourite, but also their fried baby kai lan with tong kwai. Had a food-takeaway done from this Restaurant, to enjoy the food at the comforts of my home. Especially love the ginger scallion sauce! Even ordered extra box of that for the next day."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUxXRjlBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"The staff at the restaurant are outstanding. I have known regulars like Ms Leong Tai Yoke for more than 20 years and the service has always been excellent and friendly.
Soup Restaurant serves comfort food at its best. I will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjVUMDR3RRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Extremely happy with the service served by Mdm Leong Tai Yoke.
She advised us not to under nor over order when we decided to go for the set lunch; as a result we ordered 3 pax set though we have 4 persons.
She’s also quick to help us to clean up our table and asked us if there’s anything we need and if we are happy with the serving and service.
Aunty Leong 加油 - we applaud for your service. Btw, she’s also very 亲切。"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLUpMY0dnEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Very enjoyable meal in a clean well managed restaurant with lovely friendly staff. We had  ginger chicken, fried rice and a couple of other vegetable dishes, all delicious 🙌"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHQ3cERREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,1,"Very overpriced for this range and quality. This particular branch’s food quality is exceptionally poor. Chicken is dry, venison tough, food and tea is not warm enough. Service also lacking. Disappointed. Not the usual soup restaurant standards."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWMzaGhnRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,Service crew has always went above and beyond to ensure a good dining experience.Food quality is good. Highly recommended!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnZ1pURnBnRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,Great samsui chicken and hearty Chinese herbal soups. Perfect for family dinners and a cosy get together. Food often consistent. Queues expected on weekends.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMF9IMkJREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,I have always received excellent service from Bo Bo. She is very knowledgeable and polite in her work.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdHFXZFNnEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,3,"Food was decent. Ordered the Salted Egg Chicken with Fries Rice set lunch. The chicken was yummy, the fried rice was a little bland, and they gave a lot of rice (like 2 persons portion). Had to wait a long time for the soup (soup of the day) and my food to come. Quite surprised by the wait cause usually set lunches allow restaurants to narrow down the food preparation and serve quickly."

The store manager also did her best to arrange the dishes in a way that suits our style. Lastly, one of male staff attended to our needs every now and then.
Really customized service!
The ambience of the restaurant is great too, where a section actually faces a garden.
Overall, great experience!!"

The manager is also very friendly and even guided my father-in-law to the taxi stand as he had trouble walking.

Will definitely recommend this outlet to my friends for the customer service provided."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeDhhclpREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,"Soup restaurant is situated inside United Square mall in Novena area. We have 4 adults seated inside the corner cubicle. Their famous chicken, tofu and sea cucumbers with mushrooms are recommended. Their soups are slightly salty. Overall we enjoy a good dinner there."

Food quality is declining"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cWZiR0RnEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,the cadyceps (?) soup was the highlight. very very good. the rest not too memorable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeF8tdjhRRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,their samsui chicken still as good and quite a Q to wait during dinner time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeWM3dVNBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,2,The wait time between dishes during the dinner is an absolutely disappointing experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTb3ByLW93RRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,2,"The chicken, soup and toufu were tasty although on the pricey side. However, before the meal, i discovered a cockroach in my Pu Er tea. When we told the staff, we did not even get an apology. Well, you won’t see us back there anytime soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdXB2OGdBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,Quite a long wait for the food. Seem a little short handed and the service staff seem flustered. All items were delicious though!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjVEejlBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Famous local steamed chicken with ginger and lettuce to wrap it or with steamed rice. Nice try and the steamed minced pork with salted fish also taste delicious.Very good selections of food, also with a good service. I was accompanied by a local colleague speaking Chinese so I have no idea if English would be a problem. Anyway, nothing to complain, I recommend it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeDVhZjZRRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,1,"I ordered the traditional soup of the day, on a Friday which was stated to be Lotus root soup. However when it arrived they gave us a different soup without informing us. When I questioned the manager about it she told me that they do not need to inform customers about changes of the soup of the day and that nothing would be done to rectify the situation and that i would still have to pay. On top of that she was rude about the situation and she asked me multiple times if i ‘understood’ the situation and what was going on. Poor service and average food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNajYzenRBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Soup Restaurant is one of our favourite places for family gathering. Along with the popular Samsui Ginger Chicken, soupy dish like the Baby Spinach with Century Egg, and the ""wok-hei"" Hometown Fried Fish Belly are our best-loved. Menu was designed to order the food in one glance and get it served quick. Very cheerful group of service crew. Like the traditional dining tables that come in different shapes and sizes. Special thanks to Jonathan for the birthday cake preparation and related services. Well done!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNdWJhMklBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"This popular chain restaurant never fails to impress with its Samsui Ginger Chicken. In fact, every table had the dish on it. Spread the chopped ginger on the succulent and tender chicken pieces, wrap them with lettuce leaves and we have ourselves a bite of its signature dish. The order taker was very helpful in recommending a few dishes once we told her of our dietary requirements. The Claypot Salmon could do with a little less salt, but that is just my opinion. Service was efficient with our chrysanthemum tea constantly being refilled."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJOU5PbU5BEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,"Soup Restaurant @ united is pretty good. The staff there are quite service pro esp the uncle but it is chaotic on busy nites. Food is tasty and consistant. You can eat big as in group or many dishes or small but be prepared to order double or triple portions for a group as some dishes are small ones. Any soup of the day is fine by me and if you're hungry the full platter of white/steamed chicken slices will help fill you up easy, I love the ginger paste it comes with. The steamed minced meat with salted egg n water chestnuts is a winner in my books."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdV9YNFZREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,"The signature samshui chicken was succulent and as always, its standard was maintained. Tried a new dish, the Ah Po Ginger fried rice. The amount of ginger was just nice and the rice was fragrant. The claypot tofu deserves a try too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMmJfcVJBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Ordered the set for 3 (although there's 4 of us) with soup, Samsui chicken, fried rice, potato leaves in sambal, tofu and dessert. Great meal at reasonable price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRc1B6UGtBRRAB,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,"Tasty food that feels home made at reasonable pricing.

Love the samsui chicken, eggplant claypot, broccoli with mushroom and beancurd skin and deep fried fish belly. Nothing lacking on food at all.

The service was also very prompt. The cashier somehow remembered my name at my second visit, which was impressive. The staff is also responsive and attentive to your requests.

Definitely a place to return for many years ahead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBc0p5aGFBEAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,5,Consistently good Chinese food! The Samsui chicken with a generous portion of ginger and lettuce wraps is a must have. Also good is their selection of soups and claypot rice dishes. I really liked the steamed minced pork with water chestnut as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aGRHMlhREAE,Soup Restaurant 三盅两件 @ United Square,4,"The service is excellent, food arrived quick & timely.  Love the signature chicken dish...it is to die for.  The only trouble, the price is a little steep."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldjhDVzRnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch, was crowded. We order our usual dishes. Food was not bad but the rice lack the fragrance which it used to have. Something might be missing. Surprisingly, other outlets rice tasted differently from this particular Thomson outlet. Hopefully, the rice can be improved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlZ042T2lnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"I would give 6 stars if I could. This place is mind blowing good. I guess it’s the curry fish curry and chicken rice rice combo for me. Everything else was the supporting cast because those 2 just stole the show in my mouth.

Nonetheless I enjoyed every other dish as well. Will be back if I have curry fish head and chicken rice cravings!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnZmWTFBRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,2,"I was very disappointed with my visit today which was a stark difference from my last visit a few years back.

The single and most important part of chicken rice has got to be the rice. What we got was a plate of undercooked rice that was bland as well. The roast chicken wasn't any better as the meat tasted dry and overcooked.

The Kang Kong and hot plate tofu were decent and the saving grace of our dinner was probably the prawn roll. Service standards didn't do them a favour either. Don't think I'll be back here anytime soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcE91S19RRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"This is the first time I got here. For lunch, it's better you go before the lunch time, example 11 a.m. So you don't have to que.

I ordered:
1. BBQ Pork Dumpling Set
2. Roasted Pork Vegetable Set

For restaurant, the price is affordable. And for the meal, it's delicious."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLTh6a0hREAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"We found this place was fairly well rated and their pics looked pretty good too, soo we ventured out to give it a go - boy, we were so happy we did!!
.
The decor isn’t like super insta-flashy or anything but that made it appeal even more to us as a place that just did good food well 👍🏻
.
We were surprised they did crabs 🦀 as well so definitely had to give them a go too. We ordered:
~ 2x Singapore Chilli Crabs
~ Whole Hainan Chicken
~ BBQ pork
~ Belachan Kang Kong
.
Let’s start with the crab. It was amazing! Loads of roe, meaty and the sauce was epic. It was perfect to soak up with the fried mantou (buns). Luckily we got 2 cos we completely demolished them (probably could have done another 2 lolol 😏🤭)
.
The chicken was good too, most of it was super tender, just a few breast pieces that were a touch on the “well cooked” side but overall tasted great 👍🏻
.
The kang kong veggies were super yummy too. Love eating these kinds of veggie dishes in Asian countries cos it’s super inexpensive but very very yummy and full of wokchi 🔥🔥
.
A lovely place that we’re glad we tried out and to our surprise had amazing crabs 🦀 as well as the chicken 🐓"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2R6eVlREAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,2,"As I live fairly nearby, my family and I used to patronised its outlet that was located along Thomson Road.

Ever since it shifted to United Square, we have not try.

We came this afternoon and there was a Q. We waited in line for about 10 mins and was ushered to our table.

We ordered:

1. Chicken for 2pax
2. Mixed Roast pork & Char Siew
3. Prawn roll (small)
4. Sambal Kang Kong
5. Dumpling soup (6 pcs)
6. 1 plain rice
7. 1 chicken rice

Total damage: $54.15

Food reviews (subject to personal taste):

1. Normal chicken - doesn't give me the smooth texture or tasted succulent. Cucumber not even whole slices but within the big slice, sliced up even more

2. Roast pork tip didn't have that crunch which was disappointing. Char siew was little chunky sliced up and not much of charred flavour

3. Prawn Roll dish was decent for me

4. Sambal Kang Kong came out extremely salty and had to send back to change another. When returned 2nd time, it was still salty. Staff shared with sambal is such and is salty. We didn't want to comment much as for those who cook, is the amount of sauce/salt that a chef adds. Thus is adjustable.

5. Dumpling soup was decent
7. Chicken rice didn't capture the essence of chicken stock(if they use to cook)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cThLa2lnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Recommended by son, as I have not heard of this chicken rice before. (I am not a chicken rice fan)
And was surprised with the high rating. So we went with high expectations.
Rice was fragrance and came quite a small portion.
The roasted chicken meat was soft and tender. The sauce was too sweet for my liking.
At least there are some dishes that we can order beside eating chicken meat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPME0zcDBnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"Price has been up abit. Dinner for 2 pax $33 max full, chicken taste same as most other foods hawker centre. Kang kong very nice but $9 is expensive, sambal very nice. Dumpling soup nothing special to me. Place very warm traditional style, good for family weekend dinning."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMXZtRjFnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"Wee Nam Kee is a well known Hainanese Chicken Rice restaurant that also serves other Chinese dishes in its menu. However it’s really known more for its authentic and delicious Hainanese Chicken Rice. The chicken is tender, juicy, fragrant and cooked to perfection. The rice is also just right, not too oily and has enough flavor and fragrance. A Chicken drumstick set includes choice of steamed oyster vegetable (Kailan) and/or pork dumplings. I opted for both! The set also comes with either lemon tea or barley (choice of hot or cold). Superb! 4/5!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbW9UTjJRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"They got the order wrong. We got the normal chicken breast instead of drumstick. The breast meat was dry. BBQ pork was red and not charred enough  However the rice and chili were on the spot for us. Veg cooked perfectly. Can skip the dumplings. If you come in a group, order their other ala cart dishes. Taste good on ours and looks good on tables across"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleTc3NVJnEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,2,"Missed the traditional old taste although it is getting pricey. Service is getting worse. Arrived at 7.30pm, wanted to order chicken drumstick but was told unable to do so unless I order half chicken. Curry fish head is too salty as well. Sambal kangkong is at $9.10 for a very small plate. Hope to see better service and improve taste in the future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMmVYQThRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"Prices has gone up abit, but I guess that's happening everywhere. The chicken rice set (be it dumpling soup or vege set) are now $10.50 but a drink (barley or lemon tea) is added to it. Food standards still good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOWRiNnJ3RRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Chicken Rice (SGD $6.40) @ Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice.
.
Founded by Wee Toon Ouut in 1987, this beloved brand is today among the most popular and accessible around, serving a good rendition along other home-style comfort food.
.
The chicken has a tender, juicy, slightly springy chew, with pleasant meaty sweet savoury flavour, enhanced with a touch of salty sweet savoury nutty notes from the gravy.
.
The poached chicken is more clean-tasting with a thin gelatinous layer beneath the slippery skin, while the equally popular roasted chicken has a faint smoky aroma and a slightly crisp skin.
.
The long-grain rice is soft and loose, gently slick but not overly greasy, with lovely grainy savoury sweet flavour. The sliced juicy cucumbers and crisp spring onions lend vegetal sweet flavour.
.
Served with dark sweet soy sauce with salty savoury sweet flavour, crushed ginger with herbal sweet spice notes, chili with spicy savoury kick, and a clear chicken broth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MDl6V1hnEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,Enjoyed the chicken rice and dishes. The chilli with ginger was fantastic. Roasted chicken meat was delicious. I usually judge the chicken rice by the soup and this was tasty too. I asked if I could top up the soup and they said yes!  I like my chicken rice with gizzard and liver and was happy to have these options. We added crabmeat omelette and prawn fritters which were yummy too. Recommended. Will be back if I need another filling of chicken rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cnN2Y2lnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,2,"With so many good reviews, i can only guess we may have ordered the wrong dishes.

Btw the even the chicken rice is lack of fragrance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdklDTHRBRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Overall Great 👍. Gong bao Ji ding was on the sweeter side. Lesser sugar
Would have been better. Rice was very good, so was barley drink"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOF9pMDRnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,Old school chicken rice restaurant. The roasted version is especially good with the sauce. The white version is very smooth.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDZTcC13RRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,2,"chicken rice overalls ok. but roast pork belly totally disappointed. taste dry, no crunchy, cold like bring out from freezer. is overnight left over. will no more next visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbWNDdjBnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"Chicken rice - The dish was good but the chicken meat was not as fleshy as before and the portion was smaller.
Dumpling soup - There were 3 dumplings, which were ok. But the soup was salty and did not have much other flavour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMW9HLUlnEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,1,"We visit this restaurant often. Cos we live nearby, They've raised 5% service charge and GST since 7th April. That's fine, but they have provided lesser portion than before. Which does not justify the implementation in service charge and gst.
Very disappointed"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eF82enRnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,When less crowded you get to enjoy more time. Being chase when there is queue. For a restaurant it is not very customer oriented place
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeV9tSkhREAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,Love steamed chicken more than roasted. Staffs are friendly and helpful.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhamRQdFlBEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,This was the menu at the Marina Square location that we went to. It all looked SO TASTY when we went to visit back in January 2020 but I couldn’t taste any of the food being so sick on that trip. Can’t wait to come back and give this place a try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dmI2TTh3RRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"A good efficient dinning place that serve good standard chicken rice and assorted food at reasonable prices. Set meal are good option for a full meal. Here the chicken is tender and sauces are on par. Dumplings soup dumplings are generous in fillings. Dining ambiance is good enough and air condition . You go , order , eat and run.  No frills."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcnFESWRnEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"Order for take away a bit uncomfortable as no menu to view and ""waiting area"" is kind of no area to wait.

Food is definately good. Will go back for the food.

Service can be improve as staff that serving food seems very tired rather than pleasant and enjoying....

Not too crowded and spacious space.

Entrance is located outside of mall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLajdMSXJnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"So so, nothing special.

Average per pax $15, acceptable range however quality dropped significantly especially the chicken itself.

Salted egg pork ribs and Sambal Sotong doesn't impress us as well, especially salted egg pork ribs a bit disappointed as other outlet at Yishun much much better taste compare with this outlet.

In overall, 3 Star for the food quality, 4 Star for the warm services and spacious environment.

Sadly to say, I won't recommend this place to others. In fact, we grave for their signature chicken but maybe, we just shouldn't pay too high expectations."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cV91NFpBEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,Still the best chicken rice in Singapore! They do also have a decent zi chat menu that offers the usual dishes you would expect with the sweat and sour pork chops and sotong you tiao that you might want to try. Good service and it’s usually quite busy in weekends.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ekxhbkNREAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"Service was good and care was taken to ensure safe distancing, hygiene and sanitising (and temperature taking). Ambience is cozy and good for family dining. Food is OK but there's a certain fishy taste in the dumplings which is not the usual typical teepo fish taste that I'm used to. Lunch that day was just a ""get stomach filled"" experience. No socks off!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bWJiVmJ3EAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,A long standing Chicken Rice establishment in the Novena area. Rice is quite good and chicken is decent taking into account the current supply constraints. Above average overall and one of the better ones around.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M016OVlBEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"We ate between lunch and dinner, so the restaurant was empty except us. The service was very quick and the chicken rice was absolutely delicious. The waiter was a little curt, which was off-putting."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3Nhbkx3EAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"The best place for chicken rice in my opinion. My kids love this place. All their dishes are good. Our fave are the roasted chicken rice, hot plate beancurd, baby kailan, fu rong omelette.. somehow this outlet's food is far better than the Northpoint outlet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNExycFdBEAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"They say one of the best Chicken Rice place. Hummm. I expect high but the outcome is below par for great chicken rice. I am not saying bad which u can see I still give 4 star. Just they cannot be regarded as best chicken rice. Their chicken is good and food is nice. Really worth to come. However for best chicken, u need some good cooking method and the tender of chicken must be smooth rather than a bit rough. Otherwise other food was also good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeExibnZ3RRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,Went with a friend from out of town who wanted to hv some chicken rice in a comfortable ie aircon setting. The chicken was tender and rice was tasty but I'm not sure I'll be back. There's too many chicken rice stalls sans a/c that taste as good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aEp5Q3ZnRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,1,"Portion is pathetic. Was given a few scraps of meat that look like leftovers from an unfinished meal.  Whats more despicable, is the raising of price without updating their menu price or informing customer (due to chicken shortage so they claimed). So disappointed as i used to frequent them in the past, but food is now mediocre with questionable bussiness practices."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd29PZXJRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Favorite chicken rice place in SG. Quality has lowered slightly since they sold to Jumbo and moved from their original location nearby but still good. The roast chicken, rice and sambal is still good"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNrX19EejVBRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,Busy but awesome spot for chicken rice with other side dishes as well. Lines up are usually pretty quick because they server fast and prices are decent for a full sit down. I usually come back here when the stalls don't cut it - enjoy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRa2FqYzhRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,This is a very busy outlet but you can be guaranteed of consistently good chicken rice that is so fragrant and chicken that melts in your mouth. The fish head curry comes recommended and I like the freshness that tasted directly from the sea. The supreme pork chops and prawn roll are tasty.  Recommended to make reservations if coming in large groups.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDLWNIdTdBRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,The rice is nice and fragrance but a bit disappointed with the chicken as they are not tender enough. The price is on the high side compare to other shops. The chilli is nice but the ginger is dry and not fragrance.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbGFEMUh3EAE,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,4,"Had a good dinner here with my family. They only had white chicken left though as we came pretty late ( around 8pm), so do come early if you're eyeing the roasted chicken or roasted pork. Ordered some sides as well,overall quite nice for the variety it has in addition to some pretty good chicken rice."

Yesterday we ordered all the good stuff I remembered and taste as well as quality wise they are still keeping up their same high level as ever before.

To my favorites belong obviously the roasted chicken, the chicken rice, their sweet and sour pork, baby kaylan with garlic and the mapo eggplant dish. All of which were support delicious. I don't know why we didn't order the bbq chashu as I remember that being fabulous too but I guess we already had more than enough food.

Wee Nam Kee still my favorite."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbGJlcnRRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"I have eaten at Wee Nam Kee for more than 10 years and I loved the chicken, the rice and the condiments. Unfortunately, this time I didn't quite enjoy the meal. Perhaps I should not say why as the taste for food is very subjective."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOWRhenpBRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Quite simply, amongst the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. And the char siew and roast pork is sublime too.

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNVpoXxAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,5,"Fast to get seated due to ample seating spaces even during lunch time today. Only about 10-15 mins to get our food after ordering.

The meal which comes with either an oyster vegetable or 3 dumplings is very good! Always order extra rice because their rice portion is smaller but their rice is so yummy. Sticky and fragrant, addictive!

Although the bill came up to $20 for two because we added extra char siew and gizzard to our chicken rice sets, it’s totally worth the money for such a satisfying meal. It’s easy to spend $20 in town on food that’s way less satisfying or quality."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtN0lMUThRRRAB,Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant,1,"Just sharing my opinion. Haven't been there for few years. Today, All food served cold. Not worth going anymore as it's totally different from years back.

Used to have second helping for the fragrance rice but it is now taste like raw flour. The Char Siew taste like you're putting sugar in your mouth as it's overlay sweet. The roast pork in the market taste way better than theirs. Ordered quarter Chicken but given all breast meat which used to be tender and tasty but not anymore.

All of the above is even more obvious when our ""lie detector"" didn't even finish half of his favourite fragrance rice 🤭"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMUpxaTBBRRAB,Sichuan Food,5,Underrated place with extremely legit and affordable Sichuan food. 烤鱼 and 辣子鸡 are must-trys!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cjV1QUlREAE,Sichuan Food,5,Foods are very good. My favorite is fish soup 👍👍 but Whampoa is one of the dirtiest food court I have seen in Singapore . Very few staff to clean tables. If they can provide better cleaning in that food center would be so good place to go.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbHJMbEVBEAE,Sichuan Food,5,Great place! I ordered the chongqing chicken. It is amazing and the amount of chicken is very generous. If you like spicy food this is your dish.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOXFhRmlnRRAB,Sichuan Food,1,"Do not visit this shop. Very poor service, did not inform about waiting time for order. Ended up waiting for an hour since refund for order was rejected. Got partial refund for order in the end. Food was not so great as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMmRqeExnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,"Went on a Friday night around 7pm and there are 1-2 seats left. Service was okay. You can order your food via QR code.

Ordered the pan fried buns, minced meat noodle and pork fillet. Pan fried buns were good though the base of the crust is rather on the thicker side. Noodle was okay nothing amazing. Pork fillet was pretty oily and didn't have much taste.

Will probably return for the pan fried buns."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0xyWFdnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,"Good for casual dinner with family .
The drunken chicken was not chilled enough and chicken were chilled into too small bits .

The noodle was ok but nothing unusual .

Fried pork on skewers was too overly sweet .
The skin of the  pan fried bun was too hard.

One major comment was after consuming dinner I was overly thirsty, too much artificial flavoring."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenFma0dnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"Decent food, but still finding their footing.

Meat noodles are satisfying and portions are generous. The chicken and beans cold dishes are so-so, the dumplings are a bit lacking in soup and meat.

They also ran out of many dishes by the time we went, but to be fair the restaurant was packed full since lunchtime and we only went for dinner.

Hopefully in the future they will have more dim sum varieties!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldnBDZTBRRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"Pretty unique foods not frequently seen in SG. The pan fried bun signature of theirs is very good. However the other dishes are quite average tasting.

Service was very good, and food came quite quickly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldXR6ck53EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"Went before 12pm and was able to get a table.

The Shanghaiese pan-fried buns looks, taste amazing, although I think there is just too much dough.

Same for the xiaolong baos."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzY2OGZ3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"I am from Shanghai family and I feel I'm qualified to comment.
First, I was attracted by the menu as I can tell immediately many are Shanghai home kitchen type dishes that only serve in Shanghai street style small restaurants, like curry beef, sticky rice stick.
Here are the comments:
Service - robotic but no real customer attention.
Xiao long bao and Sheng jian bao - not good the meat is too hard, like a meat ball, and not juicy enough.  I don't agree with one review that it is too oily.  First the ""juice"" is not oil, it is pig skin boil long enough to become collagen so if anyone has tiny little common sense will know these bao is good for skin and beauty.  If you think it is oily then you better go eat burger.  Here the XLB skin is so thick and dry.  The SJB is not hot and bottom not crispy, just like toast.  The pork not only hard but with no pork taste.  Very disappointed, and if a restaurant will have signature dish disappointed, I can write off this restaurant.
Curry beef rice vermicelli - surprisingly good and authentic and it gives one star in my overall three stars ranking.
Last, as from photo, I am also very disappointed they put the vinegar on the Xiao long bao, do they respect the food or have any sense of hygiene?
Definitely no need to come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydjVUSWV3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Was excited to see Shanghai pan fried buns! However we left that place disappointed.

Shanghai buns were oily and skin was too think and doughy.

Xiao loong baos had thick skin and oily inside probably due to the fatty meat used.

Tried the dry minced meat noodles and was doused in oil too.

Tried the sour soup wasn’t great and should be served piping hot which wasn’t.

Service was no frills but fast. And for the price we paid, 28 bucks is rather cheap. Guess you pay for what you get."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNE1mQkVBEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"Shanghai soup buns. Steamed to perfection with crispy base. Bite in for the hot and flavorful meat juice! Super recommend, come early to beat the long queue. 👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycUwyTTJnRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,Shang jian bun skin is too thick. Pork chop fried rice is deep fried with powder coated different frm usual and rice is tasteless. Barley is cheap and nice. Guo tie and XLB so so only.Wine chicken too salty. Price is reasonable and service is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMXQzQVFREAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,"Fried rice has no taste. Better go to wok hey.

Mince meat noodle is too salty. Hair will surely drop.

Pan fried bun.. overpriced, over hyped. Doesn't taste like much.

Didn't finish my food. And I'm not even particular about food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NFpQbGZ3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"Went on a rainy Friday night.

Food wise,

▶️ Hot and sour soup, served warm and wasn't spicy nor sour.
▶️ Xiao Long Bao was also served warm with barely any soup in it. I believe the photo would be about to justified my comment.
▶️ Sliced pork fried noodle was really salty.
▶️ Ice barley was super diluted.

✅️ Luckily service was ok💪"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPakx1UzJ3RRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"Really decent pan fried bun they did, juicy with not too burnt bottom, obviously can’t compare to Yang’s dumpling in Shanghai but one of a decent one in Singapore

Chicken is a 2/10, too plain taste of the sauce ( maybe expensive wine in Singapore ) and the texture of chicken  is really so so"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMk0yWVZBEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"Decent food at affordable prices in Novena!
Should expect huge lunch crowd, it’s a staple for the Novena office workers.

Must Try~ Spicy Pork Noodles (dry): the noodles texture is amazing, cooked to perfection. Sauce is flavourful, abit too savoury with a hint of spice. Pork is succulent and flavourful as well.
Pan Fried Buns: It’s like Xiao long bau combined with a fried bun. The bun contains flavourful soup with a crispy bottom."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDRuYmVnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"Authentic and affordable shanghainese street food in a chic, modern compact setting. Pan fried buns and the drunken chicken were the highlight of the meal. The food here does not align with local taste buds, and hence the poor reviews. So come in here with an open mind and you'll might begin to appreciate true shanghainese cooking style. Fast and efficient service, it has one of the most intuitive qr ordering system I've ever came across."

It’s interesting how the place is narrow with limited seats and casual fast food feels but there is a open view kitchen with the chefs in high hats (professional) 👨🏻‍🍳😂 they have other Chinese dishes like la mian and XLBs which I would definitely go back and try 😍🌟 can pass on their fried glutinous rice (literally a whole stick of rice 🍚😅)

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHU2NGdBRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"Very AUTHENTIC Shanghainese taste. The quality is good. The first on the pan fried bun... Oh gosh! The meat 'gravy' in the bun just ooze out. You cannot just eat it with chopsticks. You need a spoon while eating the bun. As for the 'gravy' that ooze out on the spoon, well. Drink them! It is not oily and it is clear. VVFM. (Very Valued For Money)

Will give four stars coz hope they will continue to maintain their standard and strive to better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyamNiSUVnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"Ordered the Sheng Jian Bao and soya bean drink for lunch. Loved the slightly doughy buns that were bursting with delicious meat juices. It was a lovely and refreshing lunch, especially when paired with the ice cold soya bean drink on a hot day.

Went back again for dinner with family. This time, ordered the Sheng Jian bao, Xiao long Bao, noodle soup with preserved vegetables and pork and noodles with pork in spicy sauce.
Family likes the buns- both the fried and steamed ones. However, the noodles were a disappointment.

Service was excellent and attentive. However the tables were placed too near to each other. Was not comfortable dining next to another customer who was sniffling away the entire meal and he was seated less than a metre away."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPemRYMThnRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"As a Shanghainese, I am very satisfied with their fried buns and xiao long bao, it is the taste of my hometown.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWJtUUV3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,3,"If I could I would give 2.5 stars.
Rounding up because this place is new and I understand they are finding their footing.

Visited on 8 June
Ordered Pan Fried Bun (4pc $5.80) and Xiao Long Bao (5pc $5.80)
It's nice that the listed price was the price I paid, no GST, no service charge. Not sure if this would change.

Pic: Unfortunately found a hair in the meat filling of the pan fried bun.
Pic: panfried buns as served + vinegar colour
Pic: discolouration on the white base piece of xiao long Bao tray

Vinegar provided was very diluted and ginger strips very very mild. I love my vinegar so if you don't you would not mind.

Pan Fried Bun - bottom is definitely nice-crispy, dough to meat ratio is not that bad. My issue was more how to consume it because I wanted to drip vinegar inside + eat as a whole to enjoy the different textures.
Butbthe filling was quite hot (mine were served fresh&hot, some reviews mentioned lukewarm food) and I didn't want the soup inside to spill out so it was a bit awkward trying to bite the bread part open and cool the inside down. After which it was still slightly too big to stuff the whole thing in my mouth.

I cannot speak for authenticity as I have not been to Shanghai to eat the panfried bun (nor to any part of China unfortunately).

Next, I will compare the xiao long Bao to the OTHER brand I visit (Din..).

BY COMPARISON, this one is cheaper, slightly bigger (I say so because I usually put the whole XLB in my mouth) but like a rougher made cousin, skin is not as thin and tender which speaks of lesser skill from the maker, meat is also less ""exquisite"". For instance, when I bite open Din's XLB, I never see the cooked blood on the filling (that jellyfish, smooth, patchy thing?).

ON ITS OWN, I'm happy to eat it. Would I go back? Not on my own, very unlikely. If my friends wanted to try it, I would go along and be happy/have no complaints, I would take the chance to try another dish probably. Perhaps it's time to research good pan fried bun in SG haha."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcThPQlZ3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,ordered the pan fried buns and xiao long baos. both dishes arrived very quickly upon ordering but the pan fried buns tasted better. the xiao long baos were quite average.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMHBIMFdnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,Veru doughy and thick skin for both xlb and jian bao. Feels like eating dough instead of the actualt dish. The vinegar condiments given was diluted with some other liquid which makes it not go well with the jian bao and xlb
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNGY2ZUZBEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,Go for the Shanghai 生煎包 which is bursting with juices. Other items such as the dry noodles are also worth trying.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a0x5VHp3RRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,Came in due to curiosity. Regretted it. I think the cooking style and taste is just not our style. Most are overcooked and average tasting. I totally did not like the pan fried glutinous rice. Too hard and sticks to the teeth.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNVlUWXlBRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"The pan-fried buns are really good! Better than the No Signboard chain.

The soup dumpling is lacking flavour though, especially when eaten with strong-flavoured noodles or other spicy dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdUl1MjdnRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"5 Stars if you order both types of 生煎包.
Four stars for all the other types of food except for noodles which I've yet to try.
It's authentic but the QC leaves some room for improvement.
Overall I still gave five stars because the price is very affordable!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcTl2UFlREAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Ordered Egg Fried Rice with Pork Chop and Prawn Pan Fried Buns. Pork chop definitely pre-cooked, froze and re-heated. So it is mushy and without the usual meat fibre texture. The egg fried rice has no wok-hey at all. The dish is bad. For the buns, the filling tastes ok but the skin is way too thick and doughy. I think they used the wrong type of flour or rather the flour mix is not good. Overall, food is bad and totally not worth the money."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycmNlTFpBEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"I do wonder if some of the 5 star reviews are friends and family of the owner.

Fried rice was bland, pork chop tasted like its re-fried and oily af. Their signature 生煎包，was weirdly sweet, as many previous reviews pointed out. Only good dish was the sweet and sour soup but even that was served luke warm, not hot.

Scallion noodles were okay, and the dumpling with chilli oil was bland as well.

Will not recommend. Although its cheap, the quality is really food court quality or worse."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN3ZiUEx3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Came across this store and thought to give it a try with my friend since it was new. Even though the images on the menu looked promising, we were disappointed because

1. Fried rice was so pathetic that I’d rather use the money to buy wok hey which is of much better quality. The fried rice tasted bland and the quality of prawns were BAD. Fried rice didn’t have spring onions but pathetic peas and carrots. There weren’t large chunks of eggs either.

2. Their wanton soup is of what you can easily get at the coffee shop for $3. The meat fillings were seriously pathetic and there were no seasonings. Soup had too much MSG.

3. Skin of the pan fried buns were too THICK

4. Sausage was supposed to be glazed, but it was very watery and the skin was 90% peeling off. There was no meat in the sausage and it looks dehydrated. My friend felt like she was having starch sausage.

Even though service was prompt, I wouldn’t  recommend this place because the food quality is THAT bad. I believe there are much better Shanghainese food places out there than this. At this point honestly just go to Ding Tele / DTF."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2RLTUZREAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,"Looks nice from the outside and the restaurant is full of people. We had high expectations when we went in, however we were rather disappointed with the food quality.

Xiao long Bao was not hot, just slightly warm.. seems like it has been pre cooked and left in the kitchen for quite sometime.. skin is thick and the pork just tastes weird."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHFfSjh3RRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"won't recommend. new place so thought to try this place. hugely disappointed with the food quality. we order the fried rice, and when it came, i asked my friend is it with cheese cause it's sticky when i tried to stir it. then i smell it and it stinks. rice already gone bad and the stench was so obvious.

signaled to this young lad which could be the boss, and he denied and said cannot be, and say their rice is ok WITHOUT even smelling it. he left the plate of rice on our table still, went to the kitchen to ask his guys, came back to take the rice, and then came back super apologetic and said the rice turn sour cause it's very hot inside. 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️ puzzled right???

anyway the food wasn't nice at all. the buns skin were super thick, the noodle drenched in oil.

hope the owners do something about it. the menu and photos looks promising but we left disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybE1hM1dnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Wife went into the shop and told me to meet her there. I read the reviews here and told her not to order so much but she missed my message and ordered the fried rice with fried pork chop, xiao long bao, pan fried buns, gyoza, drunken chicken and barley. I had super low expectations but when the whole restaurant was seated, I wondered if the existing Google reviews were harsh. The fried rice was tasteless and the pork chop though nicely fried, was strangely sweet. The pan fried buns/gyoza/xlb all too, tasted weirdly sweet while the drunken chicken. The only thing that was supposed to be sweet - the barley drink, was tasteless. I've eaten local cuisine in Shanghai before and the food doesn't taste this way. Might be a failed attempt to localise the flavours. Wouldn't recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOG82aTJRRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,4,"We ordered 4 dishes to share for 2 pax. Yangzhou Fried rice was a decent one, not as tasty as the famous DTF style but still acceptable.  I was very delighted when I see they have this Qi cai dumplings 荠菜馄饨红油抄手, but the taste is not what I expected, skin too thick. Both my colleague and me found it good was the drunken chicken (with strong shaoxing wine taste) and the duo fried dumplings (prawns and pork). Service was good, hope they maintain it. We spend $32.20 for this meal, without beverages."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3Q3aGh3RRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"The dumplings are just the right amount of thickness and the soup is good. Recommended to try this, especially if you have been to Shanghai before and are craving the authentic dumplings there"

Even their xiaolongbaos are really good. also love their side dishes especially the 大四喜. only thing that I didnt enjoy is their 酒酿圆子 dessert. Salted egg sesame balls dessert were also really good but quite oily.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdnVTX25BRRAB,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,2,"Went during lunch hour.

Ordered the xiao long bao and the spicy noodle.

Xiao long bao’s meat was thick like the normal meat bao. And the noodle’s soup is quite tasteless, the meat in the soup are just pork cubes.

The upsides are the food are prepared on the spot and came hot. And they are quite affordable.

However also to note during my visit, the staff asked me to leave to make way for a group of customers that just came in without enough seats. I havent finished my drink at that point. So that wasnt pleasant. They could have managed it better."

Overall, will not recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3FEblF3EAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"I think food here, it’s authentic enough by Shanghainese standards. The fried bun taste really as good as anywhere you can find in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyek5LS2FREAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,1,"Initially when I saw all the bad reviews about this place in Google and all the good reviews in Xiao Hong Shu, I thought this must be a case of non Chinese nationals disliking authentic Shanghainese flavours. So I decided to give it a try. I was wrong.

First there was the long wait, which is expected for a new restaurant offering Shanghainese food. We were a group of 3 and when it was our turn, we were seated at a table meant for two only. Just make do, we were told. If and when a table frees up, the waiter promised to shift us. Never did, even after more than one table frees up.

Food wise, we ordered the Sheng Jian Bao, Beef Guo Tie, Scallion oil Noodles, Chilli Oil Dumplings, Crab meat dumpling soup and Drunken Chicken. The dumplings, Sheng Jian Bao all tasted sweet without the umami of meat juice coming from steamed fresh meat. Someone in the kitchen took the idea of adding a little sugar, to elevate the taste of the dumpling filling, too far. The scallion oil noodles had too little scallion taste as the noodles was a disproportionately large serving. Only the beef potstickers and drunken chicken impressed, the former because it is a rarity and the latter because it tasted genuinely good. And I should know because I lived in Shanghai for almost 20 years.

Service was polite but inadequate. We were left sitting there to twiddle our thumbs for 10 mins without menu nor means to order using their QR code.

Not coming back anytime soon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM095VllnEAE,Shanghai Tan Pan Fried Bun,5,"Great food and service. We had great experience there.

Xiao long baos were juicy with super delicate skins thin, a little elastic and soft.

Regarding the Shen Jian Baos, from their skin to the filling everything about this dumpling is perfect.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dWVTLXZnRRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,3,"Ate halfway then realised forgot to take photo. Overall it was tasty and portions are quite generous but slightly expensive for a restaurant like that.

Fried rice - for 1 pax and 4.80 the portion was huge that it can feed two pax. However, i have had better tasty fried rice before

Cereal prawn - I think one of the best dish of the 4 dishes I ordered. Expensive but prawns were HUGE and fresh! I couldn't eat the tail part even though it was deep fried. They didn't really deep fry it properly. Not sure if it's like that but I appreciate if I can eat everything when it's deep fried. Cereal was sweet and tasty

Yam ring - I liked it as well!

Scallop and broccoli - disappointing scallops. Tasted rubbery and a lot of ginger. Broccoli was ok.

It's nice and probably I will come back for prawns if I crave. Didn't manage to try the crabs, will see how"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eTlPWDRnRRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,3,Opens till 11pm. A viable substitute for the Whampoa food centre if it’s closed for cleaning or for the day. Beef hor fun had some wok hei. But spinach isn’t a good substitute for Cai Xin. Wrong texture.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZb3ZtYjh3RRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,1,"I hardly give 1 star reviews but this place deserves zero — if there was such a rating.

Mediocre food with poor service and presentation. We ordered fish head noodle soup, hotplate beancurd, ngoh hiang, gong bao frog and curry fish head. The fish head noodle soup was tasteless unlike what was shown on the menu. The hotplate beancurd had the worst presentation by far! The curry fish head and ngoh hiang weren't too bad.

Service was horrible because I brought my grandma, but I think they just weren't welcoming or lacked situational awareness that they couldn't bother opening the doors for me to wheel her in. The waiter was also engrossed in his mobile phone game instead of giving food recommendations, and just left us halfway to ""let us sort out our thoughts"".

With such lackadaisical attitudes and lackluster food, I won't recommend anyone to patronize this place even if you're staying at the nearby housing blocks."

Maybe because family so waiter & waitress who looks like bro & sis are super grumpy and rude. You step into the restaurant and no basic manners to greet customer. Nevermind. Tell them number of pax and get rude reply. Maybe they are not short of biz. Prices are not cheap for a hdb restaurant. Would not recommend.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcmJHS29RRRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,1,"Recommended me to try their crab and said that it is fresh. When the crab is served, the pincer was so watery with little meat like an empty shell. When complaint to lady boss, she just look at it and walk away. The rest of the food there are just normal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MU15WmdnRRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,1,one star purely cause prices are on the lower side. else probably 0 stars to be given. food was BAD. tried twice and both was equally bad. food generally tasteless. no idea why people are queuing for this was the food is terrible. food from the veg rice shop is way better and cheaper.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NzZiWlZBEAE,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,1,Look at the chunks of white rice. You call this fried rice? Speechless. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4azVtMWlnRRAB,Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant,4,"Pin Hsiang Family Restaurant is an air-conditioned place where my family often goes to for affordable and tasty meals.

The prawn rolls are crispy and goes well with the sweet dark sauce. The texture of the omelette is nice and it's one of my favourite dish. Fish is served with mushroom but the taste is slightly on the bland side. Broccoli with scallops are ok. They served homemade barley. The rice portion is on the high side for me to finish one plate. You can consider sharing the rice if you are not a big eater.

Service of staff is merely taking orders and serving which could be improved simply by giving a smile to customers.

I like the way they cut out the meat and serve it. It's so different from other restaurants as I can eat the best part of the duck meat. The service crew are friendly, especially Daphne. She is very good, cheerful, proactive and experienced. She explains my questions in detail, and I like the photos that she took for us. The shots and angles are so nice. Dong Dong is very helpful too. All my requests are well attended to. I would like to compliment their service. The only thing to take note of is that they serve the dishes super fast, so you must not order all at once, as the table is unable to accommodate all the dishes at once. This makes us a bit too rushed to finish the dishes instead of slowly tasting the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbU5DZjRBRRAB,TungLok Peking Duck Novena,5,Good food and friendly service. The peking duck was excellent and delicious.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDZlN0Z3EAE,TungLok Peking Duck Novena,3,"2 consecutive days at this TungLok for dinner. The food is good but the service is horrible.
1. Slow
2. Only 3 staff are running the whole restaurant with a manager, Zhang refused to do anything!

Believe it or not, we as customer have got to clear our own plates and piles of Bones stacking on our plates and when asked that manager Zhang (a lady) and she just refused to lift a finger!

Pity the 3 staff were running around the whole restaurant to set up table, to take order, to serve and clear table while the manager was standing like a vase!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOFA2WEdREAE,TungLok Peking Duck Novena,5,"chun rong was very cheerful and helpful, service was very good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcWF6OEl3EAE,TungLok Peking Duck Novena,1,"Only saving grace was the service provided by our server (despite the lack of staff), and the average food quality.

Other than that, horrible experience & will never go back again. Food took so long to be served for the set menu for 8 pax. Ordered a separate portion of fried rice without seafood due to severe seafood allergy at the second course & we did mention it to our server. But it took 1.5 hours to be served! What's worse?! It came with crab meat in the dish! Luckily the diner noticed it or she would have ended up in the hospital already!

Before that when I went to check if the fried rice was ready due to the ridiculously long wait, I saw 2-3 servers picking out seafood from a plate of fried rice (I thought it wasn't for my table hence didn't say anything). Hello, do you guys know what is severe seafood allergy & how serious it can be how?! How can you just freaking pick out from the plate of rice & serve it, misleading customers to think that it is cooked seafood free. But thankfully because you guys just picked out the crabmeat like that, the diner still managed to spot leftover huge chunks of crabmeat before she took more than one bite or all of us would have ended up opposite at TTSH worrying for her life already!

Poor diner only had dessert to eat for the entire 2.5 hours. Thanks for the ""wonderful"" experience that we would never have imagined to receive from such a well established & famous restaurant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydWJDeFd3EAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"A no non-sense Chinese style “street” food with a little restaurant flare.  The “San Lao” Hor Fun is a must try (stir-fried flat rice noodles with fish & bean sprouts gravy sauce).  Expect a little waiting time if there are a lot of people.  Pass your time waiting for food by watching the service ladies talking (or shouting?) to each other in Chinese.  Recommended for cheap, local eats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ1pUTHVRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,"I love the food here , cheap and good reasonable price and delicious . My favourite is Hor Fun 4.5 $ serving in a full plate , The aroma of rice noodles stir-fried is so nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPN2VDVmlBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"We are their old regular customers for 3-4 years. My family ( 7+2 ) always spend hundreds of dollars per meal.

They make an mistake and served wrong food but expect us to pay. Even raised voice at us “ you ate the food, you need to pay”. If that’s the case, the staff shouldn’t even put the food on our table right? We even did the right thing by informing you that u served wrong however some of us ate it as we didn’t know what our dad ordered

Didn’t even bother to give discount or apologise. Btw that horfun worth$18 lol and taste super bland. There’s isn’t wok hey taste either. Definitely will never come back and support them."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMkwzNWVBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Clearly the food here is pretty good, especially the fish soup bee Hoon. The other dishes such as Thai tofu is nice as well. Downside of the place is that the seating comfort is pretty poor. And staff service is just simply atrocious, rude and unwelcoming. And food serving just takes such a long time despite the place being quite empty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOXEzQWZBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,"Tried a plate of their 三捞河粉. Plenty of fish slices, hor fun had nice wor hei and flavor was just right. Probably one of the best I had tried. Will return to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNk9tRXV3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"We have eaten here many times over the years. They have good days and bad days.

Tonight's food was excellent, but possibly because dining in was disallowed, so the chef has time to cook slowly.

The Prawn Paste Chicken were very crispy, and juicy on the inside. The oil used weren't stale.

The Beef Dried Hor Fun was also done nicely with wok hei, yet not too oily."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb05mNndBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Reached at 11.30am when there's only 2 small table of people. Waited 45 mins and 6 fish soups served at 12.25pm. staffs simply ignore queries when we followed up with the order. Demand mandatory tracetogether check-in, which we did as required. Demand social distancing for family of 8. We have to rush to attend event at 1pm hence we left at 12.35pm with two pending San Lou hor fun that is not ready (even dabao not ready). Lol. Overall fish soup is yummy and good experience as mentioned above. Also seen two tables of customers left angrily as they were ignored by staff for 10mins... Try it once at Least. We just sat patiently and waited the whole time, followed up every 15 mins. They will also ask patrons to change seat or tables as they wish. Just be prepared to wait and get your table chairs shifted once awhile. We are regulars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVLThEVGNBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"Second visit here and still tastes good!

The chicken wing is yummy and the curry fish was great too!

Parking may be a bit challenging."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaEk3OTlBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,"Tried their famous Fried Fish Beehoon with XO sauce, it was really very delicious. The fish slices were fresh and thick. The fish broth coupled with the milk, was very flavorful and of course with the addition taste of XO, it enhanced it totally, making the fish soup so fabulous. Definitely worth coming down here for their Fish Beehoon with XO sauce."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX2I3dUtnEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Bad experience today around 11.30am, ordered 2 bowl of fish soup noodles , waiting for almost After 40min wait , asked the waitress abt my order of two bowls of soup noodles She was rude to say that I need to wait longer. But  I saw they served those expensive dishes 1st to the customers that came later than us . My point is they need to inform customers about the long waiting time before they take orders. Don’t let customers wait for too long as they may have other appointments."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc0ppMzdRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Extremely rude waitress who thoght no end of herself! Placed order via foodpanda with pick up scheduled at 1246, 1 skinny sharp voice waitress in her 50s shouted at me that they didn't follow foodpanda timing, they had the choice to delay my order by 30mins! Don't understand why the restaurant paid such a staff to chase customers away!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NHVUYlVBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,Signature dish - big chunk fried fish meat XO beehoon. Love it to the max. Been frequenting their sister branch at Changi Road for years. Same old great taste. Best with cut chilli padi.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NHZQZnRBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,3,The hor fun was passable. The salted egg sotong did not look so authentic but turned out to be not bad. Wanted to try the crab beehoon and found it too expensive for 2 pax.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNEpMU1ZBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,My fav fish soup in Singapore. Big pieces of fish and the xo soup is delicious. My wife loves the prawn paste chicken. Here we ordered medium fish soup $12 and small prawn paste chicken $12
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM01lLUlnEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"This place has a great food with Low price ! The place is rather hot. We love the san lau mee, the shrimp paste chicken is so so this time round. The sotong kang kong is salty. Good for gathering. Seats are limited so go earlier if you can. Gather a few friends and go and share dishes. This time round we didn’t order prawn roll which I love!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdnBtWHFnRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,The food is alright but during lunch and dinner time you may expect to wait very long . If you intend to eat their pomfret steamboat you need to wait at least 30 to 45 min just for them to thaw the fish.Service so so don’t expect too much
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvM3VQT1lREAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"Yam Cake ($20) • First time having this dish. Not a fan of yam but I really enjoyed this dish. There were fresh prawns pea cashews and a lot of mushrooms.

San Lou Hor Fun ($12) • We revisited this place because the previous we were here everyone ordered this dish and it looked so good. But sadly, it wasn’t up to expectations..the one at Upper Thomson had a better texture and more gravy.

Honestly, there are definitely better zichar places to visit that offers better food and much better customer service experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOF9ERGFREAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Absolutely a MUST AVOID place if you desire some form of service. The wait time for take away was over 40 minutes with no pre warning when the order was taken. Order sequence preparation based on who comes first doesn’t exist when people who arrived and ordered after us received their food before us. The staff were either simply just standing around OR moved like snails to fulfill and pack food that were already prepared and left on the tables. What an experience compared to the many Hong Kong street restaurants I have patronized elsewhere. In addition, the staffs’ attitude were beyond rude. Go at your own RISK!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eTZiMDF3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,3,"Food is reasonably priced and good. My normal go to place for a meal. However, the services (staff) could be improved. Expect a less friendly, sometimes indifferent and rude demeanor. Otherwise, okay for a simple meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdFBtZHV3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,Best XO fish beehoon! The fish was thick and meaty and the soup is packed full of flavours! My ultimate comfort food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMTVyc3VBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,"Still like e San Lou Hor Fun, end up drive further to take away ...can try grab food too...enjoy then"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNTR2aDhnRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Go at your own risk. No matter peak hour or non-peak hour, the staffs don’t bother taking your order although they could clearly see you standing there at the counter. Super rude and arrogant staffs. Their fish bee hoon is also no longer as nice as before, fish was not fresh and food was served cold."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeU1qWnh3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,"i was strolling around the neighborhood and saw upon a food in this restaurant. After sitting down, i ordered the same thing with other guest. the food was ""Hor fun"", this shop a bit special with a lot of beansprout and fresh fish. I liked the fish, it was fresh and easy on the mouth. recommended to come again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMnB2Ty1BRRAB,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Bad experience. Suppose to be the pioneering  branch yet the service was terrible.The serving staff questioned me on the number of packets of red chilli that I need  when I ordered  3 packets of  food and requested me to take just one packet instead of 3 packets. Gosh, who was the customer in the first place? I had  been to other branches ie. Holland Drive, Bukit Merah, Jalan Sultan and Clementi (the best so far) and they did not disappoint me. As for the Balestier branch, kind of disappointed with their attitude, and it seemed like they did not improve as I read from other reviews sharing about the staff attitude. Hence they really need to buck up.The food and dishes though were good and consistent with the others branches."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJLVozc2RBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,My favorite zi char outlet which is available in holland village and balestier. Serves Great food great price.must try the egg yolk fish skin and prawn paste chicken. Normally I will order a fish soup with milk base which boast of thick slices of fish. Many similar outlets are stingy with their fish but this chain really puts in generous portions
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHBHZlp3EAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,1,"Horrible service! The rude waitress made us wait on a dirty table for 15 mins. When we walked to the counter to ask politely if we could order, they told us to go back to our seats and wait. Very poor service! This is despite the fact that there were not many diners.
Will never return again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTY3cE53EAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,Love the yummy fish soup with milk and wine! All - time favourite! Only setback is the parking nearby are limited

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc01XNkJREAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,4,Best fish soup in town. Fish is big and the soup base is tasty .

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbG9fRERnEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,2,"My to-go place for Fish Head Soup Beehoon. Always comforting and portion is big. One of the better versions of this dish in SG.

But even with the quality food, it doesn’t compensate for the poor service and attitude from the staff.

I am not one of those that demand 5-star treatment at a Zi-Char stall but the service there is honestly lack-of or non-existent. I had to stand at the cashier counter, in full view of the servers, for a few minutes to get my check. And that was after I hollered to an auntie to get my bill. And apparently that auntie’s priority was to get a fish head served first and continue to hang me. The others saw and nobody acknowledged me. Nobody. Ultimately I had waited long enough to almost leave since nobody really bothered to take my money anyways. Even as someone attended to me, there was no apology or thank you. Simple gestures and none was expressed. Maybe I will do better with GrabFood or Food Panda in the future."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNU5EaFpBEAE,Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee 881 (XO) Fish Head Beehoon,5,"Probably one of the best fish bee hoon soup in Singapore, richer tasting soup and they give you a generous amount of fried fish"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb2ZPWWdBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,The assam fish head has the right amount of spicy heat but could be a little more salty for my personal taste preference. The sweet and sour pork is nice and I liked the broccoli. The rest if the food is good but not spectacular. Serving size is generous.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlME1lWjVRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"A Standard Tzechar Restaurant with air condition. As expected the items are more pricey. $18 for cereal prawn, the prawns are not very fresh but still taste good thanks to the cereal. The prawn is big but there is only 5 pieces !

Service was prompt overall the taste is above avg."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLXNyMkdREAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"Good service n delicious tze char, signature San lao hor fun lives up to it's name. Minus 1 star because chicken essence frog legs was very tough and rubbery probably because it's frozen"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLU15eWNnEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"Consistently good. One can always count on them for a delicious meal! Black bean beef hor fun, prawn paste chicken, fish slice soup and cereal squid are the best!"

This one is full with singaporean and famous within local community.
No tourist at all.
Service is quite good. (Dont expect expensive restaurant type service here)

Ordered
1) Prawn Paste Fried Chicken (really goodddd)
2) MaPo Tofu (love it!!! Tofu also quite a lot and the taste is just perfectly balance. Not really spicy)
3) HongKong style steam fish (this one really good with very cheap price! Recommended!!!)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtam9YQVVBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"A chain tze char outlet which you can find across the island. Though not all outlets serve good food. Affordable tze char fare along novena. Nothing to shout about but its definitely above average. The restaurant was considerably filled on a Sunday night at 8ish when other restaurants were closing for the day.

If you're in the vicinity and looking for some tze char, I'd recommend this restaurant."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtamJYYVFBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,I enjoy my black bean sauce hor fun and prawn sauce chicken alot. The coffee pork ribs was not to my liking as it was too bitter. The price was reasonable and definately will return
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeUlPM0Z3EAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,3,"The restaurant was packed, probably the reason why 1 of the staff was disgruntled.. she slammed our drinks on the table & was a little rude.
The dishes were delicious."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdXYzRTlBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"My first time eating here and the San Lou hor Fun was superb! Portion was huge for $7, value for money!! The home-made barley drink wasn’t too sweet, just right! Will definitely come back again!! Highly recommended!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaXBuVzdnRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Actually I ordered more dishes but I forgot to take pics haha because it's a restaurant that my family has visited for years and years. So sad that the construction has affected its business; covid19 has also ruined it further. Hope more people visit and give them some business. It's a comfortable family restaurant and the food has its standard. Go eat go eat!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODgyZ0JBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Probably the best prawn paste chicken and fish beehoon soup in sg. All time favourite.

Seafood mee sua is actually hong kong yellow noodle
Gu lor york is hard

Overall the food are overated but the price is affordable for all the dishes we ordered
Waiting time is long after they serve the precook xia jiang chicken wings.
Uncle roger will love the MSG as after eating feel so thirsty"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTd1ppN2VBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,I have been here a few times and each time the food quality never disappoint. Simple yet tasty food. Will come back again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlblBfcDFRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,Stir fried Vegetables was tasty but the steam fish was cultivated grouper. Lemon juice was too sweet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTRTQlJ3EAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,1,Staff attitude very bad. Slice fish noodle soup more noodle then soup. Request for more soup even thought we are willing to pay staff gives lots of excuses and attitude. Last time patronising.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURneUt1OTJnRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"Food portion was kinda big for us. My parents, hubby and I sharing 2 noodles (hor fun & meesua), 2 veg, and 1 fish soup for dinner.. very filling. Prices are reasonable. Food taste good! Staff are friendly. Little walking from Novena Square. Will be closed for renovation 10-21 Sep 2018."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLTg2VXlnRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,Consistently good through the years! The prawn paste chicken stood out the most for me. It was well seasoned with a light and crispy batter.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZc3RieXh3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"Food was tasty. We had kungpow chicken, chicken was tender and flavors were good. The claypot meesua didnt really taste like meesua. It was more like ee mian, so it was a little out of our expectations. Also ordered some stir fry veg with garlic. The wok hei wasnt strong enough so it was just average. Service was a little slow but bearable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlOEpIUkRBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,One of the best family Chinese food restaurants I visited in Singapore the decor is simple but the food is excellent in service was great
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrblpDTGhRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"Awesome HK style restaurant! Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Service is decent and not overly tight like most restaurants.

Food is very good. Not overly heavy on seasoning as most places and has a very clean taste to let the ingredients speak. Think home cooking with no msg or added salt/sugar...

Har Cheong Gai was perfect! But skip the chili sauce that came with it doesn’t enhance the dish.

Coffee pork ribs was amazing! Fall of the bone while good crisp outside.

Choy poh home made tofu was yums! The nicely crispy choy poh bits gave great saltiness enhance you rice or noodles to go with the meal.

Samba sweet potato leaves great balance of sambal flavor but not overpowering.

Sam lo hor fun was very “clean” and not overly season. Subtly dish to let the fish and wok hei of noodles shine.

Highly recommended and definitely back again soon!

@iambruisedlee"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMHR5TzB3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,2,"Highly overrated. If this was a restaurant in Hong Kong I doubt they would have any visitors.

Not bad bad, just very average. Best dish we had was the baby Kai Lan, which was well-prepared and tasty. The rest was a bland mix of averageness.

I’m still sitting at the table and I’m already super thirsty. “May the MSG be with you”, as they say in Star Wars."

Better than average family restaurant. This restaurant has been around for more than 20 years. It is famous for their San Lau Hor fan. Assam Fish Head is good. This restaurant is worth trying."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0NzdHV0JBEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,Family comfort food! Good quality and reasonable priced.. famous for their fish slice noodle and kway teow dishes besides hei ko chicken wings etc.. had the curry fishhead which was fresh and meaty.. enjoy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneTdIQW9BRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Always my fav place for crab bee hoon and sliced fish soup. Love this cosy HK restaurant. Expect crowd during lunch and dinner. Do make reservation if you are going in group
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNEtUdjlRRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,Cai poh tofu so good. Salted fish fried rice was yummy too. They are generous with the salted fish. So flavourful
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MnN5ekpnEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Always nice food! Today's best food is the salted egg crab!!😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRX3BfSHJBRRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"Hearty tzi-char fare. Dishes came in decent sized portions, flavourful but not overly salty...packed with wokhei. Found that their popular 'sam lo hor fun' was just average, a little too dry for my liking. Otherwise prices are reasonable (but on the higher end of the scale) and have a good selection of items. Was there around 7.30pm on a tues and place was quite filled. Food was served after about 20min wait."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybTZEcU9nEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"Black Bean Sauce Beef Hor Fun $8.
Hor fun so smooth and soft. Beef is tender. Sauce is tasty.  V wok hey type!  Absolutely tasty!

I tried their Sum Lor Hor Fun ($8) before. Also v v good!  Hor fun is always so smooth and soft. V tasty and wok hey taste dish!

So far, I always walked out of this restaurant totally satisfied!

Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM3NqSXV3RRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,The 3-stars dishes on the menu are indeed tasty. But the prices are steep for tze char considering the portion size.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaHZIdGFREAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,3,"Zichar food that is reasonably priced. The cereal prawn and seafood noodles was good. Forget the coffee pork rib, the meat was tough and too chewy. Service is non-existent. Once they take yr order, it's hard to get their attention for service. The ambience is very casual."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycF9YSS13RRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,1,"Inform staff to check with kitchen several times but did not bother to get back to us. Saw the opposite table who came in way later than us already got their food and we are still waiting. In summary, bad and slow service. Not recommended to go during peak lunch hours if you cannot wait at least 45mins for your food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNnVDVVFnEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"I ordered prawn paste chicken, sliced fish hor fun, cereal prawns, ngoh hiang and spinach with 3 eggs which came to a reasonable $65. All were S except for the hor fun which was L. I've eaten here a few times and the quality was as good as ever. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the ambience which is pretty basic and the noise level could be high during peak meal times."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dnVYb1JREAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Nice hor fun. Love it. Really crowded tonight. Incredibly popular. Simply because they serve really good dishes. Really good.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcW82c0pREAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,Food is well prepared. It's basically good Zhi char in a simple sit-down setting.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeU5xYllnEAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"San lou hor fun was really good, but the slice fish bee hoon only had a lot of fish slices going for it."

Years after, I managed to visit once more and I’m impressed that the quality is still there! The sum lor hor fun is a must for it has impeccable ‘wok hei’. I also thoroughly enjoy their fish soup bee hoon with milk. Service was also very attentive."

The food is very delicious, falvorful without being too oily or salty like most..you feel good after eating. Service is nice, and you get to sit comfortably in AC. It's not the cheapest one out there (maybe $1 more than your usualy zi char) but for the quality... I'd gladly pay the price. will come back again very soon. I highly recommend the prawn paste chicken!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRa05IN253RRAB,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,3,"Famous for their fish bee hoon, however felt I hv tasted better. Generous portion of veggies and soup, but not the bee hoon and slice fish. For big eater, you may have to order two “L” portions as they only offer “S” and “L”. The rest of their stir fries are generally tasty and reasonable, which pretty much can get it anywhere in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0d2REX2Z3EAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,5,"One of our family’s favourite seafood restaurant in Singapore. We cannot go there and not order the salted fish fried rice and kang king sambal...Food is very good and affordable, service is mediocre but kind of expected for how busy this place tends to be. Prefer lunch crowd, a little quicker service. But food is always great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVMGNMT0xREAE,Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4,"Food quality is consistently good. Home style cooking and festive food, all available. Good for daily meals and family celebrations.

Parking at the IRAS building next door is plentiful. I have changed to parking in their basement due to all the roadworks. Drive slowly and Look carefully for Novena Gardens entrance to car park. Easy to miss."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbHB1X19nRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,3,"Environment is typical Chinese settings with modern twist. Area is quite limited so do make reservation. Food wise can be quite salty and oily but taste is good. Each dish is nicely presented. If one thing they can improve is probably their customer service which I find lacking in terms of friendliness and attentiveness. Otherwise it’s a good place to visit, especially impressive place to go for meat-eaters."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeU0zc3NBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"This is the 2nd vegetarian restaurant I would recommend. The food are really very nice and tasty. As it is pretty popular, make sure you make reservation ahead. And do note that they only allow you to stay for 1.5 hrs which is actually more than sufficient to allow others to have a chance to taste the food as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcHZDbTh3RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"It is our 2nd time to dine here. Tried new dishes and we like the spinach broth and yam dessert. The mala fish is a disappointment, it was served cool, not hot at all. Overall, food taste is good. Due to the crowd, staff are not as attentive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeWNfS1VREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Glad to have found this Vegetarian Restaurant that is just 2 mrt stops from my place. Generally the food is quite nice and the minimalist decor of the restaurant makes U feel relaxed. Will visit again to try more dishes.

Service was good, staff was able to give suggestions and took care to make sure you are comfortable. Quality of food is there. The soup is nice. The sambal cod fish a little overdone to my taste. Do not have any fav dish although they all all good. The best for my companion is the dry laska."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaTVMWld3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Nice vegetarian food. Not exactly healthy but definitely tasted good when dining in compared to our previous delivery order.

But I think they are quite understaffed. Quite hard to get the staff’s attention.

Good location - will be back"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldGVhWC1nRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Unique fusion allium-free vegetarian dimsum! Would recommend the Truffle Mixed Mushroom Dumplings. Unfortunately the information I got via social media direct message, via the staff in-person, and via the online Oddle menu all differ greatly in terms of which items are vegan... Best to verify with the staff when ordering if you don't consume egg and dairy. Hope this can be better clarified. Conveniently located near Novena MRT Station Exit B."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaW9xaW53RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,It's a new atmosphere. Better when it was in Quality hotel. New a la carte menu. The chilli crab bun was super delicious! It's made from oyster mushroom not mock meat. It has dim sum options too. Give it a try.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOHZXQ1pBEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Came here on a weekday afternoon for lunch upon a friend's recommendation. We arrived at about 12nn to find the restaurant packed with customers! Thankfully we had made reservations. A nice comfortable setting where you can have a relaxing lunch with friends and/or family. Staff are not quite so attentive though and they seem to be short-handed. Food took a while to arrive, maybe also because of the crowd.
For 3 pax, we ordered a Grilled Fish in Sichuan Mala broth, a serving of mixed vegetables and a serving of Mala Crystal Bao. Portions were just right for us. I did not quite fancy the Mala broth - it was not spicy enough. Though the friends liked it, where one commented that the ""fish"" was done almost like a real fish. Hmm.. I am not a fan of plant-based meat.
While we had 2 dishes that claimed to be Mala, I did not think there was sufficient spice at all to be classified as... Mala??
Nevertheless, the environment was nice and made for a good choice to have a catch-up meal with friends.
Conveniently located on L2 of Royal Square @Novena."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbnI3RGhBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"One of the better vegetarian food here in SG with very reasonable price.
Must try are the Buttered Abalone Mushroom & Caramelised Yam Dices. Cannot stop once started."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycks2TDNnRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,2,Not recommended. Tried their parents' day set menu. Food was soso and portion was small. Overpriced ($230 for attached w 4 teas). Service was not very good considering that it's a restaurant. Elemen is so much better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM3JfRWdnRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Ordered the following
1. Tofu homemade spicy XO sauce
2. Laksa
3. Truffle Fried rice
4. Kang Kong

All dishes were very cooked. There was an explosion of flavour when the Tofu entered my mouth. Laksa soup was smooth, light, super tasty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybnZUVHNnRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Amazed by the unique dim sum. I ordered the afternoon tea and some dim sums. Loved the signature mee sua squares and truffle mixed mushroom dumplings♥️
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybnA2NFBREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Such a shame that I just found out this restaurant recently. The food was so good that you cannot tell there’s no meat at all. Mala grilled fish is the must and dim sum at lunch must try also!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtblBUT1B3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Great Chinese vegetarian restaurant, fast table service & awesome variety of dishes on the menu. The dry laksa is highly recommended. Will come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGZTa1FnEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Tried black pepper lion mane and stir fry brocoli. Interesting texture for the lion mane, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, different from the usual way of cooking lion mane. The black pepper sauce is not that prominent, can't really taste the pepper. Brocoli is fresh with some fried ginger slice and the sauce is not that salty. Service can be improved especially the staff manning the cashier counter."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd3ZPOTdRRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"They have a 2pax promo now where you get to choose 6 dishes + 2 bowls of rice + dessert. All for $39.90 before GST & tax. SUPER VALUE FOR MONEY.

Although, for a vegetarian restaurant, their one vegetable dish that we had (long bean) was not good. The long beans were quite old and too hard and fibrous when you bite into it. Please order another Vege to try!

Found their service to be prompt and good, probably improved since there were a few complaints about this from the reviews months ago.

Must order:
Butter Abalone Mushroom
Crispy soy nuggets
Truffle Hakka Abacus Seeds

Don't order:
Long bean with chai po"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX0tPOURnEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,A very delicate type of vegetarian dishes that we tried in the restaurant. Refreshing menu and rather interesting. Well recommended for authentic vegetarian foods
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbGIyaDV3RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,2,"They have put in effort in making their menu interesting with fun description and nice photos for their dishes that appeals to the palate.

The interor decoration of the restaurant is acceptable.

We are not impressed with the 2 dishes we have ordered. The butter abalone mushroom is nicely fried and crispy, however its too sweet and we do not like it marinated with curry. The ma po to fu is Sichuan Style with a very strong mala taste. We had mo po to fu from other restaurants which is more fragrant and less spicy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxci1DcGdRRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Amazing and thoughtful customer service! Restaurant listened to the feedback given when being emailed (responded within the same day too) and the food was spectacular (both for takeaway and dining in)! Not a disappointment, even when my meat-oriented friends are being dragged along. The yam cube dessert and deep fried mushroom were the highlight of the meal!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z3ViR0lBEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,Not a big fan of veg food but this place surprised me.  The star dishes were the abacus and cod fish. Looks and taste great!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPODRHUXVRRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Really pleasant experience. The food are really tasty and unique. Something special for the taste buds
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHBERmJREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,Nice ambience with good variety of food. The  vegetarian carrot cake is good. Tried their Tom yum fried kway tiao and fried Laska.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUlxX3lBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,Presentation & taste of the food is good. However the staffs seems to be under and were struggling with the dinner crowd.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXamZtWi13RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Grilled ""Fish"" with Sichuan Mala Broth

First attracted by the photo and now charmed by the taste!!!
Very ""FISH"" !!!
Goes so well with the Mala Broth
Spiciness is just right,  watch out for the hemp pepper!!! It will numb your tongue and lips!!! 😫

Luckily the Ice Blended Soursop calm down the numbness  😅"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3RPeElREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Tried Blue Pea Flower Nasi Lemak @ Lotus Vegatarian. This is one of the best vegetarian nasi lemak you can find. The sambal is nice and not too spicy. Furthermore the sambal was put inside a small plate which I always hope other restaurant can follow this method because this cam prevent the oil from sambal flood into the rice. Thumbs up for the food presentation.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMkxyY2VREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,It was a vegetarian restaurant. We ordered grilled spicy fish and the taste was okay but to me abit spicy. It will be very good for someone who prefer vegetarian foods as the quality no doubt is very good. I am more of a meat eater 😊
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaThtNHZRRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Love their current 重庆烤鱼 item! There's a tomato based version for those who can't take the spice, or remember to ask them to 加辣, if you like your dish a little more fiery!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN0lmMXpBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Good food, Good embience, but some stuff was not so friendly, cashier was so loud handling the customer on the phone. I think you need employee training."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNGNuWU5BEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Interesting place for plant based and vegetarian dishes. Very good range of rice, noodles, dishes and dim sum. Food is pretty decent - like the Hong Kong Ee Fu noodles and the rojak. Good range of soups as well. The set meal for 2 pax is also a good option that includes dim sum and a combination of other dishes and soup."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeGYtSTJ3RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Buttered Abalone Mushrooms, Mala Fish and Mapo Tofu are a must try.
Nasi Lemak is also top notch!

Great food, great service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMllPTFZ3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"2nd review dine in 13 aug.
Special call out to the fish in tomato broth , using bean sheets , served with toufu , tomato, mushrooms and white fungus , it’s really addictive .

fried shredded yam salad  was crispy and light .

1st review Ordered via food delivery dried laksa, diced mushroom
With toufu, fried banana fritter with red bean and steam bean curd roll.  The dried laksa was very good , flavour and aromatic ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdmRfZTdBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"I can’t believe that I have not put up a review of Lotus Vegetarian! We have been enjoying their food since 2020 when I took out from their Ubi kitchen. And of course proceeded to enjoy the lovely and bright ambience at their Novena restaurant when it opened.

Today, I stopped by to pick up some dinner. Decided to try something new, cos always eat the same reliable favourites - dry laksa, all the tim sum esp fupijuan (bean curd sheet roll), chasiewpow, jianpow, shuijing pow.

So we had dry laksa (haha couldn’t resist), French beans with radish, mapo doufu and cordecep soup. Everything is as delicious at home as when eaten on site. 10% discount for taking out too!

Update 10/7/21
Taking the chance to dine in before 5 people can eat together… it’s quiet tonite on sat nite with less than half the tables filled. But I’m sure business will pick up once HA is lifted, so gotta book or wait for seat.

Had the nasi lemak and mutton curry. Both were delicious. Nasi lemak was tasty without being overbearingly rich. Bleu pea rice was fluffy, chilli was sweet and spicy, fried fish pieces were fragrant, lightly blanched lady fingers were dressed in chicken rice chilli, and fried “chicken” pieces (bean strips) were crispy and tantalizing!  Again The mutton curry was tasty but light. There was a generous amount of potatoes and “mutton” pieces in the soupy but not diluted curry which we drank up!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNWVITWxBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Nice setup for a veg restaurant. Food is good and I like their variety  of soup .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MkxhX3NRRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Sumptuous vegetarian food. Had the chicken rice, nasi lemak and the buttered abalone mushroom. Chef puts a lot of effort in gettimg the taste right. Recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbzRUbWN3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Delicious Dim Sum and alot of others ala carte local dishes!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMk9fYmJBEAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,3,"Even though food looks good, taste wise it was okay okay. The food was pricey too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eF9mMjdBRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Very good vegetarian food. Fancy. I loved the tofu and the ""cod fish"" especially."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyME0zWmNREAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,2,"I'm a long-term vegetarian, and I like to taste the vegetarian restaurant Jiayao in the whole island. This restaurant is one of my favorite visits in the past, but this time I'm very disappointed with their snacks. Among the five snacks I ordered, four of them were filled with the same material, and even the taste and taste were the same! I've never been angry while eating like this time! Because their other dishes are not bad, I am willing to give them two stars! I hope they can see my comments!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaHJ5NndnRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"I really like the spacious feel of the restaurant.
Came during dinner time and the dim sum was all sold out. Other dishes we wanted to order was sold out.

Food here is generally alright, we liked everything except the trio platter. Just skip that as it was not very nice.

Dry laksa is nice and I like the wrap as it reminds me of peking duck and their dessert yam was served in a amazing view with dry ice and smoke pouring out"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM3VqRnBnRRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,Spacious and clean restaurant with friendly staff serving good quality vegetarian food. Quiet and cosy setting. Great for family and friends gathering.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2Z1pHZkR3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,4,"Dim sum is good, we like the dim sum, but some suggestion:
1) should have tea pot tea instead of tea in a cup, Chinese 飲茶 style.
2) please cheer up your waitress, they look in bad mood, when serve should say please enjoy and when we say thank you they should say you are welcome . Basic manners must apply! I wish you all the best. I guarantee your business will be much better if you can improve dinning services."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdl9XeXZ3RRAB,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"First time here. Ordered 4 of their signature dish. Was so impressed with the quantity, quality and price of the dish that I signed up their membership. Will come back for more and hope to share more detail"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydjRiS0V3EAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,"Food here are really yummy, I recommend the herbal soup, vegetarian creamy soup, and snack sugary yam （糖霜芋头）."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ak5TVU9REAE,Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant,5,A pretty awesome place that serves vegetarian food. They have a huge variety of dim sums and also set lunch at decent prices. We order an executive lunch set for 2 pax and order another dish. It was very filling and does not leave a oilly after taste. We will be back again for such to try the other dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeXVLOFlnEAE,Warung Kampung Novena,3,"Tried the fried fish with green chilli (ijo?) set.

The fish was well fried and tender. However, the portion was a little bit too small. Taste wise, it was a rather sensational experience!

Worth a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMHZHLUNREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,1,"My husband ordered Tom Yum Fried Rice from here for us and asked the lady multiple times to not add any seafood/fish aside from prawns into the rice. When he got home we found seafood in the dish, what a waste of food and money as we cannot eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeVBlMnZ3RRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,1,"You should really look into ur food portion. Food delivered was only less than half of the box.
And pricing was not comparable to the portion. I hope u can improve on that.
Also we ordered to break fast and obviously not enough for even 1 person share.
Rather for a kids portion.
Truly disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOGRucm5BRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,"Love the chicken rendang and perkedel, will definitely come back to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbjQyRXNnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Hidden gem at the basement of Square 2. Ordered the green chilli chicken set super yummy. They are Halal certified and serve Thai food as well!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVXzhfT1ZREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Love their beef rendang and BBQ chicken..Their homemade chilli is super duper yums. definitely highly recommended! Must try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheDhXbHJnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Beef Rendang is extremely tender! Pekedel is cripsy on the outside and fluffy inside.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbl91eWNREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,The food is yummy and authentic. They have healthier choice like brown rice. Good to know they don't use MSG
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcEltaFpREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,4,"Ever since the change of staff, the food portion become smaller :/ Price stayed the same but still tastes more or less the same"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwZ01pLXdRRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Super nice beef rendang... juicy and the spice  level is great
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteUtuNTBnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Your green chilli chicken damn sedap. I love patronising ur stall
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNDVUemVnEAE,Warung Kampung Novena,1,Served precooked BBQ Chicken which was hard and cold.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbl8yeUd3EAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,"good food and affordable, will definitely come back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHejRxeHhRRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,4,Good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMTlQQ2h3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Quesadilla felt empty unlike other outlets. Ingredients were unevenly spread too. The others were okay. Speed was fast tho, received my food in less than 10mins even though there were other customer(s) before me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMjV1UjVBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"I love Guzman Gomez's burrito bowl! Filling and tasty. Will try to request for more onions😍 in future as we used to be able to scoop the amount we want, but due to Covid they now prepack them (garnishes and sauces) in separate small containers. Love my burrito bowl with plenty of 🌰"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTh2cXlRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"food quality and ambience is similar to other branches.

tried mexican cola for the first time, the sweetness is so distinct, it’s not my favorite 🤗"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaE9iaE5nEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"For the price and quality of food, you’ll find nothing else that compares in Singapore. They even have Jarritos. The staff is also great and make for a very positive experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdnMtUmR3EAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,First time trying here. Good food. Love the burrito bowl and soft tacos.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcEthVjlRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"I dine here at least 3 times a week. I love the food. However, the staff aren't consistent with their serving. There are days the rice will be so much more and hardly any meat. Another time, their burrito can be pretty light."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbU12bkpREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"I just had this for lunch with my family and it was not bad. It’s basically classic Mexican food and it’s good, just that we don’t particularly enjoy eating Mexican food so it was okay. The fries was good, crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. Taco was excellent, and nachos were good. Just note this, if you are thinking of getting a Burrito regular sized, know that it has a ton of beans and rice inside; portion overall very big! Service is efficient."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMmJTZDZRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"My daughter vomited and suffered all night after eating the burrito bowl delivered in the evening. I couldn't complain because I was in a hurry to go to the hospital, but it is a very angry experience. I enjoyed it as a delivery food for a long time, but recently, the taste differs every time I order, so I tried not to eat it, but it became the last burrito bowl. Pay attention to the quality of your food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcEl2UVBnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"minis promo for burrito seems smaller than usual 🤔
limited seats for dining in
staff didn't know table numbers during serving
but at least there's table service 😆"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNkpMdzJBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Nice burrito bowl but wish there were more tomatoes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaExmVnNRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,Presentation can be better improved. The beef portion size (which requires top up) was even smaller than the chicken (which requires no top up).. the taste wise is okay but can do with much more meat as only vegetables can be seen in the tacos.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnM3ZDFRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"I think I was discriminated against here. I am a regular of Guzman y gomez outlet in Yishun North Point. I always received good service and food from there and expected same from here. I went in at around 11.50, much before lunch rush. There was only one other dine-in customer. Even after 25 mins I didn't receive my order, while customers who came in after me kept getting their orders. When I finally complained, they gave me my order without cutlery or tissue. Will not visit this outlet again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejktZmZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"Horrible experience from fhis outlet! Staff are disorganised, they actually forgot about my orders! Apparently I am not the only frustrated customer that's waiting incessantly long. You guys need to put in a system of checking order fulfillment to have a basic level of customer service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bDVpWEpREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"Very average food, it's slightly pricey. The burrito was very bland, the rice in it was bland. The only thing good on the entire menu is nacho fries"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z05PYXBnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"I placed my order via Deliveroo. I realized i had the wrong item order immediately after i pressed the sent button. I then immediately asked Deliveroo to help cancel my order via live chat. But the Deliveroo chat told me the order could not be canceled as the delivery was already on the way. How can the delivery be on the way 1-2 minutes after the order was sent in?

I tried to call the restaurant five times, but nobody answered the call. This will be the last time i order from this restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXJqOVZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"First time trying this mexican food chain and I must say Im pleasantly surprised! Ordered from foodpanda but the food was still fresh! Got the mild nachos with grilled chicken. For $16, the price was quite expensive but it was really filling which was unexpected!! The guac was delicious too :) Will definitely try their tacos and burritos next!!"

Timeliness: Excellent, never delayed
Taste: Excellent

Recommendation: Spicy Chicken Burrito Bowl with additional pico de gallo"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM3JyUVVnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Good place for an introduction to Mexican food. A little pricey but flavours are strong and good. Nachos and fries are great. Unfortunately they do not have salsa here so the strong acidity and spice is missing
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeU9TWXdRRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Best Mexican food in Singapore!

To be sure, there aren't many options for Mexican food on the island. Nevertheless, Guzman y Gomez food is generally high quality and eminently edible ... Though it may not compare to taco truck food in LA!

I stick to the spicy beef option for most dishes with the burrito or burrito bowl being my preferred choice. The quesadillas are also decent.

If in Singapore and craving Mexican food then GYG is your only choice. Thankfully, they have multiple outlets across the city to satisfy your craving."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeU5pNERBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,First time here. Nice place and crowded on a weekend lunch period. Ordered the Burrito chicken wrap and bowl chicken. Recommended to have with spice. Nice overall!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MmFTTndnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Staff were very professional and service was top notch even if it's a more fast food style place. Love the fries, especially the chipotle seasoning and soft chicken taco :)) I don't normally eat tomatoes but it's really delish as they take out the tomato seeds and its so nice together as a whole taco"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNlo3dWd3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,Used to quite like the food at GYG but the standard at this outlet has just fell off the cliff. Had the burrito bowl which had a pathetically small portion. Food was rather cold. Disappointing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxajlHakFREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Not much to say about it except it is just super tasty. Love their soft taco with grilled chicken or steak!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHAyOVJnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"On the GYG website it says the sauces are ""free at every GYG"". However, when asked, staff said its chargeable.

This outlet used to have great service but i think they got a new manager/supervisor somewhat recently and its just been downhill from there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycWItUUlnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Always good. Value, clean tasting lunches. Chicken burrito bowl ftw"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjM2ZHamJREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Can't go wrong with a good ol burrito bowl :-) Food's great, and thank you Kelvin and team for the warm welcome always!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NmQ2Vm5RRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"A little ""expensive"" for the portion you're getting. Food tastes okay. Quesadilla had very little cheese which was quite disappointing. The fries were fresh though (which I really liked). The Churros were quite good but nothing special about it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aVpiZV9BRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"The best compliment I can give this chain is that it's the Jamie Oliver of Mexican food. Proudly underwhelming, uninspired, overpriced yet somehow, you'll find one everywhere. While i can see how they might appeal to the undemanding and uninitiated, there is definitely much, much better Mexican food out there (and yes even in SG)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzeUpEMWVREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Tasty food. The salad was nicely done. The burritos was delicious too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cUtxaWNnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"First time trying with the wife as the reviews sounded promising. Ordered a spicy beef burrito set and a spicy pulled pork bowl set. Both were very disappointing... Very little meat in both, just lots of tasteless rice and beans... Miserable amount of salsa given. Food was barely even warm considering we were dining in... Chips were obviously stale. Not sure if they forgot to put the spice but both the orders were not spicy at all... ""Chipotle"" Fries, while cooked well, crunchy outside soft inside, tasted completely plain and devoid of any seasoning... Not sure if the outlet ran out of salt or what... The only thing that we both managed to finish was the lemon tea... Have tasted real Mexican food and this is not even close sorry. Went to McDonald's after..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN1pDc3l3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Hi there,

I love your food and there's no doubt on the quality. But recent my 2 delivery orders missed one item each. Last time set menu fries was not packed and today chipotle mayo was not packed. While understanding busy delivery orders, it is important to ensure customers to receive what they have ordered. Would appreciate more attention to pack better next time. Thanks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLM2R1WGJnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,3,"My takeaway order had been missed and I needed to wait for a long time until staff noticed. Then, they forgot to provide utensils for burrito bowls.Not sure if it is due to staff shortage, but unless you dont remind them, they dont seem to bother tracking the things in order. Food is not bad but service is lacking."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMEppc2tBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,"Food is fine. One staff was very rude and mocked my accent to other employees as I was ordering. I guess she thought I couldn’t hear her. If the owner of this restaurant sees this, pls get to the bottom of who this is (appeared to me a manager as she was holding paper, female, in her 20s?). Looks like some re-training and disciplinary action are needed. Very bad experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbXZQRnl3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Great food for the price. Hard to find food Mexican fast food in Singapore so this place never fails to satiate that craving
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMmVxSTRnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"It's a classic mexican fast food place, just that it's quite conveniently located right next to Novena MRT station. We had the burrito bowl, and the nachos fries, both of which were pretty good. It's the kind of food that I'll have for a quick lunch, but I'm not sure if I'll enjoy a proper sit down meal here necessarily."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeHV5SmhBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,2,"Food via delivery was always good, but somehow dining in turned out to be a horrible experience. Didn't take long for them to come up with our food but it came in cold for my friend and I with much lesser meat than usual.
Best to avoid dining in I guess."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybWZDV1BREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,Always manage to get the place to sit. However the pricing has stayed flat but the quantity has reduced.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Z0tfazhnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,First time eating here and I was not disappointed at all the food was delicious especially the burrito bowl. Staff was very friendly. The place was clean. It was an amazing place to dine in. I would recommend this place!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeHFhellBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"My first experience  trying mexican food was at vatos urban tacos & was utterly disgusted by them.  hence was a little decisive on coming here. Glad i came ,the quesadillas & food here are delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ2VDSmZREAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"Whenever I am homesick for some solid 'great quality' tex mex - I look no further than Sydney stalwart GyG.

The staff at the Novena branch are courteous, happy to take dumb questions, and exceedingly speedy with their order fulfilment.

Eating in, also a great experience (now that we can)

Overall, great outlet, great staff, five stars!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eHVhNnJnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,1,My to go order was missed and I ended up waiting for 20 mins. The person packing the food was right in front of me and didn't bother to enquire about my order number but instead avoided looking up at all. Only when I asked then they realized the miss but tried to avoid acknowledging it by saying they will start preparing it...which took 2 mins to be ready.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX2RlOFdBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Good, staff are helpful, would recommend, tho needs more seats"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMGN6SnN3RRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,A bit overpriced for the food... Fast and efficient for some Mexican themed food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbVA2ZVVBEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,"delicious food and great service from staff , definitely will come back again 👍🏻👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeVAtUm5BRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Food is good. Service is fast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNllubXhnRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,2,"I ordered 2 veggie burritos for takeaway today - 1 was alright but unfortunately the other was a soggy, deconstructed mess. The filling was falling out as I was unwrapping the burrito and the tortilla wrap was soggy, broken and very unpleasant to eat.

Rating 2 stars for inconsistency."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLemVIaHNBRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Sometimes I want to be induced into a food coma. When I need that, this is where I come. Pork burrito does the trick. Eat one and a nap is sure to follow. Puts me to sleep faster than my wife chatting in bed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ejhhcVd3EAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"Service was prompt. Food is as expected, delicious and fresh. Limited seating due to distancing requirements so go early to avoid crowds."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMWFyT0NnEAE,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,4,"This rating is rounded up from 3.5. The food is fresh and fast and the sauces to add to the dishes are delicious, but there was hardly any chicken in my burrito, it was mostly (plain) rice. Disappointing for Mexican, but OK if you have a craving in Singapore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWJYdG9BRRAB,Guzman y Gomez - Novena Square,5,Just had the burrito bowl with pulled pork for lunch. Really good and the pork was so tender! A tad on the salty side but the corn chips helped!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeXVLOFlnEAE,Warung Kampung Novena,3,"Tried the fried fish with green chilli (ijo?) set.

The fish was well fried and tender. However, the portion was a little bit too small. Taste wise, it was a rather sensational experience!

Worth a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMHZHLUNREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,1,"My husband ordered Tom Yum Fried Rice from here for us and asked the lady multiple times to not add any seafood/fish aside from prawns into the rice. When he got home we found seafood in the dish, what a waste of food and money as we cannot eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeVBlMnZ3RRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,1,"You should really look into ur food portion. Food delivered was only less than half of the box.
And pricing was not comparable to the portion. I hope u can improve on that.
Also we ordered to break fast and obviously not enough for even 1 person share.
Rather for a kids portion.
Truly disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOGRucm5BRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,"Love the chicken rendang and perkedel, will definitely come back to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbjQyRXNnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Hidden gem at the basement of Square 2. Ordered the green chilli chicken set super yummy. They are Halal certified and serve Thai food as well!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVXzhfT1ZREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Love their beef rendang and BBQ chicken..Their homemade chilli is super duper yums. definitely highly recommended! Must try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheDhXbHJnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Beef Rendang is extremely tender! Pekedel is cripsy on the outside and fluffy inside.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbl91eWNREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,The food is yummy and authentic. They have healthier choice like brown rice. Good to know they don't use MSG
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcEltaFpREAE,Warung Kampung Novena,4,"Ever since the change of staff, the food portion become smaller :/ Price stayed the same but still tastes more or less the same"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwZ01pLXdRRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Super nice beef rendang... juicy and the spice  level is great
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteUtuNTBnRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,5,Your green chilli chicken damn sedap. I love patronising ur stall
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNDVUemVnEAE,Warung Kampung Novena,1,Served precooked BBQ Chicken which was hard and cold.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbl8yeUd3EAE,Warung Kampung Novena,5,"good food and affordable, will definitely come back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHejRxeHhRRRAB,Warung Kampung Novena,4,Good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MjZqN3BnRRAB,Rusnah Cafe,4,Come here for a quintessential Malay breakfast! Mee Rebus and Lontong were available when we got here at 10am on a Thu. Lontong was good and decent and the Mee Rebus was definitely above-average. Worth a try! This place is hidden find indeed!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNEtyYTB3RRAB,Rusnah Cafe,5,"Great local Malay food. We came with our 3 kids, tried the Mee Rebus and the Gado Gado. Left very satisfied. And all for a very affordable price! Will come again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdU1xSDJ3RRAB,Rusnah Cafe,5,Excellent Gado-Gado and Mee Siam
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVM0xxZ3R3RRAB,Rusnah Cafe,5,Very good and affordable mee rebus.

Excellent Nasi padang! Hidden gem!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbC1leTh3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"Five stars for ambience and portion size!

The Malayan Council at Windstedt is all about the vibes, an atmosphere so nice you’ll definitely enjoy chilling there.

Food portion was HUGE, it was our first time there and we definitely ate our fill, have two mains along with drinks and a complimentary side!

Service was good, food tasted good and we even got complimentary cakes to bring home. Price point definitely worth a mention, this place is good for occasions as it’s on the high side. Definitely fitting for occasions! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMWFQVGZREAE,The Malayan Council,4,"There for a reunion visit of our secondary school premises. Service was not the most efficient as we were served a satay platter instead of a satay pizza as we had ordered. The ambience was relaxing and food was good. Although it wasn’t a busy night, staff did not really pay much attention to us. Would still come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDltdzVnRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,I love the classy and classic ambience it brings... Truly a place for a date with our love one. Abit pricey but for the quality and quantity given is worth every penny. They are so generous that they gave us a free side dish.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ3VuOVN3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,Very generous food portions and personable service. I enjoyed the smoked duck pasta a lot - rich strong flavours that dance in your mouth. And I had a nice big chocolate shake (not pictured) to wash it all down.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXek5DWkNREAE,The Malayan Council,4,"Had a great lunch with my husband and celebrated his birthday there. The environment was peaceful as there's a few people at that time. The foods were good and the portion was enough for 2 pax.  I wanted their baked oyster coriander but sadly, it was unavailable. They gave us complimentary chicken wings and cakes. It was sweet of the staffs and customers there to sing birthday song for my husband haha. The malay supervisor was friendly but the other staffs were a bit quiet. It would be a perfect 5 stars if they had ask if i finish my plates before giving the cake because i still had some food left."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLWNHb21RRRAB,The Malayan Council,4,"TMC was a surprise find for me and my wife. We were looking for a place to pass the time while waiting for our daughter to finish her dance class, and chanced upon this resto.

Food is really tasty. Coffee is really good. Staff is really friendly and customer-centric. Ambience is quiet and serene.

Bathrooms though were not too clean, so hoping that can be solved with periodic maintenance.

Will definitely revisit the place to try out their main dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaDRPbVR3EAE,The Malayan Council,3,"The food portion is huge for main course and good for sharing. Taste was ok but nothing wow us. It was full house when we visited and the service was a little underwhelming. The restaurant is obviously short of hands. The staffs are very strict to covid measures, which is certainly good for us. Overall experience was ok. But visit again? Maybe no."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtc01TY1ZREAE,The Malayan Council,5,Very lovely ambience for a relaxing dinner. friendly staffs whose services are really awesome. Food was marvellous in terms of taste as well as presentation. Food portion is big and value for money. I'd suggest to order bit by bit if you're not much of an eater. Definitely coming back again with my family
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnI3S3N3RRAB,The Malayan Council,4,"Beautiful ambience. Food is delicious, service staff was excellent - so professional. Waited pretty long for our food to arrive; my food arrived an hour later while one of our friend's food was delayed by almost 2 hours (I'm attributing it to Ramadhan confusion) but the service staff brought complimentary fried chicken and cakes for us to 'alas perut'. Will come back with the family post ramadhan :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbTRITVJREAE,The Malayan Council,5,"Went to this restaurant on Monday with my family for lunch.

We ordered 2 Smoked Duck Lemak Cili Padi Linguine, 1 Laksa Goreng Barramundi, Cereal Fish and Chips and Malayan Satay Supreme Pizza for mains.

We got complimentary Malayan Wings for starters and Ondeh-ondeh cake for dessert.

All the food was very good and tasty. Portions are big and filling.

We were served by Firdaus, the Manager and Alexa, who rendered us with good service and suggestions.

Will definitely come back again in future, God willing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLXBXSXlBRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"First time to the restaurant and we had a great time.
We had top notch service from Ash & Fir. They were friendly and efficient.
The food was delicious & big in portion. All were served within minutes.
Dessert was absolutely delicious.
We had complimentary chicken wings & cake. It was very generous of the restaurant.
Will definitely come back"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybHUtMlh3EAE,The Malayan Council,3,"No problem with parking, ambience is good, nice and quiet surroundings. We came during the fasting time and we were the only table for lunch. Main courses are big portion. Perhaps for the barramundi dish can improve on the presentation. The mushroom sauce is similar to the mushroom soup in taste and texture. Liked the ondeh cake as u can can bite the bits of gula melaka within. Pizza crust is biscuit like texture."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnFLcU1REAE,The Malayan Council,3,"Service is acceptable. Food portion is quite big, however its just average. Do try the soft shell & mudcrab fried rice. Skip the cereal fish and chip and truffle fries. I was told that there is always complimentary dessert, but I didn't get it as the staff claims that they are running short of it. However was given complimentary chicken wing. Price is slight high $$$. But good thing is the service charge is included in cost of the dishes."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXemZBNxAB,The Malayan Council,2,"Overall food is not very warm probably due to huge crowd.

Truffle French fries not very crispy, would be better if it’s double fried. No truffle taste.

Fish from Fish and chips does not look appealing, slightly pale if you look closely at the picture. Would prefer if it’s crispy type of batter.

Seafood Pizza tasted normal.

Crispy salmon is quite disappointing, small portion and tasted like those sweet and sour fish from Cai fan stall (not even tze char standard).

Malayan wings tasted normal. The restaurant even gave us one more serving as complimentary. Thank you!

Better tasting one would be Lemak Linguine. However would only recommend this for sharing otherwise is too lemak to finish it.

Lastly, we ordered one serving of cake and the restaurant kindly gave us another serving as complimentary. 👍🏻Thank you!

Nice place to dine in. However food can be better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMEtuNndBRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,Third time coming to this outlet. Good place for large gathering if book ahead. Mains portion is very large. In-house cakes and dessert is the best.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXanBhYk1BEAE,The Malayan Council,5,"Interesting fusion food. They are really generous in giving food freebies. Portion is huge and one main would be good for two pax, unless you’re really hungry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OHFLSkNBEAE,The Malayan Council,5,One of the best Halal restaurants in Singapore. Great food and service. Portion sizes are relatively big so good to share.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMlpPWTh3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"Im really fussy when comes to food..
And i came here to try for the first time.. i heard is nice.. 😏 i dont need to comment much but ill give more than 5 stars!! Absolutely wow! Truffle mushroom soup, im dying for that!!🥰

But wait, my husband waited for his food for an hr.
Yes their waiting time is damn slow. Not enough manpower to serve outdoor customers.

Get to know the chef missed out his order.. kinda sad but luckily my dish portion is quite big so i shared with him.. hope it wont repeat the same thing to others.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3JHaXZBRRAB,The Malayan Council,2,"They are severely understaffed. The staff tried their best, but couldnt do much. The wait time for food is horrendous. Cutlery is dirty - not just watermarks, lipstick stains on cup, leftover food on the spoon.

Food is good.

4 stars for food, 0 stars for service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdWMyOVFBEAE,The Malayan Council,5,"A pleasant evening with family...celebrating wife's birthday. The food was incredibly marvelicious & the dessert....Superbly delicious..
Thanks to the Supv Firdaus & his team on duty wif 5stars service...will definitely recommend my friends & staff to dine again...MasyaAllah."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdE51eUx3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,"We picked TMC @ Winstedt for our staff retreat lunch and had a wonderful time thanks to the team of Ady, Zin and special mention to Shazz and Alexis! The food and ambiance were good and some of us even ordered extra food to take home. We had to make some last minute changes to our seating arrangements and Alexis was very accommodating. She always had a friendly and welcoming smile and attitude and was full of energy throughout. Well done, Alexis and team! 😄😄😄"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleEpEVGtnRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,This TMC has a chill vibe. It has both indoor and outdoor dining space. Food is fantastic as its other outlets. They also are capable of housing events.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX0xUSmp3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"Have tried all TMC/TFC outlets. But Winstedt outlet, countless times…but first time review 😂.

23 Oct, 345pm

Food: Delicious CONSISTENTLY. Never disappoint me every time. Portion of food is alot, and they gave complimentary plate of wings.

Atmosphere: Nice ambience and cosy feeling. Great for couples dating or want some quiet meals together.

Customer service: As usual lead by 1 superb supervisor ADY together with JESTER and AMAN, they’re friendly and helpful as always. Although they are busy with wedding prep event which starts at 5pm, they still put the EFFORT to ask patrons if food was alright and if we need anything etcs 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼. Bottomline is, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Yes its a little bit pricey, BUT for the quality of food, food portion, service rendered etcs will justified the price. They do give vouchers too. If you are lucky, at times they will give away cakes, its sooooo delicious 🤤. Today i bought their durian pengat cake, A MUST TRY.

And since we’re here for my wife and mine belated birthday, TMC gave 2 complimentary cakes and ice cream scoops!! Isn’t that GENEROUS??

May TMC prosper and grow even more in years to come. 🤲🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2c0p5SnR3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"It is always our pleasure to dine at the Malayan Council.  It is our 1st time at the Winstedt outlet and were pleased with the outstanding service and food served.  A special shout out for Ms ""Misha Omar"" for her spontaneity.  Really had a great time dining at the restaurant.  We will surely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNEx6bzFRRRAB,The Malayan Council,4,Great Halal Wine on the special day with my hubby. Good Food and Good view and serenity.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtXy0tUFlnEAE,The Malayan Council,4,"Being a secondary school alumni of this location, our group of ex-classmates will always try out the establishment at this location (which has gone through several changes over the years). This time, the Malayan Council i hope can last longer as it was the most crowded as compared with previous few establishments.
They served what i think was malaysian/indonesian fusion food. I had the more classic tahu telor as was quite full that day and my mates had the warm avocado salad, sambal goreng pasta and seafood tanghoon. Overall, service was good and prompt, nice ambience too. Food though, i find it average at best, maybe caused we had high expectations to start with. Hope they continue to improve on their offering."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbXRTQUp3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,"I can never have enough to say about TMC.
Customer Service - TIPTOP. Fast and personal.
Food - Fusion and put together very well.
Ambience - The Windstedt Branch is by far my favourite. Very bright, cozy, family-friendly, and simply GORGEOUS.

The Beef Ribs Roti Kirai
Braised short beef ribs, glazed and homemade secret ingredient sauce serve with roti kirai
$39.00
never disappoints.

The cakes, where should I start.
The Ondeh-ondeh, the chocolate cake, all melts in your mouth.
Not too sweet, just nice.

The owner Hafiz, and the staffs are all very friendly.
And we even got a free slice of cake for birthdays and anniversaries.

The price is quite a setback but for the price you pay,
you will definitely get every cents' worth through the glorious food, ambience and service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2JPTnpRRRAB,The Malayan Council,3,"Came here to attend A wedding lunch, foods not bad but service is not so good maybe lack of staff, just A few serving almost 100 peoples."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLXB5TTd3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"First visit to Malayan Council for my birthday celebration and on top of the generous portion and quality food, the excellent service from the staff who served us is clearly why we'll visit again. Thank you for the lovely drawing and cake."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2azZ5Y3h3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"Such a beautiful place to dine in, with the playlist being on point all the time. Everything we had was so good, left the place with a happy tummy. Received a wonderful service from Mr Ash from the Windsledt outlet. We had a few food on the house and left the place with more freebies. Talk about a company that believes in the more you give, the more you'll receive. Wont hesitate to come back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcmJ6MEZnEAE,The Malayan Council,5,"Super awesome dine in experience from the moment I step in until I leave the place.

Food plating is instagramable. Food is delicious and very tasty.

A cosy place for catch up with love ones."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1emJETENBEAE,The Malayan Council,5,"My children love this place. Service staff are warm and friendly. The food is good and portions are generous. I enjoyed the duck and lychee salad.

So far, all our experiences here have been positive! Def recommend.

Sorry, no pics.... Too busy eating!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X29lSld3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,"The atmosphere was calm and relax. The waiter/waitress were bubbly and friendly to all the customers. We had a great time and wonderful food during our last visit for my spouse's birthday celebration. As usual, a complimentary cake for the birthday person."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLU02RHl3RRAB,The Malayan Council,4,"Attended a wedding there. It was intimate & cosy. Though only comment for improvement would be to check the quality of the food as we were served seafood (prawns & lobster) which I personally felt was not too fresh. Other than that staff did well to host everyone, check on all tables & ensure we were well fed. Thanks for the experience!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNGR1cWVREAE,The Malayan Council,5,The restaurant is beautiful! It looks like a wedding venue too~ thank you for the superb customer service and I'm really thankful for the complimentary appetizer and cakes. Such a lovely and generous restaurant 💕 really appreciate the gesture. The waiters were very polite and had good service too. Enjoyable dining experience ~ always a good meal at the malayan council
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdGRPRWRnEAE,The Malayan Council,4,"Had a reservation for a birthday celebration. Food was great! The drinks were expensive but felt that it was worth the experience and turned out to be great. Got a couple of complimentary items too, most likely due to the birthday reservation (Malayan wings and put piring cake). Upon payment, got an additional 2 complimentary cakes (ondeh ondeh and put piring) to bring home, not too sure why though but loving the freebies 😁

Though service can be slow when it gets crowded (hence the 4 stars), the ambience was great for the occasion. Overall, will definitely be back for more special occasions."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b2J5Sy1RRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,Dinner serving is awesome. Great ambience for a meet up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eTRqQVR3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,"Many many thanks to Ash, Ady and Alexis for the great hospitality. Always feel so welcome @ Malayan Council and food, as always, is amazinggg! So if you are a foodie and an Instagram addict, this place is for you, people!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM2VfREpBEAE,The Malayan Council,1,"Went to the Winstedt outlet. The service don't even deserve 1 star. Very bad experience. Went to celebrate a family member's birthday but ended up waiting 2 hours before we finally got our food. Very disappointed.  The restaurant had a birthday celebration going on, so we would've understood a slight delay in preparing our orders. But the restaurant paid more attention in preparing food for the birthday event with little regard for the other paying customers. We saw more than 20 customers cancelling their orders due to the super long waiting time. The restaurant could have been better organised... or dedicate different sections of the kitchen to cater to the different types of customers (i.e. event booking and walk-in). Service sucks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bDZpVktnEAE,The Malayan Council,1,"Worst service ever experienced. Waiter served dessert right after our starter. We declined having it and he rolled his eyes. It wasn’t a busy night but didn’t refill our cup of water. Requested to make order for takeaway but didn’t come back. Returned the same plate of dessert with melted ice cream at the end of our meal. Requested to change the ice cream. Came back with messy plates smeared with the melted ice cream around the plate, and added new ice cream on top of it. Served without spoons. Had to wait for spoons. Embarrassing cause I brought my bosses to this restaurant. Never coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNHBTcHJRRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"Dined here for the first time with a group of friends. The ambience and food were great but the service was even better. We were well looked after by the crew; very friendly and attentive.

Likely not a typical occurrence but they were very generous on the evening we visited. They kept serving us food we did not order and then explained to us they were on the house 😂"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdjhmbFlBEAE,The Malayan Council,4,"Food quality and portion was great as always. However, the crowd that weekend was bustling and that made the main course arrived late, an hour late to be exact. Ambience was nice, staff service was tip top, they always try to accommodate requests at their best. Location-wise, not that easy to get to but you can drive or take a Grab down. It's located not too far off the Newton Food Centre."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjliRzRRRRAB,The Malayan Council,5,"We came in for a late dinner on Monday 17 Jul 22. Despite not making any reservations, the team still accepted our group of 3.
We were served by AYU who was very pleasant and accommodating.
Hats off to the team for their amazing service!
The food was awesome and the portion was humangous. Each main course is filling enough for 2 pax."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dThDcnRBRRAB,The Malayan Council,2,"We had two consecutive bad experience at Malayan Council, both at different outlets. Didn’t want to patronise the place again after our first bad experience but since we were invited to a family’s birthday dinner, we thought ‘why not’ to giving it a second chance. Sadly, our second experience only reinforced our views on the restaurant.

The outlet at Windstedt was severely understaffed and it reflected poorly on their service. None of the staff were available to attend to us and a few other diners who, like us, have been raising our hands for some time to get their attention. My husband was directed to the counter instead when he walked up to a staff to make additional orders. He ended up going to the counter but even that, he was made to wait a good 5-10 minutes to be attended to. When we requested for our desserts to be served, the dessert plates and utensils were placed on our tables, but the cakes only came about 20 minutes later with half melted ice cream. We saw that it was already prepared on the counter but it wasn’t served to us. Extremely disappointed as the cake surprise was simply ruined by the long wait. We would like to highlight that we are not blaming the staff working that night but hope that management would look into the understaff matter seriously, especially during weekend service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMjZXaUdBEAE,The Malayan Council,3,"Malay cuisine with a modern twist. Love the quietness on a Tuesday lunch, just 6 in the restaurant including the 2 of us. Nice aircon restaurant for hot day. Price is a little high I find though they did a pleasant surprise at service and take-away. We ordered :-

Lychee mint
Iced long black
Cereal fish & chips 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
- no pic but the cereal fish was very delicious and came with a lot of fries
Prawn Tahu Telor 👍🏻
- delicious but perhaps look into the proportion of tahu to egg crisp
Chicken Wings (comp) 👍🏻
Durian Cake (comp)

Thank you for the lovely gesture !

Visitation : apr 20, 2021"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anB6dHZnRRAB,The Malayan Council,3,"Food is unique and portions were big, but not mind blowing and price is on the steep side.

Ondeh-Ondeh cake is a crowd favorite with gula melaka bits in between the layers!

Staff are also attentive and polite!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcV9xOEVREAE,The Malayan Council,5,"Amazing experience for my birthday celebration two nights ago! Food was delicious as always, portions were huge too. The lambshank mandhi I ordered was tender and soft. Ondeh2 cake tasted great too. Always loved the Malayan Council hospitality, as experienced at other outlets 👍🏼 Thank you to the friendly staff for making sure we enjoyed our dinner there!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aEl6OTB3RRAB,The Malayan Council,5,Ive been to the bussorah outlet a few times. Decided to celebrate my birthday at winstedt this time. It was simply fabulous. Our server was new but she was so bubbly and friendly it was a joy to have her host us this evening.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeUx2UVZ3EAE,The Malayan Council,5,An excellent place to host farewell.  5 of us visited the restaurant at Windstedt. Was impressed with the service by a serve staff Siti. Very warm and bubbly personality. Good in recommending thecashtypes of menu to choose both for main and desserts.  Malayan Council must be blessed to have her as server . Credit shod go to the cashier fir her waym personality.  Overall we had a great time there. We will definitely patronise the restaurant again. Thanks to them and the wide range of fusion food served
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcXE3Y1hnEAE,The Malayan Council,3,"Generously huge serving portions, food tasted quite average, slow service as restaurant seemed under staffed. Service quality by staffs also sub par. Was given complimentary wings and a slice of cake without asking though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHakxPR1FBEAE,Nurilah Malay Food,5,"Wow came here and eat at 4pm still they serve the food item hot and yummy.

Chicken wings is must :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWUtSDNRRRAB,Nurilah Malay Food,5,I like their Mee Soto
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bk8yd1lnEAE,Nurilah Malay Food,2,Mee siam was too sugary sweet.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cXZYaHZ3RRAB,Nurilah Malay Food,5,Awesome Nasi Lemak and Nasi Padang!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc3BEZ09nEAE,Sedap!,4,Interesting Nasi Lemak! Good choices available. I like the flavour of the rice and it's chicken. The combinations is interesting. I do find it a bit pricey but they make up with taste. Will try again when possible.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMFlHdFRREAE,Sedap!,4,"This place has a home cooked feel about it. The staff are friendly and understanding but not overly stiff.

I ordered classic basic nasi lemak and chose my own sides.  I feel that it may have been more economical to just purchase one of their sets. The beef rendang was soft and the sauce was nice. What I do appreciate is that it had less salt in all of their food.  They make their own Chile which was not too spicy.

I take one star off because 1 plate of food plus 1 drink set me back $10. I won't be able to afford to eat here that regularly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNkt1QnN3RRAB,Sedap!,5,A very surprised find out of such quaint place for very nice nasi lemak! The Color from butterfly pea didn’t affect coconut rice at all and over such a pleasant looking and great tasting dish!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaF9leE1REAE,Sedap!,5,"For its quality (very decent nasi lemak) and air-conditioned setting, the meal is fairly priced. And the folks serving behind the counter are friendly too! It is definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjZxaVhREAE,Sedap!,5,Amazing nasi lemak and loved the a la carte options. And the fried chicken — crunchy and fresh! Super sweet service from the women working there too. Thank you! Will definitely be back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteDVYOTZBRRAB,Sedap!,3,"Quick and decent meal.
Rice: not fragrant enough
Rendang: average, wished it was more tender.

It seems like there are different sambal to choose from. I had the sambal xo and felt it was awesome."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHYzakhBEAE,Sedap!,1,"Chicken curry and beef rendang are tough, nasi lemak no flavor at all, i didnt finish and left, waste my $$$"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnN5Ym1BRRAB,Sedap!,5,"Delicious butterfly pea dyed Nasi lemak. Set with chicken wing (choice of regular or turmeric) is a good buy.

The sambal is perfect, ikan bilis and peanuts very crunchy and yummy. Liked the food so much decided to pack it home for family. Will definitely be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOWRYN3pnRRAB,Sedap!,5,"Very nice Nasi Lemak, better than other Chains. Always the comfort food when we come to United square"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLTVITnhnRRAB,Sedap!,5,Not bad! I tried their setC which is rendang beef set. Recommended. It come with blue colored nasi lemak!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMlp2NThRRRAB,Sedap!,5,Great food and friendly staffs. Will come again. The chili is homemade and awesome!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM3VQdDdnRRAB,Sedap!,5,"One of the best nasi lemak ever. I am not even exaggerating. I had the rendang set with achar instead of sayur lodeh. Beef Rendang was tender and flavourful. Fried egg has runny yolk just the way I like it. A generous portion of nuts and anchovies. The most important piece of this plate of deliciousness, the sambal. There are 4 sambal to choose from, unable to decided the lady gave me two to try out and even offer a top up later. In my opinion, the portion was perfect, i had a delicious lunch. There are a lot of customisation options available so you can build your own perfect plate of nasi lemak. Highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN09tSjNBRRAB,Sedap!,5,Nice Nasi Lemak that goes well with the fiery-kick XO sambal. The ayam masak merah is good add-on to complete my breakfast 🙂
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHalBiVkRnEAE,Sedap!,5,Good value nasi lemak sets! Blue pea rice was delicious! Love the beef rendang and fried chicken sets! Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhbmRQbmpnRRAB,Sedap!,5,"Fantastic nasi lemak at a great price. Beef rendang is tender and not too salty, blue pea coconut rice is delish. Thanks for the great delivery order"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNDl1YWRnEAE,Sedap!,5,"I’ve been to Sedap several times and the food never disappoint and is really really sedap (mouth watering); especially the chicken wings, beef rendang, otah otah, etc. Recently Sedap also serve salmon fish head curry which was surprisingly good and delicious (it has kind of more softer & jelly-like parts compared to other fish head). Definitely a must try dish for my next visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eHMyaWpBRRAB,Sedap!,5,"Walked in just to try. Thought it would just be another nasi lemak eating place. Surprisingly good. Ikan bilis was good, not salty. Crispy hot chicken wings. Blue rice and sambal were good. Good service too. Will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbC1PQmtBRRAB,Sedap!,5,"Nasi Lemak is an all-time comfort food. Love the variety of side dishes offered at Sedap! My favourite has to be the steamed otah, so yums! They recently opened at Galaxis too which is nearer to me, so happy! Thank you for the good food and warm service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzhYZjRBRRAB,Sedap!,1,"Food, tasty.  Service ... definitely not coming back."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbHZPVFNBEAE,Sedap!,5,"One of the best nasi lemak that similar to Malaysian’s one! Generous portion, reasonable price and awesome customization available"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaXRfVFV3EAE,Sedap!,5,Very delicious nasi lemak especially the sambal tumis. The side dishes are equally delicious too. 👍🏻 to Sedap.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMWZPX0VnEAE,Sedap!,5,Loved the nasi lemak taste and especially the chicken wing. Sedap!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMmFmMVpBEAE,Sedap!,5,Best nasi lemak in the world. Must try when you are visit singapore!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MnVudWVREAE,Sedap!,5,Great rendang and otah! Love it. Friendly staff. I love how spicy my beef rendang is. Will visit again! :)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa05lWTNBRRAB,Sedap!,3,"Overrated. Wished I had stuck to the food court next door,  where nasi lemak taliwang has a stall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdHFXVnhBRRAB,Sedap!,5,Blue coloured nasi lemak rice! Must try!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLXNtYXVBRRAB,Sedap!,4,Delicious value for money great ingredients combination
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcmRyOGxBRRAB,Sedap!,1,Horrible portion.  Threw away the food after seeing the pathetic portion and no more appetite.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjX2M3N0N3EAE,Sedap!,5,"Been patronizing for the past 2 years. Friendly staffs, amazing and affordable food.!! Keep it up.!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4aGUzc2tnRRAB,Sedap!,5,Needing a nasi lemak fix and thinking of Sedap once more!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVM09TX1ZREAE,Sedap!,5,"Delicious food and tastes authentic
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻staff are also very patient"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdThqeEVREAE,Sedap!,5,"(Translated by Google) Best Nasi Lemak ever! Chicken wing was juicy and tasty and hand-made Peanuts & Ikan Bilis and Achar were yummy. You can choose different level of sambal chili. I took with blue coconut rice, Kukus Kerabu. Beautiful presentation and hospitality of the store owner was the reason of my recommendation! There are 3-4 outlets on the island, but Nasi Lemak is here! Is recommended. SG5-6th place ~

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbU1uM1Z3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Loved having dinner here with my friend

Tom Yam (clear) soup was superb. Such a clean taste. The tartness was just right. The fluffy crabmeat omelette was wonderful. Enjoyed the stir fried soft shell crab too; very flavourful. Didn't like the stuffed chicken wings though. The meat was marinated well, the stuffing was a bit dry and not as well flavoured as it could be. Green curry chicken was a great portion and the gravy was thick and yummy with rice!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ0lmOEhnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"We came at around 8.30pm to 9pm on a weekday evening and were surprised that we were allowed to still come in for a meal this late.  The food came quickly.  The chili spiciness was just nice - unlike some places that make your eyes water just by looking at the dish.  The dishes are a bit sweet, but that seems to be how Thai food is.  The atmosphere was relaxed and we didn't feel hurried to leave even though it was late.  Great service from YiXin and Sue.  Thank you very much for being so accommodating and friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cDVlVVNnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"Had our dinner here.
Hard copy menu price was outdated, so scan QR Code can see the latest price.

Crowded during dinner time, but staffs working efficiency, fast action to sort out the seat for us.

Table arrangement quite close to each other, so perhaps is good place to eat but not stay long.

We ordered some simple dishes, overall all taste are nice and yummy.

Personally feel the mango sticky rice little pricy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeWJHR29BRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"A wonderful experience. From entry to end. Was attended to the moment arrive at Restaurant. As prior reservation was done, brought to the table immediately. Lucky to get a window seat!
Vast variety of food on the classice menu style. Provides an overall easy to browse pages with pictures illustrations for their popular dishes.
Food and drinks came quick. All were freshly cooked and had uts own taste, not too powerful or overpowering in spices.
Staff was attentive throughout, clears dirty dishes as and when emptied.
Will totally visit again. Good place to bring clients for a meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cnV5WUpBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,Delicious Thai cuisine and efficient service on the whole. The seafood clear Tom yum soup was appetizing & not too spicy. Prawn cake taste nice.  Was a lovely dining experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaWZLVVRnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"1st time trying this place, recommended by friends. Few good dishes that I like, including the prawns omelette, which is not that oily. Prawn cake is nice too. On the whole, recommended with 4-stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MnBYZ3ZnRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"Service was good. Crackers served as appetizer / snack came with chili sauce was perfect match, tasted good. The main dishes like pad Thai, belacan fried rice and clear seafood tomyam was also served within short time, tasted good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHBfempnRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,1,"I and my friend and the kids dined for lunch today. It was the first time in our lives that a restaurant server can speak rudely. We found a hair strand in the tom yum soup after having 2 spoons…. She was insisting that its a lemongrass strand… because she could not find the hair strand in the tom yum soup. She kept saying seeing is believing… After all that fiasco that took place, i happened to find the hair strand and there was no sorry or whatsoever from her. The way she spoke to us is not nice at all. She even mentioned that she will not remove the tom yum soup from the bill. We clearly told her its not about the bill.. we just want to inform you that their is a hair strand inside the tom yum. We ordered alot
Of food. Surprising to hear that tone of speaking. Then while paying at the counter we spoke to the owner… he did not even apologise and mentioned its a lemongrass strand. I told him i already showed your staff its a hair strand and she acknowledged it.
Waste of time to even go to such restaurants.
Service has dropped tremendously.. used to frequent this place in the past alot since funan center.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydU9haFNBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,A very good lunch sans the stuffed chicken wings (cannot compare to YingThai's - lacks finesse and flavour). The food suits those with zhòng kǒu wèi (strong flavour) as it is well-seasoned but not too sweet. Especially love the baby kailan and very fresh fish.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbHBYT0tBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"Super disappointed by the tamarind prawn soup with vegetables (item 18A). For $15.90++, it had two tiny measly prawns. Veggies were cabbage, broccoli and carrot - which were too raw. And the soup was too spicy to drink - even though we had requested ""less spicy"" at the point of ordering but told that it is not spicy.

Thankfully the stuffed fried chicken wings redeemed the meal somewhat - these were juicy and flavourful. Not cheap either though.

Not great for a first experience, but we will give it another shot (without this soup)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHd2N5ckxnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Great food but slightly expensive.

Tom Yum Prawn Soup is very aromatic and spicy and was the best amongst the order.

Red curry is also very good and not too spicy with amazing flavours.

Pandan chicken wasn’t good as the meat was chewy and not succulent. Had to leave it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLUliS1J3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"We tried a number of Thai restaurant, the food here are pretty ok..the omelette is good but 5pcs of Thai fishcake for $18.90 is expensive..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyay1XU1R3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"Food is good and service efficient. I ordered Thai ice milk tea, iced lemongrass, basil minced pork, Beansprouts and salted egg + chye poh egg.

The only dish I find lacking is the egg. It was too oily and I felt quesy after consuming it. I had to use napkin to soak up some oil and the napkin was soaked through.

Everything else was very yummy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTlXcmh3RRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Amazing food, every dish was superb! Would definitely come again! We ordered fish green curry, shrimp pancake 3pcs, scrambled omelette with minced pork, stir fry kai lan, Thai iced tea and a coconut shake."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2X1pYU3dBRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"5 star rating for a long standing restaurant, 3 decades. We set for a vegetarian meal, no regrets. Keep it up and will become my regular spot for Thai food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaDd1Y0x3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,Scrumptious thai food! The pork belly is a must have!! 🔥🔥🔥 staff was friendly and even recommended us dishes to try when asked! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2LXJuY3lRRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"Ordered:
- grilled pork which has the very good balance of the fats and meat. I absolutely love this and will definitely come back for this (only if I’m forgoing my diet 😂)
- clear Tom yum which has a mild sour  and spicy taste. Felt that i might enjoy it more if it’s more sour and spicy as it tastes just mehhhhh. Lots of squids, fish and mushroom tho!
- omelette crab where the egg was very very fluffy yet crispy on the outer. But I can’t taste the flavour of crab and I had this dish thinking it’s just plain egg (my cousin said it will be better to order the prawn omelette so that u can see the prawn meat)
- pad Thai tasted like the normal pad Thai (honestly can someone share with me how a plate of amazing pad Thai should taste? With wokhey??? 😂😂😂)
- kailan which tasted quite clean yet doesn’t have the glassy taste (if you are like me who hates vegetables, this is a perfect option for you cos it doesn’t have the vegetables taste 😂)
- Thai green tea had a very strong pandan taste and normal Thai iced tea was a little sweet (but I like it) and has the dry tea after taste (which I believe is normal to have)

Ambience was good, but it’s not enticing enough that would bring me back so 3 stars especially since food was decent"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcjdPVkZ3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Check out ig: @oyinshii

Authentic thai restaurant with extremely great flavors! Staff were friendly and we strongly recommend the steamed fish, pad thai and yom yum gong."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NWUtaGtRRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Fantastic meal here at A-Roy Thai. Was a Sunday night around 8+ but the restaurant was still bustling, will recommend to make a reservation if you come during the peak dinner timings.

The meal itself was delightful, not the regular local style Thai food but according to my gf, it had more Northern Thai influences to it but more importantly, done well.

Prices are not cheap, 1 appetizer, 3 mains and 2 drinks set us back around $90+ compared to the regular Thai food places but this is money well spent.

The lemongrass salad was fantastic, a must order (the staff don't tell you but you eat it with the wrap on the side). Tom yum kung was good, not mind blowing but definitely above average. The Grilled Pork was done very differently, in a good way, a spicier way actually.

The service was friendly and the food came out surprisingly fast. The grilled pork took a bit longer but the rest of the dishes came first.

Would definitely return! But have to budget myself else it'd really burn a huge hole in my pocket!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaU5DdDJnRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"Nice cosy joint for authentic Thai food. Will overall recommend with below dishes tried:

-Crisy garlic fried pork belly : really good recommendation by the staff. This is not on the menu but has fantastic flavours. Wasn’t overly fatty as well.

-steam seabass with spicy sour soup

- Chili Kang Kong is pretty standard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX3AtMjNnRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,2,"ordered a crabmeat fried rice.... didnt see any crab meat but tasted some chunks of meat that tasted like those kind of dried meat.. my friend ordered a tom tum fried rice, no taste of tomyum just taste like tomato fried rice :') price point was okay for that area (since it's novena) but $13+ for fried rice is not too good esp since didnt taste any crab 🥲"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyalBlb2VBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,Excellent Thai food. The pictures says it all. Great service

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dU9yUkR3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,Food is good and tasty. claypot seafood noodle is so so.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MHVEQ0xREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"For a local spot in novena , this spot is really good! The large selection and everything came out hot and fresh. A spot we want to expore more. Their coconut jelly dessert is available for to-go at the counter and was really good and refreshing. Pricing was ok but we enjoyed the food enough. It was $114 for 4 people with dessert. Not bad and will be back. Enjoy !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a0ktQi1BRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"Food smells very good when walking pass. Complimentary prawn crackers and Tom yum soup was good. Drinks were quite nice too. Ordered the butterfly pea lime soda and the Thai milk tea. The rest of the food were ok at best. Garlic pork belly and Poo Ja (shrimp and meat in crab shell)  was too peppery, Crab meat fried rice was bland and did not have wok hey. Not worth the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNGVlWGF3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,The flavours were ok but the quality and freshness not really there. The best dishes were the beef Thai green curry and the fish cake.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla0oyVDBRRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"My family has dined at Aroy Thai for over 20 years from when they used to be at Siglap and Funan. I’ve had the food from their East Coast outlet quite recently too but it was our first time at the Novena branch and the quality was even better!

We were there on a weekday for lunch around 1.40pm and thankfully there were quite a few empty tables. Service was really prompt and our first dish arrived less than 3 mins after our order was placed! We had the pad thai, garlic kailan, seafood tomyum soup, grilled pork and stuffed chicken wings. Even though we had asked for the soup to be less spicy, it was still pretty potent so it’s best to ask them to dial back on the spiciness if you’re not someone who can handle it well.

The portions were also pretty big and we had some leftovers. Very glad that the quality has stayed great over the years!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNk12RWFBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"It was a beautiful Sunday and my friends and I decided to go for Thai food after our hiking at Macritche Reservoir. One of our friends decided to bring us to Velocity where she was frequent at A-Roy Thai Restaurant. We were there at 11am where the restaurant was just open. We were ushered by a friendly waitress and directed our seats at the corner. First impression counts though. I was pretty much happy the way the waitress welcomed us, so much poise and professionalism. The ambience was nice and cosy. I ordered the Thai Milk Tea and I love it so much. The flour just right and not too sweet. We ordered 3 dishes which they are beyond delicious and authentic. Love the Thai foods here...definitely you must try! I shared some pictures of the foods we ordered. As a whole experience at this A-Roy Restaurant, I will give 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaWJtLWZREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"The food here is super authentic. It reminds me of the trips to thailand in the past. I tried the otah (the one in the coconut). I felt that it was really special. The otah had more ""coconut"" taste in it and it was more flavourful than the other otahs i had. The rest of the food are okay. The quality is there. Prices on the high side. The staff were very attentive as well. Remember to reserve your seats or be prepared to wait!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbXFqRktREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"I had high expectations for this restaurant, but it was not as good I thought. The place was noisy, and the food was low quality. For example, when I ordered pineapple rice, I expected rice with pineapple, but turned out to be yellow pineapple flavoured rice. However, the drinks were quite yummy. It only took about 6 minutes for our food to be served. My overall opinion about this restaurant is that it is noisy, the food is ok, and it is usually crowded."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbk5Mb01BEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Authentic Thai food with generous portion. Ambience is nice and staffs are attentive. The price is on the more expensive side than other Thai restaurants, but the authentic taste is worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOWRYT1B3EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"Went there for family celebration. Food is ok, cooked decently for most dishes. Cuisine isn't much to my liking for some.

Seating is a bit congested so if you have a large group (>8 pax), expect to split up.

Mostly longish tables too so sharing food can be a bit messy or troublesome."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvLTl2RUZBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,We were not hungry but wanted to eat something before going home. One of my Mom favourite restaurant. The starters is always welcome crackers which we both loved. The fish head ohta (not sure of the spelling) is nice. Loved the mango salad. Tom yum here is very good - best shared.

Whenever i have the craving for thai food, they will be the 1st to come in my mind. The only place to find vegetarian spicy and sour tom yam clear soup etc. Highly recommended and sure you won't regret 😀"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaHVUZ1hREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"Went there for my friend's birthday dinner.  The staff who took our order was quite friendly and introduced us a few popular dishes.
The stuffed chicken wings were ok, not something fantastic. Prawn cake was nice.. Green curry didn't seem appetizing to me but my friends enjoyed it. The mango sticky rice was good.. mango was sweet and rice was soft and warm.
I had lychee milkshake but it tasted more like blended lychee.. watery not nice.
We also ordered red ruby and something like cendol. The red ruby dessert had something that tasted like essence.  Don't recommend it.

We finished out dinner and sat there to chill and chat but the staff were eager to settle the bill and send us off.. they could tell us nicely that they are preparing to close for the day instead of throwing very obvious hints like mopping the floor.  :-/"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJM1pTeFJnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Wonderful thai food!! Everything is wonderful, especially the lemongrass salad. We ordered: olive fried rice, stuffed chicken wings, Kang kong, fried fish, Tom yum soup, pad gra pow, glass noodles. The balance of sweet, sour, spicy and salty in the dishes were great.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d0xYMXV3RRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,Best Thai food in Singapore and it's not even close. Been a customer for over a decade (when they were at Siglap and Funan). The staff are super as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcUwtQ2VnEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,"Very nice service took the menu to come serve us to speed up the process! Thai milk tea a must to order!
Love the service and the food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMFphMFNREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,"i would.say the.best thai food here, it has been for sometime never disappoint. the pricing is not cheap. the issue here is the plastic plateware. it is a shame such delicious food served not on china plateware. thats the only improvement needed. service was fast and lunch crowd build ip fast. come early"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODc2MFVREAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,Most Thai restaurants in Singapore are either 1- fancy and pricey 2- down and dirty or 3- cooked for non Thais so not authentic. A-Roy Thai is different. It is just like the Thai food you would get in Thailand. That's because it's run by a family from Udon Thani who bring the chef in from their home town and keep the food real. The Isaan dishes are best but the dishes from throughout the country are all pretty good. A family member is usually there (ask for Chayut). Beers are cold. Service is fast. Please enjoy the best Thai food in Singapore
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcDQzNU53EAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,5,Loved this quaint little Thai place. Food is authentic and good! Especially loved the shrimp lemongrass salad! Almost everything is good. Will come back for the Pad Thai!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeGJDbmtnRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,"The food is better than most thai restaurant in Singapore. Was very surprise their north eastern thai dishes (larb moo) is very close to what you would have in thailand.

Fried pork was slightly hard, and the marinade was hardly present. Fish cake was so-so.

Their stuff chicken Wings was rather good though. Crispy on the outside, tasty on the inside.

Food is only slightly more expensive as compare to most thaifood places. Golden Mile Seems to charge a premium for it.

Overall every good Experience, will still return."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbzdTNnF3RRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,Looks authentically Thai but the truth is in the pudding. Mixed reaction for me. While the taste is overall pretty OK but the authenticity for 2 of the dishes - otah n grilled pork seems a bit lacking. Still I liked the grilled fish n tarmarin soup. 3.5 star for now. Will revisit in future and try the other dishes.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZc3JxcWJBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,4,One of my favourite thai restaurant. Reasonably priced and very extensive menu. Not too crowded on weekdays. Recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNHRtZjFRRRAB,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,2,Slightly over priced for what they are offering. Their recipes actually does not have Authentic Thai taste... It's kind of Chinese-Thai taste. Coconut milk shake is totally artificial flavored not even a single ingrident of coconut. Look out for other Thai restaurants in city if you have time...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OHNTQVZBEAE,A-Roy Thai Restaurant,3,The food is good but is consider expensive as compared to other Thai restaurants. First time try and find it too expensive.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbk1LV1VnEAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,5,"Will happily go back to eat the set A with the fried chicken wing. Added on: Eggplant & curry veg ✅nice crispy anchovies and peanuts. Most of the food was cold by the time I was there about 8pm, but was still good. They were still frying certain food items but mostly sold out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHc2RQUGhBRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,3,"$3.50 for a choice of A, B or C basis set. Not the cheapest, but addition of sambal goreng for $1, and the same for a piece of Otak was much more reasonable.

Coconut milk rice with a drop of pandan leaf juice giving it a slight green hue and stronger fragrance. Chicken wing was overcooked and dry. Sambal sweet. Everything else was real normal.

Average. So I don't understand the constant line seen here. Thankfully fast moving."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aV9QNjBnRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,5,"Not sure if they will be increasing their price, but the quality of the food has not dropped since lots of things happening since 2022, Noticed that they changed their stall location, and that the newer generation has taken over the stall, the Chicken wings are the best to pair with their fragrant rice, and their sambal is top notch as well.

Will definitely visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajlLRm1nRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,4,"Decent nasi lemak served with green fragrant rice. Coconut taste is present in the rice, chilli is not overpowering and ikan bilis complements the dish quite well. Fried chicken wing was not too tough nor soggy. $3.50 is also a decent price for the meal, which is slightly above standard to those nasi lemak stalls going for $2.50-$3."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaTlMSHBBRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,4,"I arrvied at about 11:45am, no queue. $3.50 set comes with 1 egg, 1 chicken wing, peanut & ikan bilis. Added Otah $1.

Rice has mild pandan & coconut fragrance, not over whelming but just nice.

Chilli goes well with rice, not as spicy though to me.

Chicken wings is crispy and well seasoned."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeUltWi1BRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,3,"When I saw the long queue for this, i knew i had to join in to check it out!

This is ""Hi Leskmi"" which is quite an unusual name that sells Nasi Lemak.  The stall uses an Indian name, owned by a Chinese guy, selling Malay Food. Talk about Racial Harmony!

Rice itself I feel is not really fragrant, and the Chicken Drumstick itself while Crispy, is nothing special. Sambal Chilli is sweetish. The whole meal however comes together quite well and is very filling. Not really worth queuing up for tbh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0xfZEdnEAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,"This store used to be decent before covid. Its standards were already dropping in 2019 but decided to give it a try again.

Rice had no coconut taste and fragrance and was dry. Food ingredients were barely warm and nothing spectacular. Expensive too.

Hopefully can relook at what went wrong in the last few years.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNC1pTEJREAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,3,"A typical nasi lemak at Whampoa. The queue is Long, cause of its pricing(pretty affordable). I’m a fan of nasi lemak and I must say this is just an average nasi lemak. The rice can be better(slightly mushy when I ate it) but it’s side dishes are good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbGR5azZ3RRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,2,After a 2 year break (thanks COVID) had a chance to try this again. Have to say I am very disappointed as the price vs quality and quantity has dropped by so much. There is much better fare to spend your $ and appetite on in this place
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMzRiMXZRRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,5,Really the most fragrant rice and chicken wing for Nasi lemak! 👍🏼
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtanR5UXVRRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,3,"During my recent visit, I find their sambal and coconut rice standard are not as good compared to when they start up."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMEpPN0xBEAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,5,"Noticed they changed to a slightly inner store (same row, opposite side beside Shirley desserts)
but standard still same, Rice is fragrant, chicken wing still has the crisp and tender texture (fresh),"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbkp2bG1BRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,3,Rice is very fragrant. All is good but the chicken wing seems soggy at the skin and the flesh is hard. Service is also very fast and good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NTZIMXBRRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,5,"Best nasi lemak in Singapore. Rice is fragrant, chicken wings are crispy. Everything on point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcDltMVh3EAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,"Super unfriendly, only want exact amount. If need change he won't let you buy and basically forces u to get extra dishes so he doesn't have to give you change. Lastly it's only so-so never understood why there's always a queue there anyway"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBa0p5bExBEAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,I spend $14 for 2packets. Ask for more chillies  didnt give and definitely not enough to cover the rice. Will not visit this stall anymore. They are so lousy!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd05LQ1lREAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,These guys are super rude and arrogant. Both the younger and old guys are rude to the customers. First off the nasi lemak is just average but sometimes there is a queue. I think he has enough business and that made him very arrogant and atrocious. Bad service and very bad attitude.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dW9xNkdnEAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,Rice is hard. Fried chicken got smell. Otah and egg is edible.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMjdEc1pREAE,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,4,Food is good. Wings are extra crispy. Long queue always.  Be prepared for the wait because its worth the wait.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbE12dTlnRRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,1,"The nasi lemak is really so so only. The young man behind the stall is rude & unfriendly. A waste of stomach space, time & money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRa2VYSXR3RRAB,Hi Leskmi Nasi Lemak,4,Nice Nasi Lemak. Long Queue although quite fast moving. Understand the stall caught fire recently.

I stunned for a while before mastering courage to ask her nicely, eh how much is the meehoon...she straight away replied me you gave me $5 right? The answer is like giving her away. She then threw $5 on the counter for me. They need to be fired!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbHNqRUFREAE,Old Chang Kee,1,"Poor customer service , the Chinese lady staff was very rude."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMXFqdm9BRRAB,Old Chang Kee,5,"One of the more famous snack brands in Singapore. Fun fact, most of their employees are senior citizens! Their food may not be special but their staff will certainly make you feel at home!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaTlycm5nRRAB,Old Chang Kee,1,Buying snacks for customers but system maintenance cant issue receipt. Waited 10mins system stil not up. Ock should consider having manual receipt as backup so as not to lose some business as a result

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ejhITldBEAE,Warung Wahyu,4,"Shop has a great variety of Malay food, looks very legit and old school.  Nasi Lemak sold out before 1030am, so i try the Lontong.   Gravy is flavorful and serving is generous.  Missing the sweet coconut flaks and felt incomplete.  Rice cake also not the chewy type and lack texture. Vegetables also a bit overcooked and gravy is not hot as it is not kept hot in a pot but part of the Nasi Padang spread.  Had tasted better lontongs in Toa Payoh stalls.  But can eat if you like your lontong vegetables to be well cooked. Coffee from the drink stall is good though.

Will be back to try other offerings of their Malay food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxekxlUWZREAE,Warung Wahyu,4,"Curry puff is good and has nice spicy kick. Tried both the sardine and potato version. Good for $0.60 and happy to know I’ve got a place nearby!

Bergedil (potato patty) was also yums for $0.50 each! Recommended!

Veggie cucur was also good snack.

Sambal belachan is not as spicy as I’d expect.

Will definitely consider trying their other dishes as they have quite a queue."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bmMyRl9RRRAB,Warung Wahyu,4,Delicious nasi padang. Good items finish early. Long queues at lunch

Penang prawn mee broth is nice but ingredients seems dry and shrunk in size attributed to repeated cooking ."

Penang fried kway teow is well fried but popiah is a big let down. This place is fully packed after 11.30am so if you want to enjoy your food please come early.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMm9mdEtBEAE,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,"Have to agree with some of the reviewers here. The cleaners slam the utensils and talk way too loudly. The fried kway teow staff has attitude. I stood in front and the fella just ignored.

So I left and ordered the claypot rice. The young man disappeared for the longest time before he gave us our change. We then indicated we would like to purchase the drinks that came with the meal. The fella directed us to another store some distance away. And never gave us receipts. So we hard to make a second trip because the drinks stall asked for proof of paurchase.

First and last time at this lousy place.

Not happy to work, then don't. Customers are not responsible for your perceived lot in life."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcjViTlB3EAE,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,"Worst claypot chicken rice I've ever had. Just some pieces of chicken (with a lot of chicken skin), rice, and sauce being kept warm in a claypot. The rice wasn't even close to developing a crust."

I wanted to give 1 star,  but luckily the other senior staff who came back from outside and I asked him for little more soup he top it up without any hesitation.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0llT3dnRRAB,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,"Horrible service attitude and lousy food. Google states opening hours till 10pm. When arrived at 7.50-8pm, cook from the fried carrot stall mentioned that the claypot rice stall cook is having his meals rudely. So we ordered the Penang fried kway tiao while we waited. But taste of the CKT was way below average.

After the cook finished his meal, he just informed that his stall is closed! He should just mentioned it’s closed when we asked about it and we do not need to even order the Penang CKT!! Waste of time.

Place is also dirty with dead cockroach under the table. Horrible cleanliness.

Seriously Fei Siong group should manage the staff better. And UPDATE YOUR OPENING HOURS!!"

Claypot rice prepare by the fat guy is so so. Not enough meat and lap chiong. Not fragrant compare to hawker centre."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX05ydm5BRRAB,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,"My honest advice to the two young guys from fried kway teow and penang prawn mee stall, if this work is really that difficult for you, you can actually stop working here and move on
Terrible attitude against all customers
1. keep talking bad about customer in front of them
2. not even bother to take order from customer (pity the boss)
3. keep messing up with customer orders, customer need to wait another round because of the mistake (I don't understand because all customer ordering fried kway teow only, and it is like just 3 to 4 orders, but you still can make mistake?) plus you did wrong but still showing attitude to customer? (pity the customers)
4. one of the customer in front of me asked for non spicy, the staff from penang prawn mee shout very loud saying that can not choose no spicy, but when i get mine, it is not spicy at all (just because you want to do all orders in one go, you tell customer can not choose?)

At last, the food really so so only, so no more next time
No reason to get yourself insulted there for a food that not delicious and not to say very cheap"

when we got our omelette after about 60 mins of waiting, we only managed to find 4 oysters inside. mind you my mother paid $6 for that omelette.
the stall owners were very rude the entire time and took everything for granted. ruined family night and wasted our time."

Sure we understand the high rentals etc but charging $8 for subpar food and horrendous food portions not even fit for a cat is just too much.

The attitude of the hawkers are horrendous as well.

Malaysian food is cheap to begin with, cut with the pretense. Not recommended unless you are too rich and want your mood to be spoiled."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOXM2N0t3EAE,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,It don't even deserve one star at all. Lousy attitude especially from Char Kway Teow stall guy who just care more about looking at his hp then cooking. Know it could be due to high rental but the portion is just miserably small and the taste just doesn't do Malaysian food justice. Definitely 1 of the worst food places that I have been to. 😡
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVNDRLamVnEAE,Malaysia Chiak! @ Centrepoint,1,"Worst place ever.
Tried the Fried Kway Teow, tasteless.
Told the black shirt guy (supposed to be the manager) that I wanted it extra spicy, he didn't even bother.

Apr 2022: yet another visit in the same month! This time I tried the pumpkin porridge base and it was good! I think I got one of the last bowls and so the porridge was thick and yummy!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcy1qVExnEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,Happy to find this new favorite porridge place! The porridge is thick and flavourful. Fast and good service from the staff as well. They have pumpkin porridge option but felt could have more pumpkin taste. Nonetheless still really good and would be coming back for more 😄👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPalpENHNnRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,3,"It's okay, nothing too special about the porridge. No wok hei taste and one of my prawns was completely mushy, think their seafood is not very fresh.

Pretty generous with the ingredients though and the staff here are very enthusiastic and professional (esp the young boy who was attending to the tables)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPZ05XOURREAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,3,"The sliced pork porridge is thick and flavourful. We ordered a set hence there were you tiao and soya bean milk. The fried fritters and soya bean milk were average. The claypot liver had a few thick slices of liver but they were bland, only the sauce was nice. If you like porridge, then this is the place for you as there are many different choices of porridge (seafood, chicken, scallops, pork etc.)to select from and the dishes came quickly. Service was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTZIVEhnEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"I am not a fan of porridge but this place cooks up a yummy bowl that I would come back again.

The you tiao was surprisingly still crispy despite been left at counter for a while.

I had the mixed pork porridge which was really a mix of meat, internal organs, pork balls, fried, boiled into a flavourful bowl of porridge.

Wished I had the option white pepper, chives, oil. It was all added before served. Soya bean milk was a little sweeter than I would like."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbjg2Qm93RRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,"Was introduced by my sis that their porridge very nice and alots of varieties.
Mainly porridges but have some side dishes too.

We ordered with set (YouTiao & SoyMilk), the portion quite big, n their porridge more “thick” so easy to get full, most impt is yummy 👍
Price is reasonable too.

The shop is in the middle of others restaurant, first timer maybe need some time to look for it. Shop design is simple but is ok, I guess their main point is provide good & delicious food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX3RmMXRnRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,2,"The porridge is salted and the portion of the dish is very small. Especially for butter garlic lala, think only have less than 15pcs, and its not worth it."

1. Century egg & lean meat congee
2. Ginseng chicken drumstick congee

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbnBQSnpRRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,Feels like home cooked kind of food . The variety of congee is a dream . They have cheesy popcorn chicken congee to the favourite century egg congee. I chose claypot chicken today .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdjhqUUhnEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,Surprisingly nice porridge with many variety and tasty.  Many nice side dishes.  But price slightly on the higher side.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLTVXM0dREAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,1,"Just had 2 bowls of Mixed pork congee and a bowl of youtiao with mom. Conclusion, overrated and expensive. Weird smell coming from youtiao, there isn't 满粥, only 2/3 filled and a few pieces of meat. Worst is the fried intestines, like chewing rubber."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2by1xMmZnEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,"They are under Li Fang congee which I only found out when I saw their signboard. Like what many had mentioned, their pricing is more expensive. I still tried because their menu is quite interesting. The black chicken porridge is quite nourishing but annoying with the herbs hidden in the porridge, so go for others if you are not herbal fan. We paid like $30 for 2 pax. If you think of it as a meal at a restaurant then this price makes sense but if you wanna compare with hawker or coffeeshop then don't come. Overall we enjoyed our lunch there. 😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcHRmamZ3EAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,This has got to be one of the best congee stalls I’ve tried so far. Thick porridge. Chock full of quality ingredients. Costs almost twice as much as your typical hawker centre porridge but I guess you get what you pay for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX3A2eFpREAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,3,Small portions for the price. Porridge was otherwise tasty but lukewarm and had little ingredients.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjOUlmSzNnRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,3,"The porridge is really good but it's over priced. The portions of the dishes, especially vegetables are really small. A plate of veg at about $8 is only enough of 1 person. So if you order a set meal say the grouper fish slice porridge with a bit of youtiao and a soya bean drink and you add a veg to it, it'll cost you around $22 without the ++."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OWJxWFN3EAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,"Usually come here for porridge. But thought i try their tim sum. Variety is not wide, but quality is good. I had pork ribs. The portion is generous n taste is delicious 😋.  Had the spring roll; crisp n fresh. They have a new item, if you like otah n in mood for the fusion of it, come try their cheese otah. Taste of otah remains with added chewy cheese. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c292Z1N3EAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,2,"My toman fish porridge set with added egg was ordered through GrabFood.

The congee is good. The thinly sliced ginger added nice contrast against the congee. However there was little toman fish slices in my bowl (4 slices to be exact). When I finally got to the bottom of the bowl, there was also the shocking absence of any egg.

Even after delivery, the oily stick chunks remained acceptably hard (not exactly crispy) instead of softening. The oily stick chunks were quite ok after soaking in congee.

Soy milk was as good as their congee. Pleasant tasting and at 30% sugar, not perceptibly sweet.

I probably would order again, but this time, avoid adding any additional items."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbTlILWZBEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,The porridge here is very good. Many varieties. Try the minced meat porridge. The set is additional $1.8 where you get one soy bean and youtiao. Goes well with the hot porridge
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaUxfQ19nRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"Good congee specialist in the Novena area. Wide selection with some dim sum and side dish options. Congee is smooth and quite flavourful. Could do with more 'wok hei' for greater impact. Nonetheless, one of the better ones around."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcWNqenBRRRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,Love the porridge. It tasted very good but took sometimes to get the order. No queue but waiting time about 20 minutes plus to get the order on lunch time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNczRTRnN3RRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"Savory porridge! Tried the pork meatballs with sliced pork - TBH ingredients weren’t to shout for, but the porridge made it up for it :) think they cook the ingredients in the porridge to let the marinate and sweetness soak through.
Ingredient portions were pretty generous. Price-wise - depending on ingredients, betw $5.50-$10plus."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNWUzQUp3EAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"A congee place that not only gives traditional flavours but also ""out-of-the-box"" flavours like Iberico pork, cheese popcorn chicken, wok hei prawn congee etc. Worth trying out."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpcWVqZGp3RRAB,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"Price is slightly high as considered for porridge,however they are located inside a shopping mall so prices are considered reasonable in this setting, the quality is good and youtiao is crispy. Props for creating dishes suitable for all ages."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzRiemZBEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,2,"nothing special for the price tag, and they charge GST separately. small portion, only 4 small slices of grouper fish for $12.8, and instant coffee for $2.3 is a bit ridiculous."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4cDczSVZBEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,1,"Had very high hopes for their porridge but we were so wrong. The youtiao were chewy and slightly tougher than it should. The intestines weren't freshly fried which was sad coz we were looking forward to it. The chicken leg in my ginseng was really soft  but bland, thought its supposed to be ginseng based. Not coming back."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaTRiQ0dnEAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,4,"I tried this after noticing many older folks patronising this. Had the Tioman fish +century egg + egg porridge. The porridge base was certainly good, and the onsen egg was a nice touch. The fish slices were thick and fresh, but there was a freshwater fish taste to it. If I did not include the add ons, the amount of ingredients in the porridge would have been a bit little. The you tiao was too hard and a bit too chewy and the oil used to fry it was not very fresh. I would eat the porridge again if I’m in the vicinity and have a craving, but $11.30 for a porridge meal is pricey."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aDdEZ2R3EAE,Mun Zuk 满粥,5,"All the porridge we tried were delicious & we could feel the difference in each variety.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbGZUUlRREAE,La Café & Bar,4,"I would give it a 3.5🌟 but Google does not have that option.

Location is really good and so is the ambience nice and cozy.

As per attached pictures from the menu they have wines from France, Italy, Slovakia, Australia, Spain and New Zealand.

The selection for Hard Liquor and Cocktails is not extensive though.

Food seems to be fairly priced and very interesting food from Philippines is on the menu.

Service though was certainly not friendly 👎 and needs loads of improvement. There was 1 staff however who seemed to be friendly.

For those who sit at the huge Barrel (drums) kindly note ⚠️ , they have wheels and may roll  down the slope, you got to be cautious as drinks may spill over in the direction of the slope.

The restaurant seems to have a steady stream of customers.

It's a good idea to check with the restaurant on their food and drinks promo.

Since seating inside the restaurant is limited you may want to call the restaurant in advance and make reservations."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOUpQd2pnRRAB,La Café & Bar,5,"Located at Royal Square ground floor. From outside may not be obvious and gives more of a bar & wine establishment vibe which they do offer, but I'm addition also serve Filipino dishes. They also have options for typical western food like pasta, etc. Milkfish is not common a dish in SG so this would be a good intro to Filipino food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNXFqM29BRRAB,La Café & Bar,1,"Food was generally tasty.
I just wonder why a restaurant will serve beef steak and the beef they serve comes with lots of fats. The chef must be saving the restaurant lots of money by doing so. Ordered some food for new year. Pinoy female Staff was very rude. Horrible service. Female pinoy Staff do not care about customers. Must send them for conmmunication and service course."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX0xEZTVRRRAB,La Café & Bar,1,"Awful experience.

1) standing at the entrance, waiting to be seated. This lady looked at us but ignored us.

2) the other staff (uncle) escorted us in after waiting for 3mins. While seated, I raised my hand for a good 5minutes but nobody came to us. One of us shouted excuse me, order! This staff lady in photo saw and heard us but she just did not care. Most probably she thinks she is only in charge of serving drinks and not taking orders. However, she also does not inform her colleagues to take our order.

I understand that you are understaffed during the peak hour on a Friday dinner. But your service could have been a lot better. This lady really just looked at us and ignored us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd2VHUWx3RRAB,La Café & Bar,4,"Taste is just ok. $14 for a bowl of lomi is overpriced for me, must be because of the generous portion of meat. Think more chicharon and fishballls could be better. But all in all, I still love La Cafe!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNFpmS3B3RRAB,La Café & Bar,3,"The food was not too bad, really loved the dessert!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa2ZXX1NBEAE,La Café & Bar,5,"Good new experience with authentic Filippino food in this cafe/restaurant.

Affordable alcoholand bar food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcS1felpnEAE,La Café & Bar,2,"Sisig is nice. Beer is ice cold and good price.

Just manage your expectation. See menu and actual order. 🙂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ckwtNnh3RRAB,La Café & Bar,3,"It was our first time to visit this restaurant

I like the ambience and location of the restaurant.

Portion and taste of the food is good
Price was comparable to others
Customer service was almost great, just observed that not everyone is happy to serve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NUozMmtBRRAB,La Café & Bar,1,"Got the lunchtime menu items of bangers and mash (sausage slices and mashed potatoes, which was not what the picture showed), sirloin steak and chicken and pork adobo. All 3 items were mediocre at best. Everything was covered in brown sauce. Couldn’t taste anything of the meats at all. The sirloin steak was too tough and a tad dry. Same with the braised chicken and pork adobo. Braised meats should not be tough. The sausage slices just tasted like rubber. I would never be back for the food.

The menu was old and dirty. Pictures were terribly grainy and not representative of the items. The wooden bottom upon which the hot plate for the steak, was broken."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMV9xLXBRRRAB,La Café & Bar,5,"good food, good wine, good environment, good boss but not the Philippino stuff, rude and no common sense to clear the table for us"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDc01qVzd3RRAB,La Café & Bar,5,"Good service, well-priced menu and the best halo-halo ( Filipino dessert, like ice kacang but way better because it has more fresh ingredients ), in Singapore!  Cozy place :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX3FlVmFnEAE,La Café & Bar,4,Alternative place to find Filipino food. Ambiance is good. The food choices are limited but enough to satisfy your cravings for Filipino food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxLUlHNmhnRRAB,La Café & Bar,4,Very good Filipino food overall. Drinks on promo were affordable. I would come back again. I would love to see the service improve though. I hope the owner(s) are taking the steps to improve after seeing the other reviews here regarding the service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMFpfVmJ3EAE,La Café & Bar,1,"Food (mains) here are good. Authentic filipino food. Desserts can be improved. Reason for my 1 star rating though is the service. (1) Experience from dinner some time back: We ordered mains (rice and sinigang) and desserts. The desserts were served first. I told the server that we’re having desserts after our meal. She was unhappy about that and said the desserts cannot be taken back to the kitchen and we should have told her earlier that we’re having the desserts after the meal. Uh okay? Isn’t that the normal sequence of a meal? (2) Experience from lunch today: We ordered 2 dishes with rice and drinks. Drinks, rice and 1 dish were served first. 15 minutes later, noticing that the next table who came after us got the same dish that we were missing, i followed up with the server. She checked with the kitchen and came back to inform us our dish will come after 15-20 minutes. No apologies whatsoever. Just informed us to wait. So to give her context of how long we have been waiting, I told her the table that came after us already got the same dish. At this point, the server blew up and raising her voice told me that if I wanted, she will take the dish from the other table and serve it to us.  Of course I said no. Before I could say anything else, she stalked off. From our table, I could hear her complaining loudly to another staff/ manager. Dish was finally served but the rice and the other dish had gotten cold already at this point. No one (no staff or manager) came to our table to explain or even just to understand what had happened. Originally, I let the first bad experience pass and gave them the benefit of the doubt but after today’s experience, it’s clear (at least to me) that the management need to be made aware of their staffs ‘customer service’."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaC1QT2pRRRAB,La Café & Bar,4,"Pop by for lunch by myself since I am in the area. Staff was polite and patient. Ordered the set lunch of Pomodoro Pasta with chicken skewers. Add on the mushroom soup. Meanwhile my phone battery almost flat, they really tried to find if there's a suitable charger for me. Appreciate that! Soup came and taste good with fragrance of Truffle oil. Could be better if it's thicker. Main course came, pasta is cooked just nice and 3 skewers of tender chicken in teriyaki sauce.
Very relaxing ambience, good service and nice decent food at reasonable price! Will come again, keep up the good work"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dHVmMWpRRRAB,La Café & Bar,5,"Very cozy and pleasant place. Very friendly staff. Special mention to the beautiful and sweet singer from KL  and her guitarist from Manila, kababayan... sorry forgot to get their names."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5a2FhVXlRRRAB,La Café & Bar,3,"No question ask, good Filipino food and value for the money! The owner itself is friendly and took time to greet customers and ask how's the food. However the Filipina waiter doesn't seem to be accommodating, we have to call her how many times and after asking question she will leave right away!! We understand that they are busy but just our 2 cent, they need to pay attention on basic customer service.

PS: All desserts are not available when we visited."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMk0yYUtnEAE,La Café & Bar,5,"Great food at very reasonable prices.
The French Bean is very crunchy.
Has Asia and Western menu and plays contemporary background music. Great join to relax."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdVpUQlNREAE,La Café & Bar,2,"food was good. a little bit pricey.
We pop out for lunch, there were only 2 costumers at that time. and its not busy.
we called out to the filipina (black hair around 40-ish) waitress, and she seemed not very happy abt her work. lol. very impolite and impatient. i asked her to take us a photo before we devour our food lol, but she just waived her hand and walked out. i would’ve understand if the store was busy, but it isn’t. lol
very poor costumer service. smh."

Novena & Newton consider my 2nd home place which I just love my work as salesperson. Wishing everyone to have a dream home at Novena & Newton area. Do engage me if like to know more about Novena & Newton.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJc3FDbDlRRRAB,La Café & Bar,4,At first I though they serve French cuisine by their name but they are actually kind of western & Filipino fusion. Their Filipino food are nice and reasonable pricing but their western and pasta menu are much more expensive though they are also rather good. They have live singing on some days which I don't really enjoy as they are simply too loud for such a small setting.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOExuYURREAE,La Café & Bar,2,"The waitress was polite and the service was fine. The ""chef"" was smoking outside when we arrived and when we left the place.

On a Saturday 11am they were out off burgers ALREADY. Really?
I do not know if they really did not have the meat or if they wanted to make us order something more expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRc1phSXVBRRAB,La Café & Bar,3,"This is a nice cosy place with attentive service.  I had a fish and chips which was not bad at all. The pricing is typical of cafés of this type.

The location is great and it has a nice view of Thomson Road and people walking by.

If you were in the neighbourhood and wanted a meal, this would be a ideal place for a family meal. Recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5N3VIZVRBEAE,La Café & Bar,3,Good value for a pint of beer and good outdoor seating area. However service was slow and seemed like an inconvenience to staff. Could do better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NHRhR3V3RRAB,La Café & Bar,4,"Very good service. Crowd is a mix of posh and pro.
Brunch on a Sunday isn't crowded here and just the right time for chillax after eating. Must try adobo here! 🇵🇭👍😎"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMDZtdDdBRRAB,La Café & Bar,1,I went into the cafe during weekend lunch. Waited 5 mins for someone to direct to be seated then I had to asked the staff who is just solely doing the coffee whether we could sit at the table. Then we sat down for 5 mins look through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat and raised my hand to ask to order and another staff saw my hand so I put down my hand. Then after awhile thinking that the staff would come over to take my order but he disappeared. So after searching for the person and waiting for someone to come and take our orders for 5 mins. We decided to leave. Service is HORRIBLE. Wasted like 15mins.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0aGJ1T3FBRRAB,La Café & Bar,4,"Good, tasty food. Price is reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dHY2V053EAE,La Café & Bar,5,Nice place where you can find Filipino cuisine. Nice retrace for afternoons and evenings

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NXBmZEtBEAE,La Café & Bar,4,Cozy and warm. Staff nice. Price is reasonable. Food is very good. Can recommend to host a lunch or dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcjlXdm13RRAB,La Café & Bar,5,Wonderful Filipinos food. Great service and great selection of wines and liquors.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc29yaXdRRRAB,La Café & Bar,2,The food is quite good but the air is bad. My hair and clothes are smelly which stink me and my bag throughout the the time when I was there and when I am traveling back.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LV9YSWJREAE,Curry Times,5,"Ate there for the first time today. Good food. Wide variety to choose from. Great service.

Decors above the counter remind me of my childhood. The two milo tins and the two pressure lamps.

Will go again to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbGVTWW5BRRAB,Curry Times,5,"Best curry chicken in Singapore.

The menu is so extensive that we had troubles choosing what we wanted! We settled for the classic curry chicken which doesn't disappoint. The portions are very generous. It goes very well with plain white rice, bread and even roti prata.

Overall a very satisfying meal and would come back over and over again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX08zbTF3RRAB,Curry Times,1,"Visited this place on a Friday afternoon around 1 pm. Asked for a table of 5. When we were ushered inside, we had to ownself combine 3 tables to seat ourselves. No menu and order list were given to us. We had to look around for the menu and order list to write down our orders. When food arrived, there was a discrepancy in the food. We ordered the same food but one of the dishes came with missing items. Food was decent. So many fked up things in one meal. Unpleasant dining experience. And the audacity to charge service charge when we literally had to self service ourselves throughout the whole meal. Do not recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHel9lU09nEAE,Curry Times,3,"We had a nice meal at Curry Times at Novena Square last week after our appointment. This is a retro theme cafe with good variety of local food.
The place is spacious and clean with good safe distancing measures in place .
We enjoyed our sapid nasi lemak with chicken wing and curry chicken. The food was appetising and the curry tasted great to our liking. The only disappointment was the very long wait to be served with our food after placing order ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDhuSmx3RRAB,Curry Times,4,"3.5 stars. Ordered the chicken curry with prata and yam paste. The curry was delicious, thick and flavourful. The prata can be crispier. The yam paste was at best average, tasted powdery, not the authentic orh nee."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLUl5VzBRRRAB,Curry Times,3,"This place has seen better times. In the past, they used to serve iced gem biscuits non stop. Now, due to covid, the place is pretty quiet. The food is average now, but the portions are plentiful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzhYSFFBEAE,Curry Times,5,I love Curry Times. Traditional old-school food done well. Pardon the photos of half-eaten food. Too yummy to wait before digging in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeDdXNVRnEAE,Curry Times,4,"Second visit here. Cosy atmosphere with friendly staff. The menu has more dishes now as compared to the past. We had the chicken curry with prata and dry laksa mee goreng. Both cost $8.90 each. The curry was delicious, with the right amount of potatoes and chicken. Wished there were more curry gravy though. The prata could be more crispy. The dry laksa tasted good too, with fish cake, chicken and a few prawns. The noodles would taste even better with a stronger laksa taste. I still prefer laksa with gravy. Would definitely go back for the chicken curry and nasi lemak."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bHBqT2RnEAE,Curry Times,5,"Tried their signature curry chicken rice and it tasted amazing, will come again. I really love their decor and presentation, where tradition meets modernity."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXBienZRRRAB,Curry Times,2,"Photo on menu looks delish. Actual dish plating looks 👌. Disappointed over the small bones in the rice and meat. Cabbage little off taste and black fungus not chewable.

Besides this dish, my colleagues commented that the food standards dropping. I will give my last round soon as I believe F&B needs supports."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbjlPSm93RRAB,Curry Times,3,"Service & Ambience were fine & good.
Food portions were appallingly disappointing. Especially their Signature dish - Fish Head Curry. The size of the fish head doesn't justify for the price of $29.90++.

Curry was lacking in fullness-of-flavour - tasted diluted. Have frequented this place and enjoyed their fish head curry for many years, until today.

Hope something can be done to reinstate the quality on this Signature dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDN3BHYkZ3EAE,Curry Times,4,A place for some home cooked inspire meal. Service is good but a bit slow due to staff strength. Curry beef with prata & chicken rendang nasi lemak taste good. Burbor chacha taste nice but all the sago stuck into 1 lump. Chendol too sweet without taste of coconut milk.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Mm83NGhRRRAB,Curry Times,3,"Loved the old school vibe that the whole place exuded, from the plates and bowls, to what the servers wore, to the interior design.

Food was authentically Singaporean. Enjoyable even if it was nothing in particular to shout about.

Dry laksa hor fun - interesting taste and nice.

Curry chicken - curry seemed a little bland. Maybe needed more coconut milk.

Curry puff - side dish from the lunch set that we took. Old Chang Kee curry puffs never disappoint.

Coffee chendol - I wasn’t crazy about it. Think I’ll stick to a traditional chendol in future.

Clear chicken soup - came with the set too. Yummy. Reminds me of what my grandma made years ago."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNm9xZV93RRAB,Curry Times,5,Our first time experience to try the main. Food is really great and service staff is friendly and attentive. Wide selection of food from snacks to main course. Great for tea break or proper meals.  The place is clean and deco is retro so quite interesting. Peak hours can be packed so do go slightly early before the peak. Their coconut buns and curry buns is a must try too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NU9ISzJ3RRAB,Curry Times,5,I have seen this around for many years and I regret not trying this earlier! We had one Hae Bee 5 Treasures which is huge in portion. Loves the Hae Bee rice balls and the soya chicken. Ordered one curry rice bento which came with lots of chicken (thigh) and curry. Even the potatoes are perfectly cooked and soft! We were so full we can’t finish everything. Will be back!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpZ2JlenR3RRAB,Curry Times,4,"This place was empty compared to Yishun branch. Yishun was pretty packed!

I tried their chicken nasi lemak before on the Yishun branch but here in Novena I tried the otah and hebie bun.

The otah was just okay, I didn't get the fish texture because it's too mushy. The the bun was soft enough but the amount and the taste of hebie compared to the size of the bun made this hebie bun became too salty.

Vote for the best chicken nasi lemak in town!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpM3ZxcmJnEAE,Curry Times,4,Retro theme local food cafe with good variety of curry dishes. Rice is a little dry. Tried coffee chendol but doesn’t blend as well as expected.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGNMSEd3EAE,Curry Times,1,"Service dropped tremendously! Takeaway order was delayed by 20 mins, 1 big sized Chinese female staff named Fangfang and 1 skinny elderly female staff surname Loh frowned and brushed me off instead of apologising for the delay! As if the restaurant never pays them salary, or they thought no end of themselves."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdGZMV01BEAE,Curry Times,4,Great variety on the menu. Decent prices. Awesome curry bun (eat it when it’s hot!) and Dry Laksa.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLV9taHpRRRAB,Curry Times,3,Nice place for local fare though prices are a little on the high end for things like prata. The chicken curry is nice though the chicken taste like frozen chicken - fresh chicken would have taste better.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcmV5TXd3RRAB,Curry Times,4,"This outlet is more spacious than some. Here you can enjoy the signature curry dishes comfortably in the nostalgic decor to resemble Singapore in 1960s. The portion of the curry chicken is pretty huge and delicious. The curry is the thick kind, goes well with bread too. Other dishes I have tried are the curry chap chye, nasi lemak with crispy fried chicken wing and ngo hiang. Stick to the curries, they are good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpN3NESXdnRRAB,Curry Times,4,"Arrived 12.35pm. There were 3 groups in front of us. Nobody seemed to be leaving the restaurant. As we were running out of time to start work at 2pm, we decided to take away. After ordering curry chicken and rice and curry chicken with bread, and one kosong prata, we were told the wait will be approximately 15mins. As we waited, we wondered why it took longer than expected.  Curry chicken and rice are precooked. Why so long? Maybe short of manpower.
The curry was good. The chicken were generous in portions. We were not disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNbDVmeTVnRRAB,Curry Times,4,"Ordered the salmon otah n their signature curry bun and it was pretty good. I like the fact they warm up the food so that it can enhance the taste. Best part is between 2.30-5pm, any bun or coffee/tea is only $2.50. Worth to pay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNneXNDNjJRRRAB,Curry Times,4,"Nice ambience & cosy place for a quick bite. The curry bun is to die for. So fluffy & moist. One is not enough. Breakfast set is cheap & good. Serves traditional all time fav such as roti prata, mee curry etc. Price is reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZb3RUazdBRRAB,Curry Times,4,"Jan 2020
Came back to try different dishes.  My wife had the curry chicken with prata and enjoyed it. I ordered the rendang chicken nasi lemak.  The chicken was okay, but the rice was lumpy.

The grass jelly drink was a little weird tasting in that the jelly tasted a little off, but the coffee and iced lemon tea were okay.

Service was efficient.

July 2019
Pretty decent food and decor, and nice place to grab a tea or coffee. Love the buns, especially the coconut and curry ones."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHV1UC1RRRAB,Curry Times,3,"Tried the mint chicken, onion omelette, curry chap chye and the $2.50 set which came with a hot drink and roti prata.

The mint chicken curry was full-bodied and the meat was tender; I would recommend you try this if you are looking for something non-spicy. The onion omelette was a generous portion and tasted like how you would expect an onion omelette to taste. On the other hand, the curry chap chye was a let down, being too watery and just not lemak enough.

The roti prata was crispy but tasted like it could have come from a frozen pack, it was served with curry which was pretty good. For $2.50 with a hot drink, I might return and have it again as a breakfast or afternoon snack."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjcyb2t3RRAB,Curry Times,4,Nice food at very reasonable price! No wonder it's often very crowded during lunch hour.  The curry chicken is a must try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdkxuUGdBRRAB,Curry Times,4,My 4th time here and I ALWAYS order the fish maw soup. Usually busy so customer service might take awhile but the staffs are friendly and nice. Good for an old school taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbnMzclFBEAE,Curry Times,4,"Now they have a wide spread of food. Still love their curry bun and the heh-bee-Hiam bun. If you patronize in the morning, Bun with drink is only $2.50nett. We ordered multiple dishes for late morning and the chap chye given was disappointing, just a one person's portion. Sambal petai was good though. Well i must say that's acquired taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMUxPQ0hREAE,Curry Times,3,"First time here, Ordered their signature curry chicken and I would have preferred if their curry was slightly more spicy. My friend and I dropped by at 6:30 and the curry served was lukewarm at best so that could be why it didn't taste as good but I would definitely revisit to try more of their other dishes!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMF8tcVpBEAE,Curry Times,4,"Quite a hidden restaurant in the mall. Overall the food was good, especially the curry. Not too spicy and eat with bread or rice. The otak otak is different shape than I expected. Haha. Will visit again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMnF6enV3RRAB,Curry Times,3,Popular lunch place so there’s usually a queue. But you can get a table quickly if it’s just 1 or 2 pax. Ordered the daily special tomato chicken noodle and was told that there’s only the dry version (though the menu shows it with soup). Found it ok only. Star dish was the cold tofu (which my friend recommended) - nice mix of tangy and savoury flavours
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnb2ZDSktnEAE,Curry Times,3,"Food is not bad, quite nice actually. But for the price, portions are quite small.
Food came within 5 minutes of ordering.
Free cookies!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eUtHaFpREAE,Curry Times,4,"The curry is very tasty, and healthy (no coconut milk!). The dry laksa is tasty and fragrant. The salmon otak is unique and good quality. Chicken curry hor fun is very well made too, with a lot of ingredients - fish cake, chicken, tau pok, tau gay, hard boiled egg, okra...
Was also pleasantly surprised that their hot chrysanthemum tea is brewed with real chrysanthemum and served in quite a large mug, and not too sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNa2Z2RzBBRRAB,Curry Times,5,"Great food and prices, great and fast services, have vegetarian choices, all curry and chilli tastes great"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z29yaXNRRRAB,Curry Times,5,"Wow. Amazing curry, soft potatoes, nice sesame filling ball, and fluffy prata. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc3RmWEVBEAE,Curry Times,2,"While we enjoy the food, the establishment hasn't moved ahead along with the Government's reviewed measures that customers do not need to rescan the silly 'safe entry' when it's already been done at the shopping mall's main entrances. Please keep up with times and do away with this silly hassle."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyLTRUQnlRRRAB,Curry Times,3,Used to be awesome before Covid but many great dishes vanished and now it’s still good food but with a less nice selection and unless you are close by no longer worth the trip
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMU0yYW5nRRAB,Curry Times,4,"Honest to goodness local fare. Always enjoy
Their traditional curry chicken with a slice of roti prata.  Other faves of mine include the dry laksa. And of cos, while waiting for your mains to be served, why not get an Old Chang Kee curry puff?

#cafe #cafesg #localfood #localfoodsg #rotiprata #chickencurry #oldchangkee #jedidiahtan"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdHBlX2l3RRAB,Curry Times,3,"Stopped by at Curry Times operated by the Old Chang Kee Group. Was looking forward to a curry bun filled with aromatic, rich and tangy curry that made their puffs so popular in the early 1970s. The bun was a soft and sweet but the small dollop of potato, chicken and curry mixture wasn't much to go around. It tasted like the result of mechanization. Still an amicable afternoon tea snack if you wash it down with the ""kopi""."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNTllQlRnEAE,Curry Times,4,Service has always been friendly and personal. Curry chicken is worth going for on a damp weekday evening .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaU5fSHZ3RRAB,Curry Times,1,The food comes out really slow. Several tables who ordered after us got their food really quickly even though we ordered the same thing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMUxQcnZ3RRAB,Curry Times,5,Tried the signature curry chicken with bread. Yummy.. the lemongrass drink is too sweet though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMDhEV0tREAE,Curry Times,5,Delightful décor and scrumptious meals. Quick service. Robot waiter available with trays.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdWNxSFZREAE,Curry Times,4,"Good food with a little home taste. Try the braised beef $15.90 sharing portion. Haybee hiam bun $1.50 is excellent. Generous filling. Note this is halal restaurant. Strictly no ""outside"" food allowed. You may not eat your own birthday cake there.

Understandable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHemRMM3FRRRAB,Curry Times,1,"Brought my 3 year old and 1 year old to your Novena Square outlet last night. As they are extremely fussy eaters we brought food we knew they would eat but we were told “no outside food allowed”. Your waitress had just served 2 plates of rice for them whilst I was preparing to order dinner for my wife and I then she noticed the food we brought for our kids, proceeded to reject my explanation that it was for our fussy eating kids, and promptly removed the kid’s rice from the table. It was 7pm prime dinner time but you only had 2 other occupied tables of customers in the whole restaurant yet your waitress still saw fit to prevent our kids from eating knowing this would cause us to leave because she can’t even make a no outside food policy exception for a toddler and an infant. Way to go Curry Times, way to go. So much for touting yourselves as a “kids friendly” family restaurant. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd0t5RGh3RRAB,Curry Times,4,"Ordered one Roti Prata Kosong  and other with egg.  The curry is nice and tasty.  Hot soya milk not so sweet but has tinges of soya favour after taste.
For rice or noodle, ranged from SGD 8.00-SGD10. 00. A bit on the high side. Reasonable for a weekend treat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcnRuWVJ3EAE,Curry Times,5,Always love the chicken wings. Home cook taste 👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdWVtcGZ3EAE,Curry Times,4,Ambience good. Quite quiet. Warning for sinfully oily flavorful food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOTRmNkJREAE,Curry Times,3,Slightly overpriced for what it is... we had chicken curry mee siam which wasn’t bad but the portion was miserable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRem9xWUtREAE,Mila-Salleh Malay Food,4,Great tasting food at affordable prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdnNtcGRREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,If you looking for Lok Lok taste Same like JB then you must try this restaurant… especially the oil fried mushrooms … and their Satay sauce is the best to eat with anything …
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZa3VHVG5RRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Comfort Food ! Love the simplicity both of the restaurant and the food. Quality is good and clean. Occasionally Chef will serve you satay and chicken wings and some happening pork strips all deep fried ! Yummy! Buffet served at $25-26 per pax, comes with free flow drinks, ice cream, coffee and also crackers! You can choose your items and just let it boil or put a white peg on the plate to note that you want them deep fried . Look for Kelly who manages e restaurant there. Totally cheerful and nice. Wish there were more outlets like these. Pure and simple everytime !"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cXJ1WVdREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Talk about good value for money, this place is definitely it! All you can eat and drink on loklok, steam boat and grill. The staff are super nice and attentive. You can order using the paper sheets and also they'll come around with any newly cooked dishes. The satay is really good and the alecarte are worth a try as well!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNE9HbXB3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Foods so so only but still ok
Service not so good also. Will recommend go and try but might not be go next time. End up didn't expect price $33+ per person"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcU5qMlhREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Most people there are having Malacca Lok Lok/steam boat. I went there specifically for the Hokkien mee and prawn mee. Prawn mee stock was really rich, unlike most places. It’s an aircon coffee shop with friendly staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpa0xqdEt3EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Borders close but you can consider dropping by this place for some Malaysia Lok Lok! I feel it’s quite authentic. They offer fried and steamed Lok Lok dishes. Thumbs up for their fried Lok Lok dishes, it was delicious.

Crowded but the staffs were still very attentive to every request of customers. Lots and lots of selection, the prawns were really huge, and it’s peeled! Favorite items included fried crab stick, sliced abalone, luncheon meat, enoki mushroom, cheese tofu and satay! Occasionally, the staffs will also go around serving fried items like seaweed chicken, satay, nuggets, chicken wings, fried tofu skin and etc.

Very satisfied after eating and 3 of us in total drank 9 cups of drinks!! For the buffet, it includes free flow of drinks, from hot beverages to canned drink, and even home made drinks like ice lemon tea and lime juice.

Note: Buffet is for 2 hours! Ice cream is also served at the end. 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTNktpbTZ3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"Bad service.. they're trying to control your food intake knowing that it's a buffet hotpot.
Reason from them: no pending orders,  but paper was handed over to the staff.

Tips:
Sit inside if you want good service, bad service, sit outside..
They're passing around some satays etc.. if  you are inside..
Ask for the ice cream and fruits, it's free flow but they won't tell you and didn't inform us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMXZYWGxnRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Feels like I've crossed the border! 😆
Malaysian feel interior and lok lok skewers with selected soup base or satay sauce.
Choice of buffet at $28+ /adult or ala  carte with 80cents per stick for basic meats and veg,which are pathetically small in portion! Eg one slice of meat on one skewer, two pieces broccoli on one skewer.. There's also premium zhi char dishes which cost more, and BBQ marinated food for you to BBQ next to the lok lok.
Refreshing idea for a meal,but slightly pricey to have a full meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMmFqUDNnRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Food is good, and has a lot of variety to choose from, you can also pick the Lok Lok you want and ask the staff to fry for you. The staff are nice too. And they have this chicken satay it's very very nice will recommend. The bad thing is about the clip that you clip on for the fried Lok Lok is a bit dirty... Overall good place to eat. And they have a 20% discount when you like and share the page and one of their post"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVejRIOHNnRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,2,"Leaves a lot to be desired.. the white beehoon was the biggest let down, no taste at all... I guess if you came for the Lok Lok only it’s passable but not for the other things on the menu.. Whole family stomach feeling weird now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta2VMVE9REAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,Love this place for lok lok. Great soup bases. Value for money given 3 different ways of cooking
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa08tVGFBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Great service. Lady waitress/boss very good in recommending and sharing on what’s available and how to cook.

Although 2 hours time limit they are flexible.  Anyway an hour plus we are all done.

Love their satay and satay sauce. Fried chicken wings taste good as well although everyone goes for Lok Lok. Their herbal soup tastes good. All came out with full stomach and no food wastage.  Free flow ice cream (my youngest ones love it) and soft drinks.

Will return to check out other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNlBERkxnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,The satays are nice. The fried items are surprisingly not oily. The lok lok sticks are great. The soup based are refreshing. And the service is awesome.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3JUZlNnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,1,$24 bucks for chicken rice for 2.  Chicken is stone cold and still bloody.  Rice is dry and hard. Cashless now so inconvenient have to pay thru the app where they capture your info and then annoy you with marketing.  What a disaster RWS has become.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MDhMN093EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"10/10. Staffs friendly and accommodating. Will come back for the angry bird again.

30 June 2022 : back here again after 2 years with my family + master chef and sad to hear no more angry bird. but food is still awesome. Lady boss still very friendly and shop hygiene upgraded alot. Cheese tofu is now my new favorite thank you. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMGNtLUpREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"The food here is OK. You can have them fried the item you want or cook it yourself in the soup of your choice. If you plan to eat a lot, you can go for unlimited stick and it comes with drink and ice  cream"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z3JEX053EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Food was decent,  variety ok. Prices subjected to 10% svc charge but quite reasonable. We told the person is our first time, and they patiently explained the menu items and how to order. Also came by to check if we needed soup refill. Would love to come by indulge once in a while. Also quite nice on. Weekday is not crowded and they did not rush us to leave after eating."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBOUxLak53EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"The name is 'Lok Lok' which diners dip food skewered with sticks in melting pot to cook, the variety can be better. But price and dessert variety is alright."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdnZXYkNREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Since we can't go Malaysia, chance upon this lok lok place. They open late! So for all the supper eaters like us!! Do order the satay sauce when you are there! Friendly lady boss. We choose ala cart as we didn't felt we could eat alot.

Do go for the buffet if you're a big eater, much more worth it !:)

We had the chicken soup and peanut sauce. We also love the bbq option. Must better than the other coffee shops fried greasy options (ps they do have option of fried as well).

Will definitely return back with friends once dining restriction ease!!:)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X0w3RFdnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Great place and atmosphere!!! Price is definitely worth it, food is awesome, fresh and hot and the staff and boss are super friendly. Very proactively served us the fried food, ice cream, fruits and just a very good experience that I would highly highly recommend to everyone!!! Super duper worth it so must come and visit!! Good price, good food, good people."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeFpQaFhBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"Avoid at all costs.

Service: absolutely terrible, especially the lady boss (tall). Gave attitude and black faced to first timers who was unfamiliar with the ordering system. Charge 10% service charge for lousy service.
Food: mediocre. Penang hokkien mee was soggy. Lok lok variety limited and unfresh. Ala carte 0.80 for one single beef ball.
Soup base: More like salted flavored water. Mala soup base was diluted++.

The only saving grace is probably the airconditioned environment.

Seriously, there are better lok lok places to dine at."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeWY2aVFBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"First time going to buffet shop, what u order u won't get it. First ask the waitress y we order so much and come out only this few they told us still preparing please wait as the shop had a lot of customer. After eating n waiting for one hour plus we saw quite a lot had left or sitting down chit chat so we decided to order one last round before settings the bill. We felt very disappointed what we order not even half of it come and the staff already cleaning or prepare to close shop kind of attitude. So what I think if u worry people eat a lot please don come out do buffet"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dXJyNXJ3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,2,"If you’re used to satay celup in Malacca and the lok lok vans in Malaysia, then the food here isn’t going to quite hit the mark unfortunately. The next best thing until the borders open... but not the best thing. Also opted for the buffet on a weeknight and the total bill came up to about $66 which didn’t feel worth it overall."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4azRlUXl3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Went for the lok lok buffet, there were a large variety to choose from. Service was excellent as well! Will definitely visit them again!

For Satay peanut sauce +$6 for the table."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMUlhZjRRRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"1 particular staff gave really bad service. Saw a few tables of customers were uncomfortable with the services too.

Advise first timers to read the comments before heading down, to get a sense of the type of service you will be getting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb1BlYTlBRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,2,Many items and soup base to choose from. Paid about $32nett a pax for buffet on weekday. Service was good but can’t say much about the taste of the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNXB2RkdnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"My favorite lok lok buffet place! It's $26.80 on weekends/public holidays and has a wide variety of items to choose from. Some items like prawns may not be the freshest but I'm not complaining because I feel overall it's worth it for the price! Many condiments to choose from to create your own dipping sauce, and drinks and ice cream also included! Can choose two soup bases and the Tom yum is my number one fav!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaEstTHB3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,4,Lady boss is friendly and staff is helpful. Food had variety and its good for family gathering. With 5kiddos that quick picky eater is surprisingly a good place for mummy enjoy food and kids can do their own food eating and services.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpd3Mya25nRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,3,The satay sauce is nice. Variety available is not really attractive. Dont go for sell BBQ. The stall and do for you. It's much better. 😊
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZ0k3cXZBRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Love their Lok Lok buffet! I always ordered their satay sauce (+$6) as it's very thick and hot, suitable for dipping your lok lok in. The lady boss there is very nice and friendly, don't be surprise if she recommend you on how to eat :)

The staffs are nice too! One of them who just fried the nuggets and chicken wings (SERIOUSLY crispy and tasty) went to every desk to offer them to the customers. I took some of course."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpcE9QamtnRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"Service is extremely bad especially the ladyboss. Totally different with Melaka structure. Menu is very confusing, the segregation of buffet and ala Carte not writing clearly. No next visit anymore!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeklfSVlREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,Wide variety of food! Comes with drinks too.. love their satay!! The BBQ meat portion comes in pretty big portion so careful when ordering..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdGNINnh3RRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"I'm always wary about restaurants or food outlets that claim to be Ipoh or Penang or Malaysian. This again proved to be the case. Food was mediocre at best. Takes a long time for the food to arrive. AC is insufficient for a lok-lok place. Also, lady boss talks too much unnecessarily. Will not be returning or recommending."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMTczSlNREAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,Affordable and nice. They fry your lok lok too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbWEzT2NBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,Worth the money to go for a buffet! Owner was very nice and attentive to constantly check on us and topped up our soup without asking. She even gave us satay! Chill and pleasant to eat 😀
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLel9Db2lBRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Can’t go Malaysia now, at least can come here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVanItdGtnRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,5,Value for money. Its an affordable unique buffet very neat way of eating using the malaysia style of lok lok. They will help you fried your food as well as steam boat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZamZtU2ZBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Very nice place, clean and bright. The lady boss was very kind and thoughtful. Kept checking on us throughout the nite. Food was decent and will solve your cravings for Malaysian food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZbk4tVVF3EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,1,"Had supper with my gfs and towards the end of the dinner, we discovered an lizard-like animal in one of our soup bases. We immediately took photos before she tried to clear the evidence away. When asked, the employee serving us insisted its perfectly fine to drink the soup and then suggested to give FOC us the soup base. We were flabbergasted to hear that because we were not expecting a free meal or discount but an explanation from the lady boss. When we pressed the employee to ask her lady boss to come forward to speak to us, the lady boss refused. The poor employee went back and forth to speak to her boss. Eventually, the poor employee came back for the last time and told us the the meal will be free. We insisted to pay for the meal but we want to see the boss. After hanging around for 5mins, we left because the employee cleared the plates. The lady boss is still nowhere in sight. Never coming back here again. First time and last time. NEA should check on their food hygiene!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaU95eEhnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Although it is not fully air conditioning, it is comfortable eating there. The staffs are friendly n helpful. They will personally served you fried food that just came out from the kitchen."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwenBDYUVnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Lok lok varieties and selections not much and prices a bit on the high side for ala cart menu.. For those who loves lok lok and big eater.. buffet is more suitable..
Ambience wise normal.. location not bad with other good eateries around.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdDlERmJBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,5,"Didn't manage to reserve a booking.
Took awhile to get seated on a Friday night.
Be it cooked food or fresh food, all are great!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnazVYbkVnEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Lok lok that is more hygienic than the ones you find in Malaysia cause you get a brand new pot of lok lok base to dip your food into.

Decent selection and a good place to go if you're craving for lok lok. They charge by a bundle of 100 pieces or you can go for the buffet option where you get free flow of drinks and ice cream too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBd3Z5LWRBEAE,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Pastries are nice, but most things here are a bit more pricey than they're worth, in my opinion.

I'd add this to my list of places in Katong you should try, but not necessarily one you'd want to frequent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDZzlQNWJ3EAE,Malaysia Local Delights,3,"Very good service. The quality of the Lok Lok is just ok. Would recommend the satay, satay sauce and thai fish cake."

Beef bourguignon melts in your mouth. Do take home a loaf of bread to enjoy at home. :)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbjVMcm5BRRAB,Malaysia Local Delights,4,"Good loklok buffet, best for groups. Taste of Malaysia while we are stuck in Singapore"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOE1DVWVREAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,Ok to satisfy your Malaysian hawker food cravings without going over the causeway you could count on fei xiong group.  This is one of their branches that's compact enough to squeeze in multiple stores. Price point is very reasonable in Singapore context. Food quality is passable. One of those no frill tummy fill eatery. Coffee and tea is surprisingly cheap. If you are in City Square and want some hawker style food. You may give this place a try .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWNlZjJBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Let's be fair and honest, the food quality has dropped due to the inflation and the spike rised of food cost, I can accept it, the most is visit lesser since there are other alternative around the corner, that's not my main focus today.

Something I want to highlight and cannot tolerate with, is the attitude of the staff at city square mall. I am a regular customer of Fei Xiong Group.
I always patrol their stalls at different places all over Singapore, specially Encik Tan at Vivo, Malaysia Boleh at AMK Hub and Jurong Point, Nam Kee Pao at Grandstand and Plaza Singapura and Malaysia Chiak at  Centre point, all the staff I have met never show any attitude problems so far except the branch at City Square Mall.

I have had encountered a few incidents prior to my sharing today. It was a very unpleasant experience and affected my lunching mood each time.

The staff I would like to bring to the attention is the staff in charge of Claypot rice/Bak Kut Teh, this man is always very rude and impatient while serving customers.

The other one is the staff preparing the wantoon noodle and ban mian, skinny male Malaysian who simply ignored my special order and showing sign of attitude.

This was what had happened, I discovered that I was paying $0.90 for my takeaway, hence clarified why not $0.60. after knowing that charged per container, I decided not to separate my noodle from the soup. He was a bit unhappy but refunded the $0.30. What made me feeling frustrated was my curry noodle was ready,  but he told me the ban mian wouldn't be ready so fast but have to wait, fine🙄.

So I stood aside, while waiting, I only saw one customer collected the wanton noodle, no one else. Next one was my turn, question is, why would he wants to delay my ban mian? Why can't he prepare both at the same time?

The worse thing is, after I reached home, I saw that the curry has nearly dried up due to the delay on the waiting time and I also didn't get the breast meat I specially ordered which he promised to serve, instead I got a chicken wing with 2 tao pok and two tiny pieces of long bean, which I really dislike chicken wings. Ended up I added luncheon meat to go with the beehoon.

I had the feeling that this staff did a ""revenge"" behind the scene to his customer after being requested a $0.30 refund and causing some trouble to him. Obviously this is an attitude problem!!!

The above scenario was only one out of the so many incidents I had encountered and why should I not sharing this with all of you so that I am not the only one but you can also try to experience it yourself. Good Luck!!

这槽真的不吐不快！City Square Malaysia Chiak的员工，特别是肉骨茶和云吞面/板面摊位的，实在没有职业操守，不懂得尊重自己的职业和身份，态度恶劣也嚣张，这种的态度，这种的员工，放在什么地方都不受欢迎，记住你的脸了，看见有你的脸出现的餐饮，绝对不会光顾的。 好的要分享，坏的也要说说，你们也可以好好的去感受感受, 祝你好运！！"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOXRxTFp3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"Had the kuey teow, chendol, and popiah.
Forgot to take the photo of the kuey teow.

The chendol was pretty authentic tasting. Similar to the one i had in penang. However, the ingredients are found to be lacking in quantity. The green jello and the red beans were very much missing and only had a very small quantity.

The char kuey teow was not bad. Except it was missing a key ingredient namely the lap cheong. Chinese sausage. Other than that, 70% alike.

The popiah was decent. Not fantastic but okay.

Not sure why we have to keep our own plates here since it's more a restaurant than a hawker centre."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM18zZmNBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,"Char Kuey Teow was decent. They did not allow me to make any changes like “no chilli”. Wanton Mee was a little too sweet, but it did hit the spot. Ban mian was good, but also sweet. Chendol not quite worth the calories. May return if crave for Malaysian food again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc3FLb2hnRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,2,"Update 27/9/2021 - The food standard has dropped a lot. Not sure what happened, did they change recipe or changed owners? The claypot rice, claypot sesame chicken and claypot klang BKT tastes totally different from 4 months ago.

Great tasting food but some of the staff here are seriously rude to another level. Foods here taste somewhat like Malaysia and the prices and portions are very reasonable.

Three stars because of the staff’s attitude. Very conveniently located near the Farrer Park MRT (Purple Line). One can expect to spend less than $20 for 3 claypot dishes and 2 drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMlp2cVRREAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"If I could rate this zero stars which is the rightful rating.
I should have read all the bad reviews before coming here.

Super bad attitude n bad horrible expensive food.  Paid $8/-for 3pcs of punny pork bones. The Bak Kut Teh stall guy..treated me like i owe iit to him to accept my order. And he wanted additional $$ fot soup refill.
To all tourist and locals,  my advice is NEVER PATRONISE THIS PLACE."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHBQZkV3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"I had the Wanton Mee and Chendol, the chendol was acceptable, don't think they used gula melaka. The wanton mee was bad, mainly due to the soup, like they kept around for too many days. The pork looked beautiful, but tasted bad also. Don't order the wanton mee. The staff was also rude, but that seemed to be keeping with the quality of the place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ01LbnBBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,5,"Was initially here just for the dried ban mian. However, the chicken rice does seems to look appetising so gave it a try as well.
The chicken rice is average, but the ban mian is still pretty good and packed with flavour.
Did not try foods from other stalls as the portion seemed to be a little small.
Overall, the place is a little small so it is difficult to find seats but the ban mian is definitely worth a try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHN2NHS3JBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"First and last time that I'm paying money for such food, terrible attitude and service.

Ordered through Grab for self-pick up. Noticed a couple of my items missing but there was no staff to clarify.

Very hard to get the attention of any of the staff. Finally managed to get the attention of the staff manning the claypots, he rudely told me that all the food was packed and I should check.

I had to raise my voice and tell him that my items were missing. He yelled for another staff before he found my missing items.

If this was a grab delivery, my order will definitely have missing items.

Foodwise, curry chicken noodles had a lot of oil. Counted at least 10 tablespoons. (Gave up after a while)
Chicken rice, char siew rice, ban mian, claypot rice all so-so. Nothing stood out"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ2NqNllnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"The self-claimed traditional Klang Bak Kut Teh cost $6 n it's served by a mini pot which is already quite small n the soup is not only half filled but come with 3 pieces ""thumb size"" of pork, 3 sliced of canned mushrooms n countable bean curd skins.. I'm wondering what's filled in the management mind with such a disappointing biz concept on their dishes, half filled also? First n last visit for me 🙏🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX1oyUUdnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Came here just for the not so 'Malaysia' Malaysian food, but the claypot staff is freaking rude. I even wondered if I owe him money? or probably his boss nvr give salary?😂
if you see this comment, pls don't come."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLczlpazFBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,2,"This is my second visit and decided to try this po pian, it is very pricey at 2.50$ and is definitely one of the top price in town. However, although the presentation looks decent, but the filling looks not packed unlike most of other, the filling is always fully packed. Also, the main ingredient, turnip are not well cooked and tasted quite bland and dry. Nothing much has put in the filling to justify the price. Definitely will not try again as you easily get a better one anywhere else. Also, the stall holder don’t even bother to ask if you need to add chilli which is usually asked by all others to avoid any misunderstanding.
Today revisited this outlet and tried the curry chicken noodle. Curry is tasty and chicken is tender. And it comes with several stalk of long bean which are uncooked. Not sure if it meant for human or otherwise.
Generally, while food wise is mostly reasonable but attitudes of the staff taking order is generally rude or at least unfriendly.
Just for those who wish to try to fried kway tew, do not that the stall only serve with chilli and if you want non spicy version, then too bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdm95WHF3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"The food standard has dropped a lot like a totally different recipe. I doubt if they change owner or the staff is new. If I were to give rating, last time was 9/10 now is 1/10. Taste like they just simply stir the panmee with plain soya sauce. Not worth the price paid.

Staff are rude and have attitude problems. Not customers-oriented."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcFl2YmFnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Extremely rude & unpleasant staff. The plump woman manning the drink stall shouts at customers. The younger lady running the wanton mee stall is very rude too. Very impatient & frequently snaps at customers.
I wonder if the boss did not pay them salary on time? The staff there will simply spoil your day. Will never ever return again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOXZiUVh3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"Decent prices n good local food.
Staff are rude n impatient however can get on after payment n dig into your meal right after. Ample seats around a break from shopping."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTX1pHdTVnRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"Nice place to have some hawker fares. The wanton Mee is pretty average, the current chicken noodles is good0,, chicken rice is good. Chendol is great too. Good clean tables and the cleaner is quite efficient too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcUlLR19RRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"Have their claypot chicken rice. Overall is at the standard (ie presentation, taste-wise etc) but I would still prefer those heated using charcoal. Anyway, it’s a good to-go option if u miss eating the claypot rice!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NTZPUFp3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,Staffs attitude is very bad and rude! I think she need to send back for training and Management need to teach her how to behave and respect to the customer. One of the Chinese girl who work on Chicken rice stall on 8/8/2022 at 4.20pm.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2E2NmNBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Been here few times, but this is worst experience.  The bkt is pricey, but the taste is horrible. The soup is little,  the meat was cooked too long. In fact,  it tasted like overnight left over. Last time to this branch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMklDT1l3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Miserable portion of chicken in chicken rice filled with bones. Tasted  horrible, totally not worth $7.50

Am not surprised at all with the negative reviews.. Visit at your own risk."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OW9xOG1RRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,2,"Wouldn’t mind with attitude, yet 7 SGD for only TINY portion of meat in Bak Kut Teh, and there’s barely meat but fat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwOS1yLTB3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"A refreshing addition to the City Square Mall food options.

Wanton Mee: noodle is springy. Sauce was good. Wanton is so so. Soup is bland.

Curry Mee: Soup gravy is good. Noodle is nice. But overall, lacks the punch.

Overall: Recommended to go and try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLVlhTzdRRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,Cheap no frills favourites from Malaysia. Claypot rice has got the burnt rice bits but missing out on the salted fish.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bThqd1NREAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,5,"Started patronising due to good deals available on shopee. Tried the char kway teow and love it. Popiah is huge, very worthwhile if using shopee voucher bought at promo price, else taste wise is just ok, nothing to rave about. Haven't tried other food but the curry noodle definitely smell good, will try next. Staff are not with the best attitude but also not as bad as how some have described. At least I didn't encounter. About 5 visits made."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydHJ2R1ZBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,Went there on 18Apr 7pm. Penang Char Kuay Teow were dry and light in colour and not dark. Not much taste . Price not worth to pay for as little items in the Char Kuay Teow. Not really authentic as claim from Penang.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMGZTVXRBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,"This is just at the entrance when you exit from Farrer Park MRT into the mall. Was quite surprised that there is a food court here. Definitely a strong competitor to Food Republic at the top floor. I think this is similar to Yishun North Point. The Bak Kut Teh tastes similar. Only 2 pork ribs & a few slices of meat. The saving grace is the sambal belacan. It really got kick. Chendol ($2) is less generous than the one I had in North Point.
Sitting capacity is small. Might have trouble finding seats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd2R2RXdnRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,Worst attitute the staffs over here. All staffs should have name tags so will be easier to name them out on their lousy attitute. Please put a nametag on each staffs for easier complaint.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNaU5TYXBBRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Claypot chicken rice taste is average, very few pcs of chicken for the amount of rice. Bak kut teh pork is tough and only 3 small pcs with 3 thin slices of fatty pork. Soup has an unpleasant, overpowering medicinal taste of some particular herb. Chendol portion is small with few red beans but quite good coconut taste though somewhat lacking gula melaka. Overall don't bother unless you want to feel angry."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dXNMSFJBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Really bad attitude from the wanton char siew stall server. A customer was in front of me, behind me there were tables and chairs...also have to keep a distance from the person in front...instead of asking me nicely, she gave me a blackened face and said:' why can't you stand here and pay here!'
I was still right in front of the stall and was only towards the right side.... I could not hear her when she asked for my order as she was preparing noodle and asking with her head faced down. There and then it started this bad attitude.
Perhaps the server might be feeling down that day but please never direct this to the customer. Food is mediocre and service attitude was so bad. Will not return again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbVBENzl3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,"For lack of economical choice, this place fits the bill. Food is OK but not superb."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURheHRELTlRRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"I liked Malaysia food very much. Been supporting these outlets since it opened. However. I realized the standard of food dropped. The taste deteriorate. Eventhough after I suggested to the black shirt manager. The food did not improve. It came to the point that I finally made up my mind. Not to patronise the food stall anymore. Reasons being :
1) pricey. And portion is disappointing. Eat but cannot fill the stomach even with the large portion bought.
2) food is served with few or little tiny portions of meat and prawns or just 2 prawns. Few bean sprouts and few scattered eggs only for char kway teow or prawn noodle.
3) charged for every single box when asked to separate mee from soup for takeaway. When you did not make plastic bag availabkw for packing the noodles.
4) less than desirable attitude of the staff. That when you stand in queue in front of the cash register. They tend to ignore you and do their own cooking and delivery orders instead of politely asking you to hold on a while. This happened when I was at singpost at 1030an. Non peak hours.

In view of the above. My decision is not to patronise these stall any time in the near future. As for the price and portion. I have better options to fill my stomach somewhere else.

Thank you for scrimping on the portions thereby maximising your profits during this period.
Good luck for your business."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c04zTUxnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,5,"Helpful staff, friendly service, decent prices for portion size. Food is certainly not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcE9mSVBREAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,The management should really look into the serving and attitude of staff. So pricey to pay $7 for this!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN2M3Q0ZnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"DO NOT BUY THEIR BAH KUT TEH. I just had one here, $7 with rice. There isn’t much meat, mostly bones and mushroom. This should be regarded as a scam for $7. Never coming back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aWVDR3RnRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,Staffs attitude is very very bad ! I think she need to send back for training! Hope the management can take action for this branch ! This not 1 or 2 times like this services !!!!!!!!!!! Bad !!!!!!!!! Not recommended coming !!!!!!!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bV9fSHJRRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"1) it was chaotic for customers to queue to order the various cuisines. It is frustrating for customer to know that he has to re queue for the food in another line in the middle for something that was advertised in the first stall. There was absolutely no signage to say which queue for which cuisine ?

2) Staff tells customers off very rudely when it is obviously not the customers’ fault but the poor signages for not indicating the correct queue for different cuisine.

3) if nothing is done to improve the system and the unacceptable service, it is unlikely for anyone to support this stall"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMnJMOWN3EAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"This place should have a 0 star rating. All staff who take order and cook have bad attitude in accepting your order.
Worse is the wanton noodles counter. Saw the lady rinsing her fingers into the pot for cooling the noodles twice. Very unhygienic.
This place does not accept cashless payment. Whatever cash that she handled went into the water for cooling the noodles."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NktPcmlRRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"I always have a soft spot for Malaysian food BUT this is by far the WORSE dining experience for me! Very lousy staff attitude (like u owe them a living!) and naturally you will never get good food with a lousy cook! I've never post anything in social media but this lousy experience prompted me to warn others about this! If the boss even care enough about their business, they shd either train the staff or fire them all. Or maybe the boss is the problem, abused the staff and make them so unhappy. Whatever the cause, if you are looking for THE WORSE FOOD and THE WORSE ATTITUDE, u can definitely experience them here in the fullest form! I feel so disapointed with these unfortunate attitude when my memory of food providers in Malaysia are mostly warm and provide very good food! NOT HERE! have some pride please! Siakswei!🙄😒"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNXZiYXZ3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"the quality of customer service is totally out ,food nice the almost like malaysia ,but the price and quantity in the portion  are very little i bought kuay teow goreng for 6.80$ the contain look alike 4.50$, arrogant staff quality of serving is out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeUthRmRnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,2,"The highlight of my visit to “malaysia chiak” is always the char kway teow.

Sprinkled with bean sprouts it was a delight and my greed would show whenever  I left my plate completely clean.

But not this time.

It has turned soggy and I left half uneaten.

I won’t be returning unless standards improve.

A plate is now $5 up from $4:50."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMDduS3N3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,"Decent claypot chicken rice, not much to rave abt. Purchased coupon from shopee at $4.30 as the original price is at $5. Waiting time at least 10 minutes or so during peak hour"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMmRiTlVnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Seriously, the staff are very rude. I was looking forward to a happy good meal but the staff’ attitude denied me the wish.
(Actually, not even one star becos the staff’s attitude sabotaged the nice food experience). The whole team needs to be replaced soonest."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ3Btcm1BRRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"Very rude staffs! In times of pandemic like this, many F&B establishments needed support. But please bring the support to other establishment who value customers, definitely NOT Malaysia Chiak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbHJMeXN3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,3,"Price was OK, portion is just nice. The Penang Char Kuay Teow is average, fragrance is lacking, kuay teow is decent. Prawn is fresh. The chendol is also average, the bowl is small, enough as a dessert for one person. The Klang Bakut Teh is interesting. Price is reasonable and overall taste and quality is above average. Served in a heated claypot, the dish remains warm throughout the dining. Few things that is notable are the rice that is not warm and the tau kee is chewy (fried and soaked). There are a few pieces of different cut of ribs, pork belly as well as some button mushrooms. Broth is mildly spiced and tastes better with garlic. Do get the extra youtiao for added texture."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDa1BqWFJBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,Very bad staff attitude. Requested non spicy Char Koay Tiao for my kids but the staff refused to accommodate the request even there was no other customer. Reason being it is a “standard” taste for Msian CKT with chili! The Bak Kut Teh tasted terrible with low quality ingredients. Won’t go back for sure!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaGVtYkVBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,"A bit difficult to find seat during peak. The claypot rice is not bad. Chicken rice is fragrant, oily & nice. Chendol is quite miserable without much ingredients. Overall still ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMUp5VVFBEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,5,"i give it a 5 as it exceed expectation of 2.5. in malaysia, i give it a 3.

char koay teow is spicy and have wok hey. not as oily as found in penang but decent. personally like spicy.

curry mee is ok like commonly found in pasar in malaysia. should provide sambal for us to add spiciness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDa3NDcmJREAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,1,"At today 8.05pm , i was trying to order a char kuay teow from the stall and asking a plate without a beansprout as i not a fan of that. And the lady just told me that they couldn’t make it with a bad attitude  . I been here for a many times as they never say no before until today. Definitely will not recommend any of friends to here anymore . This will be the last i will be here ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX1lhekxnEAE,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,worth to try the char kway that and chendol
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMnBfUXV3RRAB,Malaysia Chiak @ City Square Mall,4,No regrets with the claypot chicken. Flavourful and generous serving of braised chicken. Nuggets of salted fish also found in the rice. Yum. Though I wish for more lap cheong every time.
