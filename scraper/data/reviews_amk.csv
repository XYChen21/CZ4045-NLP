ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN3VhSGZREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Decent cafe food. Outdoor area is pet-friendly, no pets allowed indoors. Their chicken waffle dish is worth a try! Can get pretty crowded with family and kids during dinner hours. Overall nice ambience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcHQ3V0FnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday afternoon for lunch, not much crowd on a weekday. This cafe is quite spacious, have an outdoor and indoor seating area. I ordered the Chicken waffles Chicken was tender and delicious. The only complain was quite warm indoor, seem like the air-conditional is not working. Overall, wonderful place to chill and will visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHZXdU9nEAE,Cava Singapore,5,First time coming to this cafe and will definitely go back again. It’s such a nice and comfortable place to chill in..The food is nice & My family simply love all the varieties that we have ordered.. 👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzQtbk1nEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited them on consecutive Sat and Sun! Service staffs are friendly and polite. Ordered their mushroom risotto and truffle fries for both days. It was really good! Amazingly, their coffee was a gem for us. We didn’t have high expectations on their coffee yet it was the star for our brunch. The sea salt caramel latte was da bomb! Not sweet yet very smooth and produce good aroma of the coffee. Will bring our kiddos back for the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeThEMjBRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"It's new !!! Have outdoor (pets allowed) and indoor seating. Nice, clean, spacious and cosy. Ordered the all day breakfast set which was tasty and a cafe latte. Will visit again. Only complain was the need to improve their online menu with picture of the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGREUzRnRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,We were here for the vet's appt and was so glad for a cafe that welcomes little friends. Better than that the food is very good. The pasta was fresh yet light. We also had the croffles with a very crispy chicken. I would have stayed longer for dessert but with the current humidity we have to come back when we can sit indoors without the little friend. Very good dining experience and good offering of wines too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDY2WnN3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday for brunch, was a nice and quiet place to chill. Really enjoyed the pasta, which is a recommended dish . Quite a decent amount of seafood (scallops, prawns, clams) given 👍🏼👍🏼"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHVPSlBnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,A nice cafe tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Consists of both indoor air conditioned and outdoor seating suitable for pet owners which is a plus. Ample seating space inside as the restaurant stretches quite far in. Service is good and relatively fast. Decor is pretty and they have interesting pieces of furniture and contrasting wallpapers and panels for a varied effect. Tried their speculoos latte and Peter’s Pancake which is quite good 👍😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPME1heGRBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Pretty good food and service at reasonable prices. The rosti waffles were very delicious, although we wish they could be even crispier. Pancakes are fluffy, scrambled egg is creamy, bacon is not too greasy. The melon tea smells very calming although the melon taste itself wasn't very strong. The online ordering platform was missing photos for several items, which made it hard to visualize what the dish would look like or the portion size.

Relaxing simple decor. The outdoor area is pet-friendly, lotsa cute dogs there! Indoors has plenty of seating. There is also a small garden area on the other end, with goldfishes swimming around in a little rock fountain."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnZxRzVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"Wow.. love this place for its space... wide spacious and hippy green ambience... Nice!

Simply the space and deco makes this cafe super comfortable to laze and chill in.

And I'm glad the great food goes well with ambience too..

Been here twice already. And their pastas and burger is great!

And their online loyalty program is definitely tempting me to go back a 3rd 4th time...
And its only tempting because food and ambience is great..

Would definitely be back many more times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3UzRUpBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Found a nice new cafe. Great food, pet friendly and can cycle over the next round. Just a bit longer waiting time for a seat so better to book advance 🥂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTlyQ21RRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"My first attempt lunch experience.

Personally, I like their main menu items, the savoury items are not to my liking.

Overall dining experience is good. Nice place and ambient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyekxpSkxnEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Strong contender to the existing upper Thomson road cafes like Columbus Coffee. Overall good brunch food, with nice platting and interior design. However could do better with their coffees (quite awful Americano). They should like consider providing better utensils (fork,soon) as the current ones are obviously of sub standard quality, similar to the ones we see in food court. It’s the non polished type and didn’t look or feel sparkling clean. Furthermore, all of their fork has stains between the grooves. Asked for change but all had stains. Ended up not using their fork. Lost my appetite a little. Chicken was great but wished they drained the excess oil before serving. The plate was filled with excess oil from the chicken midway during meal. Overall 3 stars with lots of potential for improvement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1ozQkRBEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Good food and pet friendly. Will visit again
Not bad for a 3 week old cafe 🙂

Update:
Went back on their 4th week of business with more friends. Waiting time improved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGFxeXhRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"A bright, beautiful, and spacious cafe with lots of greenery - reminds me of a laidback Balinese beach club/cafe. It has a open, pet-friendly outdoor seating area too!

Not your usual cafe fare, ordered a few unique items to try. They were all delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzhHM0hREAE,Cava Singapore,3,"This cafe is pretty near my place but first time trying. Reservations is recommended especially for weekends. Surprised that the indoor dining area was so big.
Found the price of the food quite expensive. Breakfast for 3 easily exceeded $100. They had a promo with Citibank but we had lots of problems with it as it couldn't accept applepay or if the credit card is stored inside the phone without the full 16 digits.
Order a few dishes to share, the one we enjoyed most is the Chicken and Croffles. Both croffles and chicken were well cooked. The Roffles platter was interesting because of the rosti waffles and also liked the way the mushrooms were cooked.
Service was very slow. Not sure if they forgot the order or what. The staff are all very young and had to call them over a few times to check the status of the dishes. The sides came almost last, the Spicy Chicken wasn't really nice it didn't taste Korean but the sauce more tasted like the Thai sweet Chili sauce. The Sakura Cream Tagliatelie also came late and serving was very small which left us unsatisfied.
Drinks were just pretty average.
Really need to improve on the speed of the food served. Not sure why the cafe wasn't even crowded at all early in the morning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0tDckJ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Lovely ambience and tasty albeit junky food, has a nice al fresco area for pet owners and their fur kids. Deep fried chicken and croffles very yummy. Fries were good too. We'll be back soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b0lxNmlBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Loved the interior design and spacious. Also has an outdoor sheltered seating area. Our group of 3 had the croffles with fried chicken, the crispy chicken burger, the rosti with mushrooms & pork sausages, chicken tenders with korean spicy sauce - all of them were decently good. The letdown came in the form of their tarts where the crust was soft, and it just felt liked it was kept for too many days."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGFMT2JREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited the place on a weekday afternoon and was delighted that there’s no crowd. Huge space with ample seating area. Had the fried chicken, sakura pasta and the creamed corn (CCB).

The pasta and chicken were great but the corn was just alright. The sour cream was not a good addition to the corn. Drinks were on the expensive side too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM0lXVzNRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Didn't expect the food to be good, but it really is! The chef does fried chicken super well. We ordered the spicy Korean fried chicken it was out of this world. The CCB is also super yummy. The CAVA burger is huge but also very tasty. My husband and I were stuffed after these three dishes due to the generous portion of the CAVA burger. For the portion, the price is very reasonable. The downside is the waiting time, it took 40 mins for us to have the first side on the table. We had to approach the service staff to check on our order. The last dish, the burger took 1 hour. Service staff is quite friendly and attentive in terms of refilling water. Easy to get their attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc0tLQ1R3EAE,Cava Singapore,2,"The colors they utilized in their interior design were fantastic. The colors are black, white, and jade green. This is a fantastic mix. I went on a Friday night when it wasn't too packed. ⁣

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2FMcGxBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Here for brunch and dinner before. The otah bruschetta with grilled cheese is a must. Dinner menu is so-so, portion can be bigger even though the food is good. Love the place as it allowed furkid to accompany the hoomans under shelter. Nice cafe in a quiet estate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnNmR2pnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"May 2022: This cafe has really good potential. Love the space - bright and spacious. Food was also good. Order the Cava Burger (chicken thigh) and the wild mushroom pasta. Both delicious. I liked how the cheese was melted on the bun and the mushrooms in the chicken burger. There is an option to choose wagyu meat instead of chicken for $2 additional but I read about how good the fried chicken was and hence was not about to lose this opportunity to taste it! Was happy I didn’t! Anyway, I wonder how the burger which included a slice of pineapple would taste if I had chose wagyu!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1B1SmZnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"5 stars service, staff very patient and polite. They have special food and drink. Delicious and satisfying. The pet friendly zone is spacious without worrying about rain or hot weather."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2FhaVp3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,"It's a spacious cafe with welcoming staff. Ordered the mentaiko fries - which was great for sharing. The salmon was well executed but we didnt really appreciate the rosti. Overall, its a nice find in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaUw3WUxBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Love the recommended dishes : Sakura Tagliatelle, Cava Burger. Food is really good, best part I can get to see beautiful fur patrons playing at the outdoor area. Didn't enjoy the lemon meringue tart though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a09EVUZ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great neighbourhood cafe with brunch food. Rather big space lots of seating outside and inside. We ordered the fried chicken and croffles, mentaiko fries and the mushroom risotto.

The fried chicken was really well battered, light and crispy and not oily. The coleslaw was also a really nice touch cause I’m not a fan of putting maple syrup on my savoury food. I would say a must try when you come here.

The mushroom risotto was everything you would want in a risotto dish. Simple and rice was cooked just right (slightly Al dente but cooked through).

Mentaiko fries were decent but nothing special.

You order and pay through a QR code which is always a plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldDhUbDZBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"We came here after seeing Daniel Food Diary’s review (though we know to take all the bloggers’ reviews with a big pinch of salt).

In a nutshell, the food here is decent. Just skip the desserts and the coffee (which is a collaboration with local Hook coffee but the cafe does not have a barista in house). After lunch, simply hop over to Thus Coffee which is just around the corner.

It’s nice, quiet and spacious spot for catching up over lunch. On a Monday noon, it wasn’t crowded at all. We had a nice far end spot where behind the doors is the backyard with a water well.

We ordered the otah bruschetta (sourdough), seafood aglio olio, fishy business (salmon), roffles platter and wild mushroom risotto. All of us rather enjoyed our respective main course.

Thereafter, we shared the ondeh ondeh cake, yuzu cheesecake and a warm apple crumble and also had cups of coffee.

The Apple crumble looked really funky and unnatural (take a look at the last photo) plus it was too sweet. The ondeh ondeh was nothing to rave about either. Coffee was served without inspiration (no latte art cos as mentioned, no barista) - it was just bland, normal coffee but at a barista price tag of $7."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNThPX3lnRRAB,Cava Singapore,3,"Do reserve before going especially on a weekend as it can get packed.

First visit - Order didn't go through the online ordering system and we ended up waiting for awhile to realise it didn't go through. But technical fault, can't be helped. Anyway, reordered and our food came in adequate time. The spinach cream pasta was quite nice.

Second visit - Decided to try the otah, and sakura pasta. Interesting menu, both were alright.

In both visits, the drinks were slightly underwhelming. Nice atmosphere and staff though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb19iNUFREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went there for lunch recently for a family of 5. Overall food is nice and the service is good. However, and that is a HUGE but, the waiting time for the food is ridiculously long at 70 minutes after ordering!!

They did let us know that waiting time for food will be at 30 minutes or more. I think it is good that they let customers know that they need to wait. Hmm... but we waited for 70 minutes... AND even if there is lots of pre-warning or notification that food may take some time to prepare, waiting for 70 minutes for the food is not acceptable. They really need to look into streamlining the process or expanding the kitchen capacity to have faster turn around time.

Apart from that, please do make reservation ahead! With such a long turn around time from ordering food to serving, you don't want to be queueing outside waiting for table + waiting for food later!

The service of this place is good. There are many attentive young servers.

Food wise, it is tasty and unique. Some notable dishes are the Spinach Creatm Tagliatelle ($15), Seafood Aglio Olio ($15),  CCB (Cream Corn Bacon $9). We ordered quite a lot of other stuff too. Can look at the photos. Food wise, it is 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNXRDYmVnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Beautiful interior and very spacious, quiet on thurs evening. Food was veryyyy average. Melon tea by the pot, teabag type. Speculoos Cafe Latte was good because its totally not sweet at all though the name. Roffles Platter was very homemade... the roffles was not crispy and abit mushy. Sakura Cream Tagliatelle Pasta was below average, too much residue water from the seafood so the whole dish was very watery but the prawns were fresh. Seafood Aglio Olio was average. Fries with truffle & parmesan was good, very generous and huge serving, highly recommend. Visited this cafe to celebrate a friend's birthday so we also ordered a Lemon Meringue Tart which didnt taste fresh, below average.

Will recommend this place only for small bites and drinks. Good for a teatime break."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaU9XbERREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great all-day brunch and coffee. I had the open faced wagyu sandwich and my wife tried the Rosti waffle platter which is gluten free. Both are well presented and tasty. It is cavernous inside with lots of space and good ambience. Pets are allowed in their outdoor seating, which is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0tpcnVBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,A really spacious cafe newly opened just months ago. Comfortable and cosy seating.. serving great pasta towards the Asian texture. Love❤️ the small portions available for the small eaters🥰 #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcC1lQUhBEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Was looking for coffee after dinner and stumbled upon this cafe. Big and spacious dinning area. There is also a huge alfresco dinning area where you can bring your pets along. Very comfortable environment. At around 9+pm was still quite crowded on a Friday nite.

Cafe pricing is on the pricier side for this order. Drinks are quite unique. Ordered the iced puffed rice cafe latte and a hot speculoos cafe latte.

Puffed rice went quite well with the latte adding some texture. Giving a cereal feel when it is soaked up with latte. Recommended to try. Speculoos latte is ok but hope that they can be more generous with the speculoos topping.
Cheesecake is average.

Nice place to chill after dinner. Will be back to try their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnRLekl3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,Came with hubby and kids on Sunday late afternoon . Kids and pets friendly . Quite a busy cafe at that hour so I think quite suitable for noisy kids to dine in . Ambience was great as I faced to a small tropical garden ! Love the plants especially for plant lovers . haha . I think chicken croffle was not bad-recommended . English BF and spam fries soso. Cappucino can be better ( quite bitter ) as I think the other cafe around the corner has better coffee . I was expecting better coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ2ZiYnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Great ambience, nice deco plus 5 stars for presentation! Melted nacho cheese dripped over the entire Wagyu burger served with fries. Lovely idea. Was expected a patty but it was yakiniku Wagyu but I'm not complaining cos it was well done. Impressive. Just didn't like that fries served was only warm, likely fried and put aside for quite a while. Waffle and chicken wasn't that fantastic according to my lunch companion. But still, decent for sure. Wash it all down with a pint for a wonderful dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDc2NkZREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Celebrated Father’s Day here. Coming here to try the food because it’s recommended by danielfooddiary. The food is fantastic. We tried the otah bread, ice latte, croffle chicken & seafood pasta. Price wise is $20 ish per pax. Ambience is good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNFoyUnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,Pet friendly cafe in a quiet neighborhood. Quality of food is better than expected but selection range not wide- wish they have more desserts choices~
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaUxDWlNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Had the mushroom linguine, mentaiko fries and spinach pasta. Enjoyed all of them. Portion size was good, mentaiko was very flavourful and had a torched flavour. Mushroom linguine had a generous amount of mushrooms and they were cooked well without too much of an earthy taste.

Could improve the acoustics in the restaurant though as there were not many people but it was very noisy. Good place to hold events but if it's so echoey it will not be conducive.

Do check out the well. It had a few dead leaves though. And the door to the back garden was locked.

Also there was a super smiley server, she was really cheerful, wish all servers were like her."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM09qcXRRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Good cafe, good choice of items/menu and friendly staff. Prices very acceptable for this area as well. We had the chicken croffles and the otah bruschetta, both tasted really good. Don't know what it is, but it's just missing the x-factor for a five star review."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM1BiRWRREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Food is ok and environment is good. Nice outdoor place for people who wants to bring their pets over to chill.

This places serves western food. Can get pretty crowded and noisy during dinner times.

A little far from MRT, but this place is worth the distance.

Will definitely come back here for more next time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLU5ycUNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Food is very yummy, and place is very bright and roomy. The croffle and chicken was a big hit with everyone, and I loved the chicken burger as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3NHTjFBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"C.C.B was my favourite dish! Head down to the cafe to find out what I mean 😉

Attracted to the amazing ambience of this cafe! I highly recommend all of you to have a sense of it too!

- Food; EXCELLENT!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️ The food display was exquisite, the food taste just as pleasant as how it looks (I took video instead of photos, cant post it)

- Chill outdoor; can bring your pet along, I saw one doggo 😍 (it’s open 24/7 according to one of the bosses)

- Cozy indoor; the furnishing of the cafe felt like I was in a HIGH END restaurant with affordable food, there are high chairs, sofas, and other different types of sitting to choose from (closes at 10-10.30pm)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjZMYmdnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Location: Pet friendly cafe located near a vet, a small park, catsmart, petlovers, and a nearby cafe to chill with your pooches after having a walk at lower pierce reservoir, ample parking.

Cafe: Came here a few times. Cafe is very spacious for small and big groups but price wise is a bit on the high side. I find a cup of cappuccino at $7 quite exp. Got the caramelized (coffee with a whip of caramel at $8). Food is acceptable & bug portion but not so fantastic. Service is very good, staff will immediately ask a choice of cold or warm water, and provide a water for the pooch too. We'll come back for small bites and some drinks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWNiVnZRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Interesting place to dine at a hidden corner. It has a “secret” garden that’s quite cool too with mist timing. Food is nice and ambiance is cosy, clean and spacious. 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHB1SXVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"The cafe is very Instagramable , it’s nice for chill out n photo n meeting up with friends , beer r very affordable price .
Owners r friendly couple
Chicken is too small portion size can be improved, maybe add more vege to make it feel more worth it , we prefer smth that is bigger portion. Coffee is a little bitter , can be improved.
The English breakfast cauliflower is not really fantastic, it will be better if u can change it to mash potatoes or sweet corn or potatoes salad . The bread is too thin n small it will be better if u guys can change to a thicker one . Taste wise is perfect . Like a 4 star restaurant. Thumbs up owner ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNkxLS0RREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Nice and spacious cafe in the quiet Sembawang Hills with friendly staff. Seems to be pet-friendly with many customers with dogs out front.

Had typical cafe food with some interesting twists e.g. Nacho Cheese on Wagyu Burger, Rose Matcha Latte. However feels slightly pricy, even for a cafe, (~$20), especially if you order cmmon cafe food

Would recommend to try if you're in the area, and get the more special foods on the menu (like Otah Bruschetta) instead of things like the typical American Breakfast set."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGRLZFR3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,Spacious restaurant with a modern deco. Attentive and prompt service. Good food.with little pleasant surprises.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWU2WVpBEAE,Cava Singapore,2,"Pet-friendly place. I wouldn’t say it’s fantastic or novel but I tried it because of the good reviews. The otah bruschetta was thin and laid on top of a slice white bread. It’s quite hard to cut and dry. In terms of spiciness and taste, I’ll rate it 2/5. In the end, i grab it with my hands and eat it. I don’t think it’ll order it again because it’s not worth $18 (add $2 for cheese topping). Coffee is so-so ($7 up)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajdiT3l3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a Thursday evening and the space was quiet and serene! A lot of space between tables which made it a plus for an already dog friendly establishment. Service staff were attentive and responsive. Ordered three mains: Sakura ebi tagliatelle, seafood aglio olio and a small breakfast plate, found them all to be nice! Hot latte was also good! But apple crumble was very disappointing cos it was soft and mushy, hence minus one star!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eG9XdGJ3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"The food is really good. Good ambience for a restaurant to be situated in an educational institution. I love the flavour of the food and one of the better orh nee yam paste dessert. Will go again. So good that we left nothing behind. The crab is not their best dish though. I will omit the crab. The sauce is good, the problem is the size of the crab. Not big enough. Opt for bigger size crab should solve the problem."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ192dEJREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"First time trying this place (or perhaps I’ve been here many years ago but can’t really recall). It’s located inside ITE at AMK and is really convenient for those who drive with its ample car park and location just off CTE.

The food is delicious and sizeable. The one dish that stood out was their Peking duck. It seemed like every other table ordered one when we were there. The fat and juicy skin was not lost when cut and well preserved.

It was very packed and full on the Saturday night when I went and I must say that you will definitely need to make reservation first. And oh, this is a family restaurant so it’ll be bound to be busy, noisy etc. Hence I’m surprised with some of the other comments about the noise - you want peace and quiet, please choose a fine dining restaurant or Angie’s where there’s a surcharge for noisy children 🤣"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXZxVldnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"This restaurant is not the usual ones that you can find in shopping malls as it is actually located inside ITE College Central nearby nanyang polytechnic as well as Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang MRT. It is fairly accessible via buses as well because there is 1 bus stop just outside the campus.

The restaurant serves traditional kind of chinese style cuisine, the ones you will normally find at weddings, zhi char style and etc. On a weekday, they serve mainly the students and teachers at eh ite and during weekends, you can expect to see more members of the public patronising the restaurant. The interior looks very classic and it resembles alot like the traditional chine restaurant where I attended wedding as a small kid in the 90's era.

Food wise, nothing to should about. I think it's really pretty decent and average. The prices are definitely on the higher side as they are restaurant based. Some of the must try dishes includes perking duck, prawns and claypot tofu. The servers and staff are friendly and will accommodate to what you need. Top up of drinks, refilling of tea were also prompt.

Overall, it's a pretty good experience and I look forward to come back in the near future if I'm craving for perking duck. You can take a walk around the school after the meal as the campus is pretty huge and no students are there during weekends. There is also a sheng siong supermarket nearby so you can shop there before heading home."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZzRHUzV3RRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"The experience with the staff was not the most pleasant and same goes for the food . Set menus came with chilli crab that only consisted of 1 small crab and 4 mantous even for a table of 10 people . The food was average and nothing to praise , for the shellfood like abalone , it was overcooked and super rubbery according to my family members . There is indeed a need for improvement in the cooking preparations and taste ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNE52ZXl3RRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Decent Chinese restaurant hidden within AMK ITE. Good location for a family gathering. Food wise was normal, nothing much to rave about. Prices was affordable. Service was good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbFBUNGlnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Excellent service form the crew, especially the restaurant lady manager.

Highly customer focus, provides good recommendation and very attentive to customer needs.

Great Cantonese food with good promotions, on top of that you get a 155 discount!

The Ireland peking duck is stunning, juicy, plump and delicious. It is succulent, very tender and nicely de-skinned by the staff right in front of you, perfectly wrapped in the serving skin with a nice sauce.

Shark's fin was excellent with this promotional price, served piping hot, HUGE piece of whole fin. The broth is so tasty, topped with bean sprouts

Wasabi prawns is good, could be better if the wasabi flavour be more pronounced, that's purely personal as some people may not be able to take the heat

Char siew and roast pork are to die for! good layers of fat for the char siew and roast pork flavour is good with a crispy skin

Overall dishes looks good. Been there twice already and making plans for the 3rd visit.

To the crew and chef, keep it UP. It's a good restaurant that bothers to keep their image and service, under any circumstances."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMzZLenJBRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Another ordinary Chinese restaurant but with commendable customer service. Perfect Peking duck should be sliced thinly with nearly no meat sticking on the skin. Whereas, what they serve is just the opposite☹️.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2azdQQkNBEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Nice ambience and kind, proactive staffs. The peking duck and yam ring were delicious. We had a great meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2XzliLWdnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,Tried the Ireland Peking Duck. Very good. Promotion $58. Usually price $88. Worth it. Ireland duck bigger and more juicy than the normal duck.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcmVDT2VnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Quiet place so can avoid crowds and yet have Chinese food. Came on public holiday during lunch. There are promotion & unique dishes too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbS1QX1BREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,3,Staff was friendly and attentive. I was the second customer in the restaurant so the food was served very fast. Alice who served my table was prompt with request a humble hard working staff. Peking duck was roasted skilfully. The skin was light and fluffy but the meat marination was not good enough some part of it we can still taste a gamy smell. Spring onion and cucumber was a little dry. No presentation the wrap was all stack up in a pile served on a side plate $40 standard I can’t complain. The prawn cake was nice and crispy. The hot and sour soup and braised shark fin soup was both very starchy can’t taste much of the soup base. Green veg was decent. The worst is their signature deep fried honey coated mushroom. Full of flour! Wonder where the mushroom go? The credit and saviour of the dinner is their O NEEE.... the yam paste dessert. Smooth... melt in your mouth. Will be back there again for Chinese New Year eve dinner hope the festive dishes will be more appealing and appetising.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWZmbXlnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,1,"We booked several tables for an event and ordered the food well before hand. We were at the restaurant at 6.30pm. At 9.00pm, some of the dishes are still not served. Food too too long to arrive. Best to skip this place if you want to host a successful dinner event. Food is nice, but just not worth the time and effort."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d1BicmF3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Significant improvement on the food comparing to my first visit. Was thinking of holding more again but the service from the service crew greatly discourage me from going again. I do not understand why, is it because we did not order as per advise from the male captain? First Culinary, I supposed your response is highly appreciated. Hope to hear from you soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NVpxa2lBRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,2,"Food is good. Services needs to improve.
The crispy pork is a must try. Shark fins come in huge portion. The others are so so. The service needs to improve. Many aunties working. Never ask before changing the plates, after changing the plate. Even dare to wipe the fingers on our wipes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeXBiX2xRRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"A pleasant find in Ang Mo Kio area, which had a quiet environment for group meals. Service is good and fairly fast. Chinese dishes are generally tasty. Their signature duck is good, especially the Peking duck. Enjoyed the vegetable dishes, which weren't oily nor laden with monosodium glutamate. Doesn't leave you feeling thirsty after the meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDb3A2d2l3RRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Food here is consistently good. Service staff is commendable too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDhPVkxBEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"I'm surprised. Food is good. The duck, salted egg yoke prawn, yam dessert... all good. 6 x fresh steam scallop only $18.

I will return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTa0xHOE93EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Good value. Lobster and sharks fin on promo is of decent size. Taste wise not the best but better than many mid range restaurants.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cjhpNU9REAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"Celebrated my sister's birthday there. A total of 5 pax dining. Total about s$230+.

We ordered Peking duck, duck meat fried noodle, salted egg prawns, claypot eggplant, pork ribs, double boiled black garlic chicken soup, 3 orh nee-pumpkin dessert and 1xue er dessert and 1 mango pomelo dessert.

My mum particularly loved the Peking duck, orh nee dessert and the claypot brinja.  I like the double boiled soup.

Nice ambience and a waitress assigned to us was a very polite Malaysian lady. Her service was excellent.  The food is quite good.  I like it that it was not too crowded and we had a very attentive waitress who served us well. Will go back for the 10pax set menu in the near future. Worth a try !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXRYd2xRRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Ordered the items online for self-collect. Was worried about quantity so I called beforehand to ask and the staff was very kind to review my order and advise. I was updated about the order status promptly and order was available on time.  Food portion is generous and the passion fruit prawn, salted egg ribs and fish fillet with kailan were crowd favorite! Will skip the sweet and sour mushroom next time as the flour coating was too thick but overall very pleased with the tasty meal and the pleasant experience! Thumbs up! Will revisit soon :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNnNELVdnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,I love the food here and the quiet cosy ambience. My then fiance randomly searched for a nearby venue for our wedding lunch reception and found this place. We have dined here several times and always good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXRfU1RREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,1,"55 Minutes to Serve Fried Rice

Off all the order which was served within 20-30 minutes, It took 55 minites and 4 request to expedite our order for Vegetarian Fried Rice.

While the other dishes were served, timely, it got so cold since it had to eaten along with fried rice.

Restaurant was occupied at about 60% only and 55 minutes to serve fried rice was to stretched.

Date of Visit 13-Sep, around 12:10."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aThLbEF3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,1,"For the pricing of this restaurant, the food is definitely not up to the mark.  There are many more better Teochew restaurants in town, that charge the same price, but serve much better quality food.  Do not bother to try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXFQWUl3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,Excellent restaurant situated in ITE Ang Mo Kio. Dishes are exquisitely prepared. Must go and try. Their pu er tea is super special mixed with glutinous rice. Lobsters are really something!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnN1lIazdnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Ambience was good.  Ordered 4 dishes for a family of 3.  Prawn pancake and the hor fun were good but have to eat it while it is hot.  Poarched chicken was normal and egg plant was too oily.  Overall rating was above normal.  Price a little steep.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbTR2SExnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Ordered the promo chilli crab & Peking duck. Both are nice but have to top up $15 to fry the duck meat with Ee Fu noodles, the fried noodle is little too salty.
The salted egg prawns are very dry and not creamy.
If there is no promotion, food items are considered pricey as the serving portions are small."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bHN2dFBBEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,Good food good service at reasonable prices. Set meals are a good deal with good spread of nice food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcDRUYlBREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Honestly a hidden gem! Food items on the menu are pretty pricey but they always have promotion on Special dishes like Peking Duck, chilli crabs which make the visit a fairly sweet deal. I love the KL-styled char siew and Peking duck. Definitely worth a try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcnVTSm5BRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"Very good quality food cooked in traditional taste and decent service. Only downside is that food would be considered to be on the salty side, and price is on the pricey side"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJb1pLblR3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"Went there for lunch during one of the weekend. Food is nice, service is good, place is clean. A little bit on the costly but overall I will still recommend this place.

My personal liking goes to the bittergound bee hoon and the oyster mee sua."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMweE56NFlREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"The signature sio bak was good, being crispy and a little chewy with a good lean to fat ratio.  At $15, it was a little on the pricey side.

We also liked the chai poh Teochew hor fun, which had wok hei.  The manageress recommended we try the steamed scallop dumplings with roe, but we found them on the fishy side, similar to the siew mai.

The fried radish cakes were okay, but the egg tarts were good.

Ambience and service were okay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMWRYa29nRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"If you are looking for authentic Cantonese dishes, this is one restaurant that you would want to be in your list to check out. I use of my own photo and some from their site as the dishes was eaten too fast by my family. Love their roasted crispy pork! It's really awesome, must order! We order the longevity bun in advance as we are celebrating our mother's birthday. Which is better than those i had as theirs are handmade with nice warm, not so sweet pure lotus paste. Well, i could go on for more but go try it yourself. Oh! last thing, portion are big if you order medium like me."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbkpQbDhRRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Ordered peking duck and chilli crab for delivery. Both taste good. Crab very fresh, full of meat. Must try. Free delivery charge for order above 80."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaHFDcDlnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"Food were decently nice. Ambience like a typical Chinese restaurant. Prices soso, but cheap if presented the ite alumni card.

We had my dad birthday dinner at first culinary.  Had notably memorable kl style char siew, Peking duck (duck from Ireland). The rest were normal chinese restaurant food. No complaints.

Went on a weekday evening. Not much crowd.

If travel by public transport, not the most easy. Have to take bus to reach to destination."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5N0tDcU5BEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Very good service, food was very good too. Surprise food gem at ITE College Central."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbFlPSFJnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"It was a bit hard to navigate around when inside the ITE but other than that it was quite a pleasant experience! Love the char siew and sio bar. Very cosy restaurant, suitable for family dinner!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcGZlVTFBRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"Spacious, comfortable and good ambience restaurant located in the ITE! Good customer service and friendly staff, recommend us a lot of signature dishes! Highly recommended!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycHI2dzlnRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,"I liked this restaurant for the good food.  They are very well prepared and delicious.  However,  when I was there with my family 2 weeks ago,  it was super crowded and noisy.  Too many families having birthday celebrations and moving around making it hard to hold our conversations."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNzhyS0RBEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Good Chinese restaurant quality food at reasonable prices. Nice ambience - quieter, less hectic. Suggest for you to make reservation first before heading down especially for bigger groups."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc09YMEh3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Food is ok and reasonably priced, but service needs much improvement. Service staff Amy portioned our food out of our sight behind a pillar, so we don't even know if she indeed served us all the fish or all the noodles or all the orh nee etc.

She also ignored our feedback that our dishes were not served in the order we'd like. Noodles were ready as the 5th course when it should have been the 7th. We told her about it, she acknowledged and read out the remaining courses from our ordering chit and brought the big plate of noodles away so we thought she served it to another table. But turns out she just brought it behind the pillar to portion it out for all of us.

Also, a few staff served us at least 2 rounds of diluted-until-cannot tea until we asked to change the tea bag. Did they not see that the liquid they were pouring into our cups was clear and not at all brown?

And not sure what the staff were rushing for since we left about 30min to closing so it can't be for a next seating...my sister's plate and cutlery were cleared just as soon as she bit into a piece of pork, she didn't even have the chance to use her chopsticks to shift the meat to a more comfortable position in her mouth because the chopsticks were already gone as soon as she put them down on her plate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXLTYzSlNBEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,3,"Ordered their set dinner for 5 pax. The first half of the dishes are nice. However, the last 3 dishes were overly salty, the veg, the brocoli and the noodle with duck. All five of us found it too salty. We paid closed to $500, for this price, there are much better restaurant out there. Service is above average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRenBYaFBnEAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Nice Chinese food in neighbourhood area. Always crowded during weekends. Located in ITE Central.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMGZXRUFREAE,First Culinary Restaurant,4,Went there for chinese new year and the food was excellent. Especially the carb noodles. The pork was crispy and tender

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLWQzZDRRRRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,4,The service is excellent. Truly appreciate that the staff keep refilling the tea in our glass. The fish is fresh. Food is delicious. The roasted meat is nice but slightly hard. I have a wonderful lunch time. Thank you!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzd01XZ3l3RRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,Awesome service and sweet crew who gifted my daddy longevity peaches for his birthday. They even made it fresh cos they ran out of it. Thank you!!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLWVYZmh3RRAB,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Really wonderful food to satisfy even the sharpest of tongues in my family.
I tried almost everything on the menu already and can say..... I'll be back as everything is very well done.
Best part is..... the pricing is so fair and it's a wonder they are not yet on Michelin or Bill Gourmand.... keep up the standard"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdXFhSGF3EAE,First Culinary Restaurant,5,"Chanced upon it at ITE Central, during the open house today. The waitresses were professional in noting my mum's allergies, and were polite. The dishes were presented beautifully, and the food was great. Wouldn't mind coming back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNDRUVmlBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,5,"Service was attentive and thoughtful. Staff were very accommodating and fulfilled our request to change to another table (although only after a second request) even though they were very busy. Drinks were topped up promptly. But do take note that there is an interesting charge of $2.50 per head even if you do not drink tea, eat the peanuts or use the wet towels. Food was good but not spectacular."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyejZENE5REAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,5,"Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was very quiet, which we appreciated. We ordered the 6-pax course meal and really enjoyed the food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dmNmWE9BEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"First time trying this place on a weekday dinner. No queue. Was invited to join an extended family gathering dinner. Did not managed to take many pictures because was busy entertaining people. Parking is easy. The place is renovated like the environment for wedding dinner. Food and price are decent but I dont like the fish maw soup. Prompt customer service, friendly staff. Worth trying this place with family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaktTeXRnRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"Love the traditional variety type of Chinese food here. The roast duck and chicken were crispy and well done as usual. The cold combination dish was great too! The sliced garoupa fish dish turned out fresh and flavourful, the way I love it! My fave must be the braised tofu with tau kee as it was superbly done with broth that was not too starchy, just right and really tasty!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNG9lOWlBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,2,"Standard of food dropped significantly from the first few times of our patronising before CB period; service was decent but the food does not justify the value of food paid for. Very disappointing.

As requested by owner, purely on personal taste buds and opinion:-

1) 金龙鸡 (chicken with sotong paste): there was hardly any sotong paste it’s just deep fried skin with sauce. On previous occasions you could clearly see distinct paste filling. If it were for cost cutting measures, please do so without compromising the dish.

2) 菠菜(vegetable): the vegetables tasted tough to the teeth were slightly salty and did not appear as fragrant as before. Overall, was tougher to ingest and can be improved.

3) lobster with boiled rice: the lobster meat appeared dull and stuck to the shell and did not appear as fresh. The soup was slightly fishy to the taste buds.

4) hae chor: the fillings were less crunchy and not as well done, it was previously very well fried and crispy, but on this occasion it was barely so.

5) braised pork bun: the braised pork were tougher to the bite, but overall decent, save for the bigger portions of fatty meat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdC15dTBBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"have ordered a couple of rice dumplings with abalone, unfortunately the nice pyramid packaging was run out.😪

it was peppery but it was big with lots of different ingredients and it tasted great overall!  recommended!  shall buy more next year!! 😋"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMDVEcEhREAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,All dishes are pretty decent except for the scallop. The scallop dish was cold and the scallop not fresh at all. Service wise was not up to standard. Waitress tonality towards answering customer questions was bad. she does answer question but her tonality would need to be improved as she somewhat seem to brush customer off.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLUxhbG9BRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"Satisfied - Happy and pleased with the delivery and quality of the food. I ordered a mini buffet service. Food was warm and well-packed when delivered. Drinks and cutlery were provided. The sauce for the fried fish was seperate to prevent the fish from getting soggy. Portion size was sufficient for 10 pax.

Dissapointed with the lack of followup service.
Called them on Friday night to enquire about the mini buffet service but did not receive any updates from them even though they say they will send me a WhatsApp message. Have to call them again later and the person told me to make an online order.

Meanwhile I would like to thank staff Xin Yun for assisting me with change of delivery timing when I called Gimtim on Saturday evening. 👍

Other than the lack of followup service, I would highly recommend others to use their online system to place order for mini buffet. It's well-worth the money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaE5XRDRBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,5,"Food's delicious! Their signature duck and pork in the bun is amazingly good. The rest of the food that we ordered were good as well, but it was the duck that melted in my mouth and keeps me dreaming of the next time I go back.

I think they served an extra appetiser (fried fish skin) that was crisp, tasty, but still light.

We were seated all the way in a corner, so, sometimes it was hard to signal to the wait staff, but otherwise, food is great. I think the external seating is just for the Lunar New Year festivities, as it doesn't look permanent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwN0lMMHZ3RRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,Attended a wedding dinner here and I enjoyed the entire night. Food is good. Service is nice. I don’t feel like being rushed. And my wine is always filled without me noticing it. Jia You!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcDkzWlVREAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,Tasty food. Reasonable prices. Decor is pretty plain but compensated by the quality of the food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcTlfQlFREAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"Went there to have reunion dinner. The restaurant is located at the HDB block. Decent food, good service. Paid $468++ for a table of 8. Considered slightly expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanB1ZzhBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,Impressed with the food and service provided. The food was decently priced and delicious.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd08yOWxBRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Restaurant seems to not be able to handle the crowd after ease of dining measures. Called ahead for a reservation and booked for 4. We approached the staff to confirm attendance and “enjoyably” waited for 46 mins (20 upon 20 mins and more), paying for carpark to enjoy the “majestic view” of staff serving tables for customers waiting after mine. They also kindly advised that we will only be able to get our seats after tables have enjoyed their dessert (an estimated additional 20 mins). Went before the easing of measures and food and service was still good. As for now, kindly reserve and enjoy at your own risk."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcmRlMkFnEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,Used to be good food here! Standard has dropped a lot and they skimed on the ingredients. Not worth a visit anymore.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3aDRQblJBEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,Food is not bad. But we waited very Long for the next dish to arrive. Like 20 minutes?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXc1plSWZREAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,5,One of my all time favourite restaurant. Really good food at very reasonable prices. The helpings are generous and everyone in the family loves the food!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbThxNjd3RRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,5,"Casual Chinese restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Serves all the classic dishes like fried noodles /rice, stir fries, braised dishes, seafood, etc. Their house made tofu, whole roast chicken, yam basket, and braised pork buns are worth trying. There is a clean toilet for customers as well. Can be crowded on weekends (pre-covid), so work booking a table ahead."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMFpyRmpRRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,Don't understand the hype at all. Food was average. In fact it was way below average. The other 4 or 5 stars reviews are probably paid reviews to deceive the public. Avoid at all cost.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOU03ZktnEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Tea was added with lots of water, asked to change but said that it was like that, but ended up being able to serve much darker pu er. Pretty sure they served pu er they even said they added water because they were afraid we couldnt sleep at night 😇
Pai gu was really hard!!
worse on top of all these is that toufu which is the fastest to make was not even served after 2 reminders...as we see food on other tables streaming in.
WORSE DINING EXPERIENCE DID NOT FEEL SINCERE AND REMORSEFUL."

Back Chang with scallops was very good for the price point. Taste was v good. Not oily. Not jilark.

Will definitely buy again.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbTdmZGNnEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Do not ever book a wedding banquet with this restaurant. I booked a wedding banquet on November 2019 for my wedding to be held at Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre (SCCC) on December 2020. Due to the covid-19 situation, SCCC had refunded me the booking deposit for the venue. However, Gim Tim (the caterer) abide by their “non-refundable” deposit and forced us to use the deposit to invite our guests for a meal at their premises under a HDB void deck. As a wedding is a once in a lifetime event, and Gim Tim was reluctant to refund us with our deposit, we were forced to get our guests to their premises at Ang Mo Kio. I had since then swear on telling everyone I know of to not patron Gim Tim. My family and extended family will never ever visit or dine at Gim Tim ever again. Please think twice before you spend money in this restaurant. There are so many restaurants in Singapore and will you ever want to help a restaurant who behaves and acts in such a manner in difficult times?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhb0xXZkh3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"The failure of including the longevity birthday bun (of great significance) for order of their celebration set. C'mon, how many of a 70s does a person have? Your terrible act has spoilt a birthday celebration!  A promised return call to be made by their supervisor took hours (claimed that they were very busy when I am told that the call will be made within the next hour) and it was near their wind down operation hours by then.   A slipshod reply ""we might have gotten too busy and we have forgot to pack in the longevity bun. We offer free desert at your next visit"" - is that your method of service recovery? Do you even see the point that you have ruined a celebration by missing out on the most important item?!  And the food was way too salty!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQweWI2bXpnRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Do not order the Orh Ni (Yam paste coconut dessert) . The one we ordered was sour. Upon checking with the staff, they admit the ingredients were from nights before and prepared a new bowl. The chef even came out to stare at us angrily for no good reason. The new bowl have a stale vegetable oil smell. The rest of the dishes were ok and their service was mediocre. It was not priced to their standards. At the same price range we could've gone peach garden and avoided all this. They used to be good not now. Not that great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjcjVMekt3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Poor delivery service  as when the food arrived to our doorstep it was already cold.

The delivery was supposed to come from 11.30 pm to 12.30 pm but it only came at 1pm without the full order as it lacked the condiments like the sauce and cucumbers for the peking duck ( had to wait for another hour for it).My daughter had to rush off to work without having a Father's day meal together with the family because of the late and incomplete delivery.

The quality of the food was subpar to the standards provided when dining in.Quantity of the peking duck was so much more lesser compared to the one we had when we dined in at your restaurant and the crackers lost their crispiness.

Overall disappointed with the delivery and not worth ordering delivery again for such big occassion as our Father day's lunch was ruined and everyone was left frustrated after this late delivery."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzak5fN0R3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"January 24 Dinner.
If you want to come to this restaurant, please expect the following:

1. Air-con was not turned on prior to guest arrival. Guest have to remind them.
2. Dishes were served wrong and have to be reminded as well.
3. Interval of each dishes is 20 mins and food was cold when they arrived.
4. Demand payment when we are not even halfway through the dinner.

If you can meet the demands of the crowd, don't accept them in the first place. All the best to your business."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVNDZMbkZBEAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"Ordered several dishes, if I recall about 6 dishes only. Each time a dish is served, the next takes 15 minutes. That’s fine, but what is totally disappointing is the lack of quality in our food. The crab was bitter and slimey and the meat was either too salty or underseasoned.

Rather than keep up a facade of a finer dining experience (interior and atmosphere really reminded of a wedding dinner), perhaps they should look into improving the quality of the food instead, just a suggestion.

Best Thing Here: Fried Fish Skin, Peanuts
Avoid: Everything Else"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbXVIVHpRRRAB,Gim Tim Restaurant,4,"Been dining at this place occasionally for a few years now, generally the food is good and service staffs are prompt.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdlo2YVN3EAE,Gim Tim Restaurant,1,"This is a warning for everyone. For the price that you pay here, you will get non-existent service and food that is worse than what you will get at hawker centre.

From the beginning, their service staff did not care about our needs; half their staff kept glancing at their watch and pretending to be busy. The seating was too close and uncomfortable. The tea was watered down. The sound system broke and was horribly managed.

The food is even worse. The roasted pork was partially uncooked on the inside, with the skin side being extremely tough and tasteless. The appetizers (lotus paste bun and other assortments) looked suspiciously like what I could buy from the FairPrice supermarket cheaply, and were poorly prepared.

The ""sashimi"" turned out to be cheap raw red grouper that was meant to be cooked in hot soup, which was merely a thin broth with some herbs and too many red dates. The pot's fully metal ladle was left in the boiling soup, scalding our attempts to get it out. In addition, the staff walked around with the burner lit dangerously close to our hair.

The spinach and vegetables set was tough, cooked in a pot of overly salted water using cheap fried anchovies. To add insult to injury, when I brought champagne there, the staff did not care to ensure it was chilled.

The exterior of the restaurant was dirty and wet with what looked like the tossed out leftovers of food. If you are going there, wearing shorts and cheap sandals will be a suitable choice.

All in all, the price you pay at this restaurant ensures you obtain bad service, badly cooked food, and an extremely uncomfortable dining experience. For the same price, you can dine for far better at Imperial Treasures, or a classy Japanese restaurant, or even a well-run restaurant.

You have been warned."

Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the vegetable spring rolls and pan fried buns. Would say portion wise is really small. But it's good enough not to over eat. Average cost per dish is $6.

The beef soup noodles- in the menu pic, the beef portions look ‘substantial or decent portions’ but when it came, it only had three skillet pieces!!!  And it was not cheap!!

The dried ‘spring rolls’ were gooey, which I understand that’s their norm but it was incredibly oily.

Personally the steamed dumplings skin was a bit on the thick side.

Oh yea the deep fried tau sar pau was truly truly oily and the tau sar portions were so pathetic… and did I say oily ?
As was the deep fried dumplings…. Both had thick portions of skin.

The popular dish seemed to be the Shanghai fried buns, but although the meat and soup inside was flavorful, I find the dough a little too soft - had better versions of this elsewhere. The star of the show was surprisingly the fried egg with yellow chives. It doesn't look like much, but the egg was fluffy with many layers, full of umami and the earthiness of the yellow chives just gave it that perfect bite. The other surprise was the stir fried french beans - not oily at all, each bite juicy with a spicy kick. The chicken noodles were springy and nice, and the xiao long baos were okay. Would be back to taste the rest of the dishes. Packed on a wednesday afternoon for lunch. Note, they only accept cash - and call to reserve in advance."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbDdlQk93EAE,Shanghai Renjia,5,"Cozy place where you can get authentic Shanghainese food!

梅菜扣肉包($2.50 each), 春卷 ($6) and 醉鸡 ($10) are must try on the menu! 梅菜扣肉 was nicely done, the pork belly was really soft and tender. Dip the fluffy bun into the sauce for a greater gastronomical experience! The crispy 春卷 and its flavourful filling goes perfectly well with vinegar. 醉鸡 was very juicy and there’s a lightly gelatinous feel to it. You can taste the booziness of the 花雕酒, definitely better than DTF’s version!

We pre-ordered 生煎包 ($6) when making our reservation. Bite with caution as the scalding soup bursts right through the bun. My family loved it but I guess I just don’t enjoy pan fried buns that much.

We also tried 上海小馄饨 ($3.50), my to-go breakfast when I’m in Shanghai. I absolutely loved it, even though it’s just wanton soup to most people.

小笼包($6), a tad bit saltier than DTF’s, but more flavourful with a more chewy skin. I liked it and thought it was better than DTF’s, albeit sadly, there’s no ginger slices to go with it.

Ended the dinner with 南瓜饼 ($2.50 each) and 酒酿丸子($3). Loved the chewy 南瓜饼 that had red bean fillings.

酒酿丸子 really fell short of expectations, cos my grandma used to make this at home. The glutinous rice ball was great (I love all mochis) but the rice wine was too diluted hence resulting in a watery rice wine soup. Could be better if it were more starchy and add more rice wine.

Overall still a great dinner and I’ll be back to try the noodles next time!"

We decided to try this restaurant recommended by ieatipostishoot. Celebrating my wife's birthday, we dined in with a large family but items offered on the menu were mostly ""appetiser"" size and the mains option were only beef noodles and pork chop noodles serving portion for 1 pax, there are no large family size servings options.

When we arrived the staff was rude and asked to shift our seats to make way for their robot server when our seats were already very cramp together.

The portion of dishes were pathetically small and expensive.

Braised pork slices with bun were very thinly sliced.

The Pork Chop noodle taste like dry instant noodle.

The beef noodle only have 3 small piece of meat. Definitely not worth $10 per bowl.

Fried Spring rolls were very very oily.

Steam Xiao Long Bao is quite nice and juicy but no ginger served with vinegar sauce.

No chilli sauce serve in this restaurant.

Not long after our meal we were asked to settle our bill and leave because there was another later reservation.

Overall very poor food quality and poor customer service experience for our family.

Definitely won't go back there again."

Place - this place is very small with around 4 tables, each table can sit 2-3 comfortably or squeeze 4 to 5 pax but not recommended. Looks relatively dated, nothing to look forward with nice or decent ambiance for the likes of mini restaurant.

Food - nothing to look forward, noodles are just cooked with some sauce, nothing flavourful. Xiao long bao is worse than those you ordered at kopitiam.

Price - fairly affordable considering its a mini restaurant below public housing HDB, nowhere close to any amenities. Do note they accept Cash only, no cards or QR payments.

There are hardly more than 8 tables in there and do be sure to call and make a reservation before heading down. They are almost certain to be fully packed everytime i go over without a reservation. They serve really solid la mian, xiao long baos and sheng jian baos (favourite). For a small restaurant, i think the items in the menu is just sufficient for them to run the store efficiently without giving much choices to diners.

in my opinion, i love the XLBs here more than other stores. Only issue with the XLB here is that the skin have not achieve the standard of DTF type. But i feel that the meat and soup within is better than DTF which makes it a must visit place for me. The sheng jian bao here is well done, not oily and the stuffing is very season and marinated.

Definitely will be back to visit."

Love their beef soup noodles too.

As for service, it's a hit and miss depending on how busy they are. Yesterday when I was there some lady in the kitchen was scolding someone else at the top of her lungs for a good 30mins stretch, so if you can enjoy good food and block out tension vibes it's totally worth it!

One wrong order was we wanted stirfry wild yam but came egg with chives which was nice. Not a fan of the mei Cai kou rou ( the taste and pork abit dry) but the lotus bun had very fine texture. Noodles texture was good, taste of the chicken one is better than the pork as the 2nd was abit bland. The braised beef noodle broth is very tomataey.The pan fried bao bottom was overdone so was too hard but filling was good. Wantons are just ok. The stir fry french beans looked so pathetic with small portions and just pure bean. XLB is not too good, felt that the wrapper was too chewy and the filling too little to taste.

Will definately be back but we need to come only when we have 1.5hr as the wait can be pretty long during lunch time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb3VpRFJBEAE,Shanghai Renjia,5,"Here is my honest review useful to you:
I visited for the first time with much apprehension. I read the recent reviews of this place, and was quite afraid that the bad reviews were true. I felt uncertain but decided to take the risk at the end.

I booked in advance for a table, and I pre-ordered the famous Sheng Jian Bao (basically Xiao Long Bao but fried).

I entered the shop to a welcoming boss. Seated, and looked at the menu. The menu is very limited especially for a China mainland-hailing restaurant. These types useually have very large menus.

This is my opinion regarding the limited menu. I actually like it because it tends towards quality dining, fine dining. What do I mean? Simple, the harder it is to make dishes, the more effort it takes, the smaller the menu offered by the chef. Commonsense. So, I hope none of you ugly customers criticise them for this point. Menu is limited, but so what? Every dish is lovingly made. Many dishes are handmade.

I ordered quite a number of different dishes. Probably about 25% of the entire menu.

Here is my general comment on the food. How was it? Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. The noodles were handmade, and no, I am not just telling you it is handmade just because the menu says so. I can see and taste that the noodles are handmade. The shape, the non-uniformness, the springiness, the body, the texture. Handmade noodles.

The vegetables were cooked simply in fragrant oil. Excellent. Definitely novel to the usual ""HK Kai Lan"" or ""Spinach in Oyster Sauce"" in zichar stalls/chinese restaurants.

The Xiao Long Bao was good enough to rival Din Tai Fung.

But the main star of the show was the Sheng Jian Bao. I will not go into detail. All I will say is that it had taste and bite to it. It isn't just xiao long bao wrapped in a different-shaped bao. It is more than that. A Bao in its own right.

The red bean bun dessert was a very good finisher to an excellent chinese meal. Sweet but not too sweet. Very chewy bun.

I may not have described every dish to you, but I want to end off by telling you that from what I have tried, I can tell that this is a quality over quantity place.

Some commentators complain that the portions are too small. I say this: the prices are small too. Definitely cheaper than eating dim sum in expensive hotel chinese restaurants. If you think the portion is small, order more than 1 serving. Very simple. Very, very simple. There is quality in their dishes. Handmade noodles and handmade baos require a lot of labour effort, labour hours. You think they buy their Bao skin from a distributor then wrap meat inside? Of course they have to knead the dough, flatten it, cut it into small circles, and wrap meat and veg inside. Wake up, Singaporeans. You expect to pay cheaply for a lot of Baos?

Some commentators complain that the service is slow. I say this: it is run by a very slim crew. Their food is quality. You expect crazy, big-chain, 20-man kitchen to churn out your food? The consolation is that they serve your dishes once or twice every 10mins. So it is actually okay. It takes a long while for every dish to come out, but at least it keeps coming. They dont do one table by one table from what I observed.

Some commentators complain that the boss shows favouritism. I say this: You dont? I thought most of you are chinese too? ""Ka Ki Lang""? ""Guan Xi""?  So what if the boss likes to chat with regulars, and laughs with them? So what?

Finally, they serve free flow chrysanthemum tea. You can see the yellow flower petals in the jar served to you.

Amazing. Yes, the best chinese restaurant I have gone to. I think of the expensive, grand chinese restaurants.... you know what? They're different. Hard to compare. But this place doesnt lose out on taste at all. Not at all.

I wish them the best. I can tell they just want a humble, simple, quite life in this AMK enclave.

As for you, make sure you call well in advance to book your table and your Sheng Jian Bao. Simple. Ignore all the rubbish comments here from ugly Singaporeans. Call, book, then, go, and eat. Very simple."

I visit 3 years ago still can give it a try when I visit again with my family on July 2022 but as I return to this restaurant found that still no change no sell rice. Foods portion too small and expensive $130 for 4 pax. If you are big eater don't go try. If not you can give it a try. Boss and waitress not so friendly only choose guest to talk.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ci12N1NREAE,Shanghai Renjia,1,"I seldom come across food this bad, but when I do, I feel responsible to the public to post this.

Service staff were impatient and inattentive from the start - rushed and missing orders, tea not refilled, internal conflict among staff

Food was bad and expensive for the portion sizes - vegetarian luo han was nothing more than a pile of canned mushrooms in oyster/soy sauce (?!!!), sheng jian bao skin was tough and doughy, wild steam shoots which was supposed to come with meat was a sad puddle of withered shoots in muddy gravy with not a single strand of meat in sight. The best part - they don’t serve rice or ginger (for their xiao long Bao). Which Chinese restaurant doesn’t serve rice??

This is a far cry from the 4.0 review that is stated on Google and other review platforms. Not sure if the owners/chefs had given up on life.

Please do NOT make a trip to this restaurant. Even if you’re in the area or happen to live around here, you’re better off eating instant noodles. An utter disgrace to Shanghai/Chinese cuisine 🙅‍♂️

(NB - they should seriously consider redirecting their investment in the service robot to serving better food. Or at least try.)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3M3V2lnRRAB,Shanghai Renjia,1,"Poor customer service, the elderly women serving the food has a frustrated look on her face all times, super unwelcoming, when asked questions, she just turned her head and walked away, not replying to my question

Super long waiting hour, took 30 minutes for a table and then 1h30mins more for them to finally serve all the food, the Shengjian Bao and Tangyuan took the longest and wasnt even that nice. I am very disappointed upon the fact that they have a 4 star review but it was one of the worst restaurant i have ever been to

Bad food quality, the Shengjian Bao we waited for the longest was as hard as a rock half of it was soft half of it was hard, there is also not ginger to pair it with the Shengjian Bao and XiaoLong Bao. The vinegar was also diluted.

The price is also expensive for such little food with no quality

I can understand why we needed to take 30 mins just for a table, because they took so long at serving the food, the items on the menu is also so less yet we waited so long just for a simple dish"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLVpDNmNBEAE,Shanghai Renjia,5,"Get the shengjian bao. Best I've had in Singapore. The other foods are totally legit. Menu is small so you can feel free to try everything.

Spring rolls and meicai kourou bao was amazing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGZUM3FBRRAB,Shanghai Renjia,1,"We made a reservation after watching a video review that said the food was better than DTF and what you could get in Shanghai. We ordered xiaolongbao, shengjianbao, kongbabao, pickled cabbage roll, fried pumpkin cake, jiuniangwanzi.

Food was subpar for the price paid. Amount of meat in kongbabao was miserly and thinly sliced. Xiaolongbao and shengjianbao had way too much MSG, so much so that it hit us on the first bite.

You would do much better going to crystal jade or DTF."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycmQtRHNRRRAB,Shanghai Renjia,2,"Server was more interested talking on the phone than serving. Xiao long bao didn't come with ginger and looked like frozen one from supermarket. Noodles suppose to come with chicken or pork chop three pieces came could not tell what it was.

For the love of god please eat somewhere else."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNVl6WHB3RRAB,Shanghai Renjia,2,"This is not the way to do business. the food is quite okay. however the portion size is extremely small, service is incredibly slow and owner turn down walk-in or takeaway based on mood."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaE16ckVnEAE,Shanghai Renjia,3,"Service was slow. Food took some time to arrive. I quite like the noodles but the meat was a bit tough. Xiao long bao was average and it didnt make much of an impression. Fried pork while crispy lack flavour. The pork belly buns are pricey at 2.50 each and I think the ones at paradise is better. The chilled chicken while tasty wasn't worth the $10 for a very small portion. The highlight was the fried buns, those were good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aEp5SElnEAE,Shanghai Renjia,5,"A small unassuming gem of a restaurant quietly hidden in the depths of Ang Mo Kio.

It was a very simple menu, every item was decently priced, and they arrived each was carefully made.

Drunken chicken was delicious. Other yummy things included the pan fried meat dumplings, pumpkin dumplings and Xiao long bao.

Highly recommended.

It’s a small place so book before you go."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVN0tIaWNBEAE,Shanghai Renjia,4,"Nice little Shanghai place, the food is nice. Try the spring veg roll, it’s not like what we eat outside.

The drunken chicken is also nice. And the fried pau is good too. Portion is rather small.

It’s popular, please remember to call and reserve a seat to avoid waiting"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveDRYcGFREAE,Shanghai Renjia,4,"Sunday night dinner at this quaint little restaurant with just a few tables - called last minute and wasnt able to get a table initially but the owner called back to say someone cancelled 😅 lucky haha

Food was pretty good: pork chop noodles were decent but the flavour lacked depth. The chicken and mushrooms noodles were better with the taste of ginger cutting through the sweetness of the mushroom and soy sauce. The cold drunken chicken was yummy and tender while the xiaolongbao’s soup was very flavorful!

All in all pretty decent food, price in the mid ranges at $68 for 4 people"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcHE2M0J3EAE,Shanghai Renjia,3,"Small little restaurant with only 7 tables
Hidden at a corner of a HDB block.
Reservation is a must
Food is home cook style nothing special
Some of the fryed dishes are abit oily
Come in small portion
Prices are slightly high
Worth to try are the pumpkin ball, xiao long bao, shen jian bao and popiah
Cash terms only
Aunty serving got alittle attitude problem
Plenty of parking lots right behind the block."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnJhaUlREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"The Deep fried prawn ball with pumpkin and butter sauce was the best and most yummy dish! I’m still missing it 🥲

Pork belly meat was tender and soft too.

Overall value for money as all the dishes we ordered were delicious. The meal was made even better as we ordered deep fried baby squid which is uncommonly found these days at Zi char places, a dish we rarely get to eat.

Will be back for more! 👍🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDa2VLU0pREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"It in a coffee shop. Smoking area is causing the air to feel polluted. The food is better then normal zhi char and lots of variety.
They have one of the best deep fried pork belly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eGJuZWtnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"Went for mother day dinner on 7 May 2022 after nearly 2 years of covid restrictions.. enjoyed the food alot 😊

Good zi char place for any occassion. Just finish with early reunion dinner and didnt disappoint 😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MDdfdHZ3RRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"Great food, I particularly love the chicken in herbal soup where you can taste the yummy XO taste,  salted egg black pepper crab that's so milky and buttery and the crispy floss egg plant! Super yummy!!! Also, the service staff were quick, attentive and efficient! They even served us complimentary dessert after dinner, such a pleasure to be having my dinner here!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeXRxNVpREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,1,"slow service, told us 15 mins wait but ended waiting 45 mins for just 3 dishes. kankong was ok, white beehoon was bland. we came here to eat the baby squid which we had before, but sadly the standard dropped, small portion and relatively hard to chew. smoking area in coffee shop made the wait v unpleasant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDd2R1LURnEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Came for their perennial fav Dong Po Rou (Braised Pork Belly). Still as yummy as I rem. Good sauce with the pork which isn't gamey too. But the sambal kangkong was pretty pedestrain. Spent $24 for 2 pax.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnLU9EYWdBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"Food: great tasting dishes throughout. What really hit the spot was the pumpkin prawns dish and Dong Bo pork belly. I’d definitely order it again. On top of regular zi char dishes, they also do interesting ones like black currant ribs, chrysanthemum fried fish.

Ambience: kopitiam Zi char stall lor.

Price: reasonable. Sure, there are cheaper Zi char places, but if you value quality, I’m sure you won’t regret forking out a little extra.

with so many other interesting dishes to chow on, I’m looking forward to my next visit!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOV9uTmh3RRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Good food at affordable prices. Already crowded on a normal weekday. Ample parking in front of coffee shop.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnLXRqWjhnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZc3JpVEhREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"Kam Jia Zhuang is our family ta pao Zhi char place to go. It’s convenient Cus all we do is to call them up, ask them for specials of the day, pack and we pick it up. Place is usually packed on Saturdays. Value for money zhi char. Highly recommended dish : SEAFOOD CRABS with black pepper. Other zhi char dishes include prawnball with pumpkin sauce, lemon chicken, lala bee hoon ( very good) and Ha Cheong Kai ( Fried chicken wings ). Do give it a try. 🐼🐼🤪❤️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJbFlUQXJnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,3,"Ok.. this is decent.. not stellar.. it's not a destination for cze char (for our family) .. great if it's downstairs your apartment. Contrary to some other comments - we enjoyed the 招牌 beehoon the most, pork ribs, prawns, eggs, and vege were all average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdU9qdU1nEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,1,"i stay few blocks away and i eat quite often. recently, the standard has dropped a lot. dont deserve to be top zi char list. maybe they have changed the chef, but the taste is not up to standard. sweet and sour pork may not be their signature but is a common dish, i was disappointed that the meat is terribly small, meaning you eat more flour. the sauce for black pepper pork chop is diluted as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z0lxc0x3EAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Sweet and Sour Pork Rib rice with egg. Taste good too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnM05PcHJnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,2,It's a neighbourhood zi char restaurant that doesn't really stand out despite the reviews. I tried the special bee hoon and imperial pork chop rice. Special bee hoon attempted to be like white bee hoon (sembawang?) but doesn't quite make it. It's not bad but not special. Prawns were bland. Pork chop was dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor. Rice was hard and dry. OK for a neighbourhood zi char but not worth traveling for.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcDczdFJREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Tasty food at reasonable prices. Do try the fried fish with mango sauce
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdF9yWVFBEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Awesome. Food was all good though a bit of over fry / burn in the Har jiong chicken wings. Every dish was well put together. Special mention to the spicy chrysanthemum fish dish. Service was good and very accommodating to our requests. Awesome.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna1pYSE5nEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Food was great. Recommended to book in advance. Really enjoyed their signature prawns.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MllDV2t3RRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Food tastes good. A different kind of butter taste for prawn and different kind of sweet and sour pork taste for the rib pork.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dFp5S1V3EAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"Above average zi char, not spectacular. Price are 10%-15% higher than your neighbourhood zi char. Have been eating here since young, and still having it often. If u stay in jurong or changi, not worth travelling down tbh. I personally love the sambal fried rice, give it a go!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMUpTMjhnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,3,Prawn was great. ribs were so-so. noodles were OK.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaDZtOUJnEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Amazing seafood at affordable prices. Do pre-order your black pepper and chilli crab!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NUxqVG9RRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Serving good Tze Char dishes. Need to go earlier to avoid the queues.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZMHVfODVnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,I like the Zi Char they served here. Its above average. It's get crowded over the weekend. Call to reserve a table if u can.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOFlTbW5BRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"For a zichar, its really good. The sambal chilli there is flavourful! We had the sambal kangkong, very tasty. The deep fried pork cutlet was really good too. The fried seafood egg was like any other egg elsewhere, nothing special but still good. The pumpkin butter prawn didn't have much pumpkin, but the prawn was fresh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMkxxa1JREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,2,"2nd visit here. First visit was good. But this time, not so.

Reached around 6.45pm and was told the wait will be 30 to 40 mins, which we are fine. After 40mins, one fried chicken was brought out and rice. With each dish coming out every 10mins, need 1 over hour for all dishes to be out at 8pm.

Food is good however it's taking too long for hungry diners.

P.s. Another table came later than us but got our their food earlier."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNak0zMEpREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Made famous by an exposure on TV. Their culinary skills are not too bad and  the family had served the neighbours over the decade if not more. Prices are fair and there are ample parking. But prepare to wait on weekend dinners.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaEpmT2lRRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Love the Fry bee hoon! Delicious!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcnVlTWl3RRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"Tasty sweet and sour pork, well plated too 👌"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPODZTVkp3EAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,1,"U do not deserve any good review

Irresponsible zi char stall 😑😑😑"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNHBERkJREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"Definitely a good place for good Zhichar specials!  Why specials?  This family-managed business has absolutely what almost every food hunter would like to find and taste.  Good price,  ample parking lots,  good food,  friendliness,  special chef recommendations although most times have to wait.  With good food waiting is fine isn't it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMTZ2LWtnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,3,Tried their new year set dinner. Taste and freshness were good but the serving was so small it was almost funny at times. Not that affordably priced considering the serving size. The food was served extremely slowly too making the entire dining experience disappointing. The deep fried brinjal w pork floss (not part of the set) was good though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LTktYWxnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,"Value for money, superb food even with takeaway.  Ordered again for mums birthday and always good so far."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN3JiTE5REAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,1,The food are getting more and more expensive. It cost $5.60 to dabao a packet of Hor Fun. Also the portion has become much smaller too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNUo2NktREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,3,"Crab: Fresh but salted egg yolk sauce was not up to mark because it tasted diluted.

Prawn paste chicken: batter wasn’t crispy and the taste of the chicken wasn’t strong.

3 eggs spinach: Diluted and mild taste of the 3 types of eggs.

Enoki with tofu: I don’t taste the soya in the tofu.

I expected more as I thought it was famous.

Not a big crowd on a weekend night. It was fairly manageable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eTVpVktREAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,My friends and I loved the quality of the zichar food. Great food and wallet friendly. Remember to try the signature dishes. We will be back again!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNrNGFLNDNBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Decent tze char with lovely signature food and slow braised pork belly
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0LUtpeHNRRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Food is good & price is reasonable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbWJHSXlBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"Came here because of Food King. We ordered Dong Po Pork Belly, fried fish with chrysanthemum sauce and the pumpkin prawn balls. They were all good, huge portions but not fantastic. With the family crowd on that Saturday we went, you know this zhi char has a certain standard that they won't fall below. But food-king good? Hmm probably not."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbllPSmd3RRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Great tze char dishes to be found here. Prices are decent although it can be steep for some of the dishes. Family loves the food here. Two thumbs up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndl9fUlh3EAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,Pretty good tze char in the neighborhood. Taste great at good price. I will definitely come back for more even though im staying in sengkang. Will like to try the fish head steamboat. One of their specialty is the blackcurrant rib... Which is like sweet sour pork + pork rib king... Not bad
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRa01QNS1BRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,Big n succulent pumpkin prawns! Pumpkin sauce is so flavourful you will want to ask for more. Best ribs I've had! Marinated in Ribena for 4hrs and then fried and coated w a mysteriously tasty sauce. The oomph will haunt you until you get your next fix. Do remember to make a reservation or you may have to expect to be turned away. Don't wait! Make your reservation now!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX19xLTdnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"This is considered out of the way although a short walk from the MRT station. Luckily we decided on a late night dinner instead reaching at 9:30pm on a Fri night. Even then we can still see the remnants of the dinner crowd so would advice those who want to eat in peace and not wait too long to go before or after the peak hours.

We only ordered 3 dishes and all 3 feels quite solid. The drunken chicken soup was tasty and full of Chinese herbs. Both my dad and mum can make better soups but this is as good as it gets when you are eating out.

We had the egg omelette whilst pretty normal for tze char was done pretty well. The egg was not rubbery, and one can get a good bite from the other ingredients egged into it.

The pumpkin sauced prawns were the highlight we think of the dinner. One may be lulled into thinking this is a healthier version of salted-egg yolk sauces. I rather think this is a deconstruction of what is common place with something else surprising. The creamy feel of the sauce when one bites into the prawns is eyebrow lifting to say the least. And I can't help but wonder what is added to replicate the salted egg yolk but not kinda taste.

Overall is definitely a place worth checking out, if you have the time and patience to travel all the way (remember how crappy the red line is right now). The food will reward you for your trouble.

Though on 2nd thought, there is always this naggy feeling that the tze char store is as good as the chef is. And no chef and his team is permanent. If anything, I would savor the experience until the next discovery."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndmVYQTNBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,First time trying this stall after searching google. Turns out to be quite good despite the fact that we bought take away. I believe it will taste even better if we were to eat there. Food portion was ok and not too small. Will be back again to try eating there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN1BiWmhnRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,5,A good budget Zhi char and quite environment.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbVlPNjdBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"First time here, fish head curry, it is $24 but pretty tasty. Brinjal and okra is cooked through. The tomato tasted a little weird. The tofu with enoki dish is pretty good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDenBXQWlBRRAB,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,1,"We made reservations. When we arrived, the waitress directed us to share a table w a stranger. Is that allowed? Perhaps the boss or even MOH should look into this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRZzk3ZkFnEAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,"Overall above average. Good food, reasonable price, lots of parking, walking distance from amk mrt. But crowded place and long waiting time. It’s better to make reservation by calling them if your group is more than 4. Will come back for this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cmRYTE1REAE,Kam Jia Zhuang Seafood,4,It's a nice che zhar stall in the neighborhood of Ang Mo Kio avenue 3. Price is very reasonable and taste good.  You can call for reservation or go early if you don't want to wait for the table.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd2FYdEtREAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"Tim Sum variety remains but the quality had definitely dropped, but taste is still consider ok for a neighbourhood Tim Sum.

The only thing that need improvement is the cleanliness as tables are always sticky as I could tell that the table cloth is hardly rinsed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazlmQXlRRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"my family was being blessed by a sumptuous breakfast as the household members were down with covid. it was a really nice meal, especially the char siew puff that taste amazing!! the porridge comes with a lot of ingredients and it’s tasty. service is extremely good too. my friend mentioned that she asked for a change of item and called them up they were so nice to help. highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2RDRFFBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"June 2022: came for dinner to satisfy dim sum craving for dinner. Had a few long only cos we were not that hungry. It’s part of a coffeeshop and not fancy at all. Food was ok, not as tasty as those hotel level dim sum, but better than the typical coffee shop dim sum stalls. Stall owner had great service too. Even selected a few videos for us to view while we were having dinner. Maybe cause we were seated at table 2 - right in front of the big screen. We thought all the dishes were actually tasty. I liked the Paper wrapped chicken the best! Good choice for dim sum dinner near home."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejR5MHh3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"Had a wide variety of satisfying dim sum at this place.  I have to say that generally it was quite enjoyable though the standards were uneven.  For example, while the Chee cheong fun and the char siew pau, char siew seu and har kau were well done, the potstickers were done with too thick a skin and the egg custard buns didn't exactly ooze with goodness.  Nonetheless you get what you paid for and you would have an okay experienxd if you choose the right dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNU5LdzJRRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"Very decent, humble tasting dim sum. Wide selection and for the price, it is well worth. The chee cheong fun is a must, with its preserved vegetable and lard garnish. Very authentic. The har gao is our least favourite; sufficient prawn meat, but the skin was slightly mushy and more fragile than usual."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z3FxdENBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,"Liu sha bao ($4.50) that doesn't liu. Imagine my disappointment when i bit into the bao to see solid bits... but the liu sha does taste great! Only pity is that it's too small.

Menu doesn't indicate price so it is inconvenient to make payment. The staff took my order while standing far inside the stall. She shouted the price $4.5 but somehow i interpreted as $3.8 and made the payment on Grabpay. It was only few minutes after my payment that she walked over to where I was sitting to tell me that i underpaid. She also didn't validate at my point of payment. Stall owner should consider indicating the price on menu."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMTdyU1JnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"The quality of the dim sum is so so
Rude stall assistant gives it a negative impression. Porridge taste very plain. The rest of the dimsum taste is very heavy on the gravy. The only upside is that they have many varieties. Price wise is not worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN2J2NVZ3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,Traditional Hong Kong dim sum to satisfy all your circuit breaker craving! Definitely taste better than the looks. Easy ordering online for pick-up.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cGJxNk1nEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,2,"Average and not worth the queue and your calories. All the dim sum just too salty and the porridge is tasteless.

Go try next door fishball noodle as it seems taste better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdE9iVEVBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"The queue is always long and that gave me the impression of 5 star food but I would give this place 3.5 stars! There are hits and misses as is the case with almost, if not every restaurant. I find the seasonings of most of their dishes spot on even if some of the dim sum did not make the cut for me. I liked their siu mai, har gow, prawn fritter (明角虾) the best. The rice noodle roll was not bad although I would prefer a thinner sheet. The taro balls would have gotten my thumbs up had the taro's texture been more ""powdery"" and less dense. I should not compare but I always use Crystal Jade's egg tart as benchmark for flaky Chinese egg tarts. Lo Mai Gai is a must order whenever I have dim sum and although the sticky rice was soft enough, the overall dish did not excite. The kopitiam had decent Kopi peng and Teh-C peng."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwblBpaDV3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,No frills. Not fantastic. Self service. Quite speedy although Coffeeshop was packed full during meal times. Not going to be winning any foodie awards. A rather wide variety available. Very decent dim sum for the price.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajhYaEZBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,All their steamed stuff like xiao long bao and cheecheong fan had v thick skin which im not a fan of. But the prawn beancurd deep fried dish was da bomb. Best in SG i’ve tried. Generally v flavourful.

Missed those good old day at The Neptune Theatre Restaurant was a well-known restaurant and theatre in Singapore that was in business from the 1970s to 2006. Housed in the Overseas Union House at Collyer Quay, Neptune was famous for hosting topless revues and large-scale dinners. During the day, the restaurant served Cantonese dim sum fare that was popular with the office workers in the area. (Text taken from inforpedia. ) 🧊🧊🧊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNmM3S3hRRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"The food was much better before. Still, for the price and the range of dim sum they offered, worth a visit if you are in the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMktEU3RRRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"Reasonable price but dim sum is average, except for bbq pork pau which is quite tasty. Lotus leaf glutinous rice tastes bland and hard, probably need longer steaming time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwOUxUejBnRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"A dim sum place that is near home. The variety is not bad with many of the dum sum dishes to be available. However, the taste is just normal street standard. No crowd at 10am on Friday morning, pretty relaxing for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnaTQ3d0dBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"My favourite dim sum place in SG. Love the red bean pancake. It's the best I've tried and a must-order (a little oily but I can live with that). Also the crispy mango prawn roll is quite nice as well. Would have given it 5 star but the char siew pao tasted a bit stale today... Nevertheless, one of the best places to go if you are craving for dim sum 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MWFIaGd3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,This dim sum is worth more than a 3 star. Always have a lot ppl especially on weekends. Usually will be full house on weekends as early as 9am.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJd01QNDdBRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"First time at this coffee shop restaurant over Sunday morning. The food was nice and reasonably priced. Waiting time was rather short estimated abt 10 minutes, contrary to some who complained abt the long wait?!
My family and I were satisfied with the food and the service. Definitely a gem in the neighborhood where you keep seeing people joining the queue. Will come back again for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaWFySU9nEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,Long que but poor taste..  Restaurant pricing but at poor food quality...!!  Chee chong fun skin was so thick.. Fried stuff was too saltty..  Har kaw skin was too thick too !!..  It was a total disappointment... Porridge quality was acceptable.. Pricing is way too high.. Damage $75..!! .. Liu sao bun is not watery but with solid yellow hardened paste!...  Just disappointment..!!  Avoid if can!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0LUxfVFl3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,There are variety of dim sum to choose from. The usual time to wait for the steaming time and served. Skin of the dim sum is think and taste good from the inner content.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcE1MMURnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"Not bad food, though service kinda confusing coz they might not be the most meticulous in ensuring what they have served out tallied with what we ordered.
Place kinda warm coz outdoor eating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeEtiUUdnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,"Was happening to view my archive picture and decided to post about this.
First of all, queue is long. Waiting time is long. Staff on duty was kind of rude
When it’s my turn, the auntie was communicating with me in other language Cantonese and Chi? Ask what is she promoting me for the new dish, she reply in Cantonese which I don’t uds. I tot why not just try lo.

End up I’m getting 1 slice of abalone that cost me $10. Really not worth the try"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc1BxTUxBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,2,"Food is not so nice. The guo tie wrapper was thick and the filling was dry. The egg tart custard was jiggly and tasty, but the pasty was somewhat soggy. The rice rolls were so thick, it was like eating chunks of steamed rice flour. The steamed chicken feet were good though.
This stall should indicate their prices clearly, either on the display or on the menu. We only got to find out the prices at the point of ordering."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzenRpZnh3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"spent $19 ,  not cheap nor expensive.. but yummy.
there have BLACK vinegar with sliced ginger, sign of bone fide tim sum purveyor"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVamEtQ0ZnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,"Ordered a truck load of food. Had to wait quite awhile to que cause of the crowd. Recommended to go early.
1st batch of Siew mai was raw, informed them and they did a quick swap. Turned out great!
Har gow had super plump prawns, super worth it.
Best dish was the steam black bean pork rib.
It's at a coffee shop, recommended to sit outside, away from the zichar stall if not you'll be perspiring like we did."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRaXVHbDFnRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,"Queue: When I first reached at 10.30am, there was a queue. However, when I left there wasn't any queue.
Food: Good amount of varieties. The quality and taste of the food is average for me, not bad but not exceptionally nice.
Price: My family ordered 12 dim sum, 1 porridge, and 1 rice, for $53.00. Not too expensive but neither very cheap/affordable.

UPDATE: Went again this morning. Maybe because it was early in the morning and there was not a lot of customers, when my aunt went to order she was pressured by the staff into ordering additional items.
This is what I considered bad service. I never like the idea of being push into buying."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxemM2WHJBRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"Food is good, handmade! Better then the huge chain around Singapore with gold in the name. Staff is friendly too! Unfortunately I don't live near to eat it often."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjd0oyb0VREAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,Food there was delicious but a little salty to my preference. Tried to order take away frozen dim sum from them for breakfast for my family but seems like is still the best to eat there as the frozen dim sum which we ordered wasn’t as good.  Their best dish is giant har gow and lotus rice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbF9mcExREAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,Ok ok lah. Whilst fried stuff was decent the rest was so so incl Char siew sou. The century egg porridge was a big disappointment. And service was so so..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3NVBHX0V3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,2,"Summary: For the price-to-quality and long wait, go somewhere else.

The good: The food was of decent quality and the shrimp chee cheong fun had quite a lot of prawns in it. The average price of each dish is about $3.50, which is par for the course at a dim sum experience.

The bad: Despite the price, it isn't a full dim sum experience never it isn't a restaurant, but charges the same price. The operations are messed up with a lot of inefficiencies, leading to the customer collecting their food in bits and pieces (you need to collect it yourself - again less than a dim restaurant experience, where they deliver to your table) and the wait can be very long, depending on the dish - I had to wait for about an hour for the freshly fried red bean pancake! By then I wasn't hungry and lost eating momentum - I would have rather they didn't offer it at all if I knew I had to wait that long."

3rd visit

Quality is dropping with every visit...started out really good that we went for twice consecutive weekend.

However it's still really crowded with the another wanton stor holding the fort. Hence expect to wait for 20 min or more if you have a group of 4 and more.

Overall it's still offer affordable price for a neighbourhood dimsum"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0OHBDdlZnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,Pretty lackluster but still edible. You probably have other better choices in this coffeeshop unless you are craving for some dim sum
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOFByMGNBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,Nice solid value for money dim sum. Not the most refined but it's comfort food like what I've been used to. Nothing less. Will visit regularly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHBhR0JREAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"Decently priced, decent service. Came here in the afternoon so it was really hot. Liu sha bao and chee cheong fun were great; xiu mai and xlb were not so."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMTkyR2p3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,2,"Variety of choice yes, price is considerably cheap compared to other neighborhoods dimsum including 1.30 dimsum. But overall food is below average, would rate 4.5 / 10 max."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbnN5N3B3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,Nothing fancy. Just your regular neighbour dim sum. Not bad either.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3Z0xqMEhREAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,Nice place for tim sum in hong kong style. Lots of varieties and freshly made from steam to fried stuffs. Love the congee too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOExTNGJnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,"You can tell easily from the rude stall assistant auntie and unpalatable food. Moments of cooking so cack handed and unprofessional, that I want to congratulate the stall on its incompetence."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbV83Q19BRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,3,If I stay nearby I will not mind having dim sum there.  Chicken feet is nice but a bit on the pricey side given that is a coffeshop setting. liusha pau was not too bad and the price was OK.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4cHR5SVBnEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"I don't have much choices in Singapore to compare with but I think the taste is good and the price is reasonable. Its a more friendly budget version of YumCha. The food that I ordered here cost around $26.90 for 2 person. I am happy with that as my brunch. =)
Probably due to Covid-19, the space its kinda limited and of coz it's food court place so don't expect it to be comfortable and airconditioned environment but it's rather cozy and windy.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLXB1eS1BRRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,The food is quite good. Better than canto paradise.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOEluYVR3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"Taste quite authentic Malaysian style dim sum.
Particularly like the yong tou foo which reminds me of old days 😋 though a bit pricy ($1/piece in average)
Char Siew bun and Egg Tarts are nice too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdDZ1Y0J3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,"Its a pretty good Dim Sum place that isnt Swee Choon! Their baked goods are the best the bbq pork puff if I remember the name right. Only thing is queues are long, and there isnt much seats, and today was fine. But before Covid, the queues to get food and finding a seat is long! Be prepared!  But worth it~"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcWZ1WDd3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,5,"Dim sum is delicious! Wanted to visit the shanghai restaurant next door but they were full so we settled for this instead. Got to give a good review because everything we ordered was surprisingly good. Radish cake was smooth, siew mai was juicy and liu sha bao was runny. Good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbEx6QlZ3EAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,4,Delicious! A wide selection and affordable. Egg tarts and char siew sow are nice.  Siew mai har gow are delectable.. only the steamed pork ribs falls short a little.. affable cashier despite the long queue.. however the queue seems to be shorter than the fishball queue next to it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3JhVTJ3RRAB,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,1,Asked for more mayo on my youtiao and he squeezed the whole mayo OVER my whole plate with my spring rolls. Eh trying to be funny???? Who eats spring roll with mayo?? Problematic!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbFk2cFJBEAE,Kow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum,2,"The food is alright, pricey.. but alright. My biggest concern with this stall was the rude young man at the counter. Now I don’t expect great customer service, but neither do I expect to be treated so rudely. The gestures the young man used to rush you to return the buzzer, and the manner in which he returns you your change, it’s as though he’s angry at you for something or you owe it to him..? It really does spoil your mood when food is supposed to bring you joy, so no thanks, I’m not heading back there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGJpVlFREAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Second visit. Food is nice and the less salty/oil makes the dishes we ordered seems more healthy. The fish maw soup comes full of fish maw and other ingredients. The fried baby squids are crispy. The chicken wrapped in cabbage is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGJfS25nRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Ordered A Couple Of Times Thru Home Delivery, For Special Occasion.  I Must Say Food Always Delivered Promptly Within Selected Time Slot. My Family Love The Food Esp Lobster Porridge. Other Dishes Were Good Too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaU55c2VREAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Cold plate was very generous in portion . 东坡肉 was ok flavour is there tender and nice. The 麦片下 was dry and blend shouldn’t order the one without shell. 菜包鸡 was acceptable but I feel the chicken inside was lack of flavour and abit bland have to go with the sauce to taste . I love the 2 wok fried vegetable .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb09lVXVBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Best tze char restaurant around … ordered their red grouper… meat for fish porridge and bone for stir fly bitter gourd with fish bone..orn ni (Yam Paste) is another must eat..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaWN1cldREAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Food is quite good but service can be further improved. Price is very reasonable but the waiting time can be very long.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNWR5X3B3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this meal - the salted egg crab became the best crab I have tasted (replacing the butter crab from Melben), and I expected the lobster porridge to be bland or full of MSG, but instead got hit by this umami bomb of seafood sweetness. Crab - plump and sweet, with a sauce chock full of salted egg and surprisingly light. Lobster porridge - the star is the stock - seafood sweetness that is just the right balance of sweetness, saltiness and umami - drank two bowls and no MSG reaction at all. I will definitely be back for this gem tucked in the middle of nowhere

Update: went back on a Monday and the crab was still good (a little less salted egg taste), and the lobster porridge broth was so dilute - tastes like corn more than lobster…and the lobster was slightly overcooked. The most disappointing dish was the hk steamed grouper - $50 but it was frozen dry overcooked fish.

I decreased this rating to three stars due to the hit and miss of the dishes, and the inconsistency."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0lMQ3lnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Lobster porridge was the highlight; the porridge and the broth was rich and flavorful, but the lobster itself was lackluster at best. Other dishes ordered tasted great too. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDLVlmR0pBEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,The signature items are really worth a try and tastes great! It's right beside a public carpark which might be a little difficult to find space during dinner time. Must order the cabbage chicken which is sold in limited amounts daily as well as the toufu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNd3B1aWlnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Good airconditioned zi char place. We had the set for 10. It included the lobster porridge in claypot with the lobster served separately (a very tasty and yummy one), cabbage chicken in claypot, steam grouper Hong Kong style, scallops with broccoli, tofu with enoki mushrooms and puay ling vegetables, smoked duck with jellyfish, braised abalone with mushrooms and sea cucumber, and orh ni for dessert. I didn't eat the abalone dish as it came out just before the dessert and I was way too full for it. Should have served the dish earlier. My 2 favourites were the lobster porridge and the tofu dish. Price was reasonable, service was great. Very attentive service staff. The place was clean but could have been more comfortable if the air-con was functioning properly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHU3MXJBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Staff are candid in their recommendations. Food are tasty, even the old folks like it. I guess they have the 古老味，reminiscing the old style zhi char taste I am used to in my childhood."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bWVGMBAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Chui Xiang has much to offer.
Food without MSG.
Selected decent pricing dishes (eg whole soon hock fish around $20, white pepper Sri Lanka crab less than $50).
And most importantly, great cooking!
This is one of the restaurants among Casuarina road that operates for a long time, I attributes it's long standing towards the value and quality of their food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjM2NubHRRRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Order the popular lobster 🦞 porridge and some recommended dishes, very flavourful and the lobster is very fresh.. the oyster 🦪 egg is also nice 👍🏼. Do take note that the place do not have sheltered carpark nearby."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBN3FIUGRnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"One of the best tze char eatery in Spore. Highly recommended 👍👍👍 the must tries are Marmite Pork Chop, Lobster Porridge, Cabbage Chicken, Dong Bo Pork, Sambal French Bean, Fish Maw Soup, Beef Horfun, and many others. Yums...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcjZlektnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Had a yusheng here. It was ok just that it was a bit too dry (not enough sauces). Salted egg fish skin is crispy and tasty. Marmite pork ribs are tender. Tofu with golden mushrooms are nice too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM0pUSTd3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,Pretty average dishes. Nothing special that really stands out. Lots of variety to choice from though. 5 dishes total price at 130 SGD including one pot of chinese tea.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbjd6aXp3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Not your typical zi char restaurant. In addition to the regular dishes, they do a good amount of fresh seafood and the extra ordinary lobster porridge. The deep fried soon hock fish was excellent as well as the salted egg sauce crab. White bee hoon was also very good. Parking in the area may be a bit challenging but well worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNaGJHcTNnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Really nice Zi Char place and pretty affordable too. Would recommend the salted egg sotong and coffee pork ribs! The signature cabbage chicken is interesting and worth trying too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNUpIbVR3EAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Great food at reasonable prices. Highly recommended to try the Prawn Vermicelli and Marmite Pork Ribs.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNM08tNVl3EAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Ordered Cabbage Chicken, Fuyong Omelette, Peppered Salt Fried Cuttlefish and sambal sweet potato leaves. Fuyong Omelette not great, the rest good. Reasonable pricing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdEtpdXV3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"The first time my family patron this restaurant was at Commonwealth Ave.  Though the atmosphere was not as good as some places at that time, this was more than compensated by the reasonable price and nice food.

Most dishes are good, to name a few:
Marmite Pork Ribs, Braised 'Dong Po' Pork, Fish Maw Thick Soup, Cereal Prawn, Salad Fried Prawn, Homemade Toufu with Enoki Mushrooms, Prawn Paste Chicken, etc.

The current location is not as spacious as at Commonwealth and you may need to book especially on weekends. We have and will continue to go to this kitchen at their updated location which is at 126 Casuarina Rd, Singapore 579514"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMmZTd1lnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Usual hang out place for nice food n decent price
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZZ3YyTTdnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Ordered the steamboat - $35.
Fish is extremely fresh, soup is slightly bland but gets sweeter as it simmers with the vegetables. Has yam, tofu, cabbage in the soup as well.

Beef hor fun is great, been here 3 times already and ordered each time. Quality of the dish may vary, not as nice when it’s crowded but it’s very good when it’s less crowded."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4bDgycXJBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,"Ordered cabbage wrapped chicken, marmite pork, French bean with minced meat and pineapple fried rice, for delivery.

The cabbage wrapped chicken is unique and hidden with some chestnuts, wolf berries, etc.
Long cooking made the cabbage soft and disintegrated with a tinge of sour taste.
Overall not bad but the chicken is a little bland.

Marmite pork is disappointing. Marmite taste and flavour is not there.
Maybe due to long delivery time, the pork is soggy but this should not affect the marmite taste though.

Pineapple fried rice is okayish but bland.

Maybe it will taste better and yummier if dine in."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bUltTjVnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Very yummy, reasonable prices. Try the salt / pepper fried squid. Light and tasty and squid was tender. The homemade tofu with enoki mushroom was also a gem.

We came early for dinner (about 545pm) and food was served within 10 mins - very fast!

Recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaGJqUVNBEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Value for money, good food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbUt6dC13RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Beef hot fun with egg sauce was so delicious! Value for money as there is set meal for 6.90  for the big portion of seafood Mee hoon soup and a drink
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNOEt6UnpnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Good food at very reasonable prices and good service too. A recommended place to go for Your celebrations.

Slightly overpriced."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX3BXRVpnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,It's closest to home cooked food that you can find. There is no msg in the food and the taste is genuine. Had their signature lobster porridge. The lobsters are very fresh and the size is around 300gm each so the piece of meat is quite decent. The 3 eggs vege dish is very good and so is stir fried red garouper filler meat. The tofu is really smooth and you can actually taste the bean. Price is very reasonable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTQ3eDlBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,"food here is great but the timing displayed here is a scam. google stated that the store will be opened till 10.30pm on a saturday but arrived and they said they’re closed for the day at 9.30pm (we arrived at 9.15pm) -,-"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MktPdzdBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"The area was located near Old Upper Thomson road, where there were open carparks for parking. Convenience was of concern when we reached there. Service staff were friendly and nice, as we made our reservations through phone. We ordered the 6 persons value set meal together with an extra fried rice for our kids. Food taste were surprisingly tasty and  the portion were huge!. That was a plus point given our first time patronizing the stall. Price wise was a bit on the high side with Service charge and GST imposed, hence a 4 star review for the restaurant. Good to revisit again for the tasty food served."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZc01yTWZREAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,Crowded during the weekend. Not enough staff. Food quality is ok. White Pepper Crab is nice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLWZiaWRnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,I like the second day cny gathering. The booking a week ago for us is 1045 to 12 cos others booked earlier got 12 o'clock slot. As this is cny period any slot is good for us cos we just need a place to eat with iur loved ones. The food is average but the memory lingers a long time.

Reached the shop at 11.04am to settle payment and collected my order at 11.32am. unpleasant experience. If you can't honoured the time, then let me know when I put in my order and not having your customer to wait for God long how long! I need to rush off to other place fyi. I have to rush them to speed up because I have other appointment to attend to!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMGVES2hnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Lobster porridge very nice. Black pepper beef is tender. Marmite ribs tasty. Yam paste is average.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaE5hbG5nRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,We ordered their signature chicken braised with cabbage and also tao fu with jin chng gu & spinach - very yummy. Their prices also reasonable. The waitress also very good - she advised us above 2 dishes enough to eat for 3 of us which is true. Fully recommend this place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeGRpWDlnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Above average local restaurant - worth a visit anytime.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNzUyRHh3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Great place for lunch where they offer lunch sets with a drink for around $5-7 depending on what you get. The place itself would benefit from some sprucing up especially the toilet as it can be somewhat dirty at times. Apparently famous for the lobster porridge but I have yet to try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcFotdDV3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,Food is OK and price reasonable
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwZ3FqNC1RRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Food taste is so good permeate the stomach that increase one's appetite.  Chef has excellent culinary skills which draw the best favour out of each dish and the sauces greatly enhanced the natural taste of seafood and meats.  The chilli sauce is a must try and unforgettable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX2N2UldnEAE,Chui Xiang Kitchen,3,Should patronise this eatery if you are near that area after a walk at lower pierce reservoir.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbGQyRWdBRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,The best crabs dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeUpqSDd3RRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Very good quality zi char food at relatively decent prices. Read the reviews on this place earlier and ordered the pumpkin prawn, salted egg yolk sotong, Marmite pork ribs, smoked duck with jelly fish, and cabbage wrapped chicken in claypot. Really loved the first 4 dishes as they were executed very well! The cabbage chicken was interesting but too soft and drenched in gravy for my liking. Chicken was also a bit dry on the inside. Service was friendly and prompt. Got nice drinks like lemongrass drink and water chestnut which was refreshing. Parking can be a killer here so opt to take public transport or Grab if possible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcV92eXBnRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,4,"Truth be told, it's just another tse char place around the area. Although there's a fancy story behind the place, and many people celebrating occasions at this restaurant, it's really just an above average tse char restaurant. Menu is extensive, and they carry good pricey expensive dishes, worthy of big birthday celebrations. If you're looking for simple cooked rice and noodle dishes, they also have it here. Personally quite like the beef hor fun and the dry beef hor fun."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZb3YzZDNRRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,Chui Xiang Kitchen never disappoints. Their staff are friendly and their lobster porridge is to die for. A pot of porridge is enough but their other dishes are great too that my friends and I always end up ordering more and overfilling our bellies with great food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcjlxSl9nRRAB,Chui Xiang Kitchen,5,"Fantastic value for money, well executed dishes. When ordering the beef hor fun, order the small portion for better wok hei. You can read the recommendations on the walls of the outlet"

Had a craving for sour veg fish and saw review for this place is not bad. It did not disappoint! $18 for the dish and portion is generous and the soup super appetising! Tries the skewers and love the spices they sprinkled on it. Decent prices, good taste and did not gave too wait too long. Will be back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d2Q3ekNBEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"$122 for 4 pax!

Thumbs up to the staff for their attentive  service 👍🏻👍🏻

Food had been great!
Love the veggies dishes!
The young adults definitely will love the skewer options!

Worth to return for more"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX01PNmpBRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"Ordered 烤鱼，bean curd skin, spicy clams and skewers. Overall quite satisfying. Staff were attentive. Price for the skewers quite cheap but do note they require min 5 to order. Will return to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbjhTMmh3RRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,Don’t let the name and decor out you off. The chefs know their stuff here and the food is actually really good and the pricing is also good. Service is disinterested but good enough. Enjoy!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdGNMM3pRRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"Chinese food restaurant that specialises in Sichuan dishes. The hot pots and some of the dishes have 3 different level of spiciness and the top level will melt your face if you are not a spice connoisseur.

Tried the sour vegetables fish stew at the spiciest level and it was blazing spicy. The heat didn’t mask the flavourful broth, sweet vegetables and the freshness of the fish which is fantastic. The skewers was very good with standouts been the mantou, garlic shoots and pig’s large intestines. Will try the bull frog fry pot the next time with the full family.

Pricing is very affordable for the taste and portions. There are alcohol available too and are served icy cold. Was there on a Saturday dinner and the serving staffs were friendly and adequate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb0lIX1p3EAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,3,"Decent food, good portions, decent prices. The dishes were all on the salty side. We ordered an iced lemon tea but was not served. Had to change it to a coke eventually as they ran out of lemon tea. But, they billed us both items 🤦🏽‍♀️. Only realised it after we left the restaurant 😣. Would have given it a higher rating if service was better or at least more attentive. Haiz.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeHZEcVVnEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,3,"Tried their signature frog pot (original) and thought it was not bad. The soup goes really well with the rice. The grilled eggplants was garlicky and went well with rice as well. Egg plant is def a must try.
The lamb skewers were OK, not gamey at all. The tomato egg drop soup was a little bland but considering the strong flavour profiles of the other dishes, I was OK with it.
The cold cucumber dish was so-so tho. Would recommend ordering their grill veggie skewers instead.

Service was a little slow considering that there wasn't a lot of customers in the shop. The interval between the dishes were quite big and the cold cucumber dish which is an appetiser came right at the end. Def an area worth improving for the shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaXVYUEN3EAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,3,"Decent and affordable price Sichuan food in AMK. When i have craving for Sichuan food, this will be a not bad choice. However, if you really want good good sichuan food, i think other places can offer better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydk9PWF9BRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,2,"It's my second visit and this visit was 100% opposite to my last experience in 2021.I was not lucky this round. Even though I specially mentioned to have the soup less salty,
Every dish we ordered was way too salty ! 酸菜鱼，辣子鸡，肉串。。It was a treat for my 70 year old mom... but because it was way too salty, we didn't enjoy the meal at all. I had to scrape off the excess sauces on the bbq, asked for the soup to be diluted (which is still very salty).
I have feedback to the kitchen when I made payment, not sure if they take this seriously.. But I think I'm not confident of returning anymore. It was a bad experience for my mom who likes 川菜. $60 for very salty food that you can't stomach,  not worth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMElYYVZBEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"One of my favourite 川菜馆。Love their bbq sticks and also 辣子鸡. Price is reasonable. If you are coming on a weekdays, usually there is no queue. However, weekends recommended to book before coming. They have private room for booking too if you prefer to have some privacy. They also offer 麻辣香锅 and other nice delicacies."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaElUbU9nEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"family favourite restaurant, dishes are value for money in terms of taste and portions, highly recommend the 酸菜鱼 (pickled vegetable fish, $18) as well as hotpot cauliflower!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGM3UlpREAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"The mala fish soup was really flavorful, with a bit of chinese wine. Beancurd skin is a side order. The spices in the meat skewers were good, masking the gamey mutton taste. Spicy chicken is unique, not your typical flavor. But a bit on the sweet side."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPejhhOHJRRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"Properly one of the best Spicy Sichuan Frog leg.
My favourites. Really very good and spicy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2NyUFFnEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,Good beef mala and sour fish. Super addictive and appropriate for cooling evening. Spice level can be adjusted to suit your tastebuds. Overall a good experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTejRXMTF3RRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"Despite its odd sounding name, this restaurant is worth a visit. It serves spicy mala Sichuan dishes.

The odd sounding name has to do with them serving bull frog as one of their signature. We had the chicken hotpot and added ingredients like beef, noodles, and vegetables. Although we asked for less spicy, to us, it was still very spicy so for those of you who are not so tolerant of spicy food, beware!

We also ordered some bbq skewers - beef, mutton, pork belly, chicken 🐔 ... all were tasty and nice.

We will be back to try their bbq fish and also their signature bull frog hotpot.

Recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOTVLbE93EAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"Most skewers are good, pork belly skewers are especially awesome!! Ma la xiang guo is pretty good too; they cut the ingredients into bite sizes, very easy to eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvbjh2R0hnEAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"Ordered a steam fish Mala soup and a Ala Carte with multiple ingredient with medium spiciness! Really nice!
The taste is strong and flavourful but less fragrant as compared to the Mala store at NEX food court and Central food court. But still good and value for money.
Food was great...but I really dislike the ambience and the music."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJaG9UT2VREAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,4,"Dropped by this place for Chong Qing grilled fish and was not disappointed. The fish and sauce is really really nice! We had the 香辣 soup based and added a few sides. The servings of the sides are really generous. Much much more generous than the famous Tan Yu imo. I will definitely drop by again for their MLXG next time! And, having robot waitress to serve the dishes is so innovative and cute!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4aFlHTHdBRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,1,"Super horrible service. Service staff belittle Singaporeans and prioritise mainlanders' orders. Waited 45 mins with no dish in sight and even shown aggression when we want to cancel our order. Junior staff knows nothing and senior staff is very very rude.

Overall if you're a Singaporean and decide to visit this place, make sure you enjoy feeling berated, demeaned and looked down upon like second class citizens.

Food in my picture is cold too, even sashimi is warmer than this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTc3V2Snp3RRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"awesome place for 串串 and hot pot stuff !

nice food , reasonable prices for food abd beer!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMUpiWjJ3RRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"Was at ah gu kaka wa for the first time. Tried the sour & spicy soup, la zi ji (crispy and tasty) and tomatoes scramble egg. The food was delicious and reasonable in price. The frog leg seems like a popular dish appearing on most of the diner's table. Could try them out if you are around the corner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbjR5WHJBRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,"Quite a quiet place despite the loud lights and decor - the food was nice and reasonably priced. Had the sour spicy soup which was suitable for 3-5 pax. However it was so good that i finished it eventhough it was only 2 of us. The skewers were well seasoned and i enjoyed the chicken innards skewer although we were deceived by the sausage skewer thinking it was the taiwanese sausage but it turned out to be just overpriced ntuc sausage. The barley was another plus point. Not too sweet and was cooling after a hot meal. Overall, would return for a meal again and to try other dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4blpPQ1hREAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,1,"Order food for non spicy for kids, but all food come with chili in it.

Told them that there are chili in the dish, they just took out the chili and reserve the dish again.

Very dishonest and dirty of the restaurant to re-serving the food."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXenBYYXZnRRAB,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,5,I have been finding the satay and Mala fish taste like this for a long time..really really nice.even my grandpa said 👉No Complaint with the taste..price are affordable 😍😍😍😍😍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdGRuSkp3EAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,3,"We walked in without reservation at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon in Dec 2021 and there were many available tables.  Service was pleasant and prompt.

We ordered several dishes including the Chicken Hotpot, Griddle Cabbage with Pork, Spicy Fried Chicken, Tomato Eggs, and some assorted skewers.  Out of all the food, only the skewers were good.

The Chicken Hotpot was very disappointing, it was oily and the chicken were mostly chicken bones with little meat.  We ordered the Large portion but it was very little.  We had to add a plate of spicy fried chicken as there was very little meat.

The Griddle Cabbage was very oily, serving was small, and there were only 3 small slices of pork in it.

Tomato Egg was too salty and we needed rice to go with it.  We probably wont visit again in the near future, but if we do, we will probably only go for the skewers.

Total pax: 4
Total cost: $130 (food, with 2 botts of beer and 1 llum juice)"

Their Restaurant At Amk Dijtsun Mall. ytd i take away Mala xiang guo. While i  was eating I found that inside the food got a piece of rubber band. I came to exchange but staff didnt say sorry. the 2nd time still got the rubber band. so i told them. But all staff showed the black  face and told me ""You come again?"". ""The rubber band doesn't belong to us, it is your rubber band. We dont have that kind of rubber band"". Omg! I just bought only. Their attitude was like I owe them money. That's unacceptable. Please look in to it seriously if u still want to continue the business in this COVID 19.  U noe This issue i can report ur restaurant To NEA"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MmNmSUR3EAE,Ah Gu Kaka Wa 国昌川味馆,1,"Terrible service.
Waited for an hour for frog hot pot.

Only 4 tables were occupied at that time.
A table arrived 15 mins later than us, has been served their dishes.
The waitress attitude was very bad. One of the waitress actually replied “不管我的事！问主长！” Superior actually gave us permission to leave as they are unable to serve the dish after an hour.

NOT RECOMMENDED at all."

Also ordered the 醋溜白菜. It’s quite expensive for veg and the plate is quite small too. Taste is ok, for those who don’t like too spicy and sour dish shd be ok. But I like my 醋溜白菜 to be more spicy.
Overall taste is good for the dishes I ordered. Will come back and try other dishes next time."

After coming out she left the toilet without washing her hands. Disgusting standards of personal hygiene.

The salted egg pork ribs were flavourful and the sauce was generous. Enough salted egg omph in my opinion. The oysters in the oyster omelette were big and tasted fresh - no fishy taste. French beans were meh for the price paid and could be skipped. The special tofu didn't feel very special but still alright. The fried Ee mian was not bad too. Total cost for 5 dishes was $50 for 4 pax."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MXMyalhREAE,Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood,5,"For 3 of us, we ordered the pork ribs, sambal kangkong and clay pot bean curd with 3 rice. Total $29.10 ... I like that they deep fry the pork ribs first then coat with savoury sweet sour sauce. The sambal kangkong was also delicious. Fried with enough ""haebi"" giving it a robust sambal belachan taste. I've eaten the same stuff elsewhere but it was another level up over here.  Highly recommended. Sorry for not having photos as we walloped the food and then realising after that we should have."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdFlDU2ZBEAE,Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood,5,Good quality food at reasonable price. Good to dine in with well decorated environment that does not look like coffeeshop. Had pork curry rice and white bee hoon. Was good.

Prawn paste chicken and xo pork ribs are our favourites. The sautéed broccoli with garlic is also just nicely done, not undercooked or overcooked. Love their San lau horfun, too. Fried rice is quite good, so is their beef fried rice. Their fish slice fried rice wasn't good though with slightly cold fish slices like it was cooked beforehand, put into the fridge, and then just thrown in with the fried rice when the rice was done. Their chicken fried rice was also not so good with pieces of chicken that was hard."

It was nearing closing hours but the auntie who served us still did it with a smile. She was also considerate enough to remind us to order drinks if we need as the coffeeshop will be closed soon.

Tried the San Lao Hor Fun and the Ee Mee. Both were very tasty.

The San Lao Hor Fun came with thick gravy. The beansprouts were crispy and the fish slices were fresh.

The Ee Mee was fragrant and enjoyable with the slightly burnt taste which is missing from so many other Zhi Char stores nowadays."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNTl2UnZ3RRAB,Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood,2,Food is mediocre and average. Place is well-decorated and looks good from the outside. Assam fish we ordered was not fresh. Sambal potato leaves is near tasteless. Prawn Paste Chicken wasn't too bad. Gst and sevice charge is inclusive in the dish price. Hits and misses in their food. May come back here again if they improve.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVcWFUZGZREAE,Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood,1,"The quality of the food is getting from bad to worse. And the service crew at Blk 422 AMK is so rude. I was having my usual lunch alone after a morning run nearby and ordered from them. When the food come, instead of placing the plate of rice in front of me, she placed it one seat away, and the sauce spilled out due to the impact when she placed the food on the table. Did I owe them any money? Or have I been particularly rude to them? I dont think so. So why do the customer warrant such attitude from the service crew? If this is the quality of service you are providing, all the best to your business."

And the size of fried ""large"" hor fun is simply outrageous! It's just a normal 1 serving that you can get from any other restaurants of this type in Singapore.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndE9EdlFBEAE,Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood,1,Zichar stall staff's attitudes are pretty lacking. Food-wise is disappointing and standards dropping compared to last year.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta2F5T3FBRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,4,"It’s just a counter for taking away, no seating for dining at the moment
It’s soft launching, has not officially opened yet. Thus no long queue, waiting time (after order placed) is about 5-10min, kitchen will prepare upon order (steam or deep fried)

Food wise, not everything on menu is available now, e.g char siew polo pau.

Price wise is at the high side. But taste was ok . Will patronage again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta2NXVE13EAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,3,Only takeaway. Price is about the same as a restaurant - perhaps due to the excessive packaging. Quality of food is good. Would have given it 4-5stars if price is more friendly given that it is located in a heartland.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbjVYQjBRRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,5,"Service has been pretty fast and the food is yummy.  The dumpling in spicy chilli oil is quite good though I will prefer for it to be even more spicy.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbklyLUJREAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,3,"Went today, not much crowd during sunday lunch time. Friendly aunty. We ordered chee chong fun, siew mai, ha gao. Quite standard. Dont try the red bean bun, super dry. Rest of the food was ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbFk3RTlnRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,4,"As the name implies, this is more for take away than for dining in. There are a few tables inside but it is really cramped for groups more than 2 pax. Price is reasonable and standard of dim sum is better than most places - we had it dine in instead of take away. There was not a lot of take away when we were there so food was getting served about 5 mins of waiting."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNUxfZ0RBEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,"Service is abit slow after ordering, approximately wait for 15mins.
The fried dim sum, example fried seafood bean curd, alot of grease drip when bite. Overall, food tasting not worth the price. Too expensive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejhqdUtnEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,2,Just a look at the photo and you know how inconsistent the food is. Totally not worth it and it cost just about as much as restaurant price for takeaway.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNm9fOE9BEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,5,"Very pleasant experience. I frequent their flag ship outlet at Jalan Besar area when they were still those old run down dim sum place.
Now they are closer to me at Amk, I love their mee suah kueh. Always my favourite. Their banana prawn is awesome too. Yam paste with ginkgo nuts is good too.

Really nothing to complain about. It’s very very tasty. Their set menu is very affordable too !

Good job Swee Choon! But if possible to move inside the mall it’s even better so can queue and wait in aircon area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdWJTTF9nRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,3,Generally dim sum is ok except for the egg tart.. the egg tart need more improvement.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMk1leHRBRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,"seriously big waste of time and money. also the WORSE hargao ive had in my life. cold and dry. ordered 2 pcs of meesua kueh and 2 pcs of hargao, and waited 20 mins! while my food sat at the counter turning cold! after i placed my order the cashier told me to wait outside the glass door and she would call me when my orders ready. the billboard which flashed the queue numbers never updated. i stood outside the shop for a GOOD 20 MINS AND GUESS WHAT? MY FOOD WAS LONG READY, SITTING AT THE INNER COUNTER, AND THE LADY NEVER NOTIFIED ME WHEN SHE SAID SHE WOULD. I GOT IMPATIENT AND ASKED WHERES MY FOOD, THEN THE LADY WHO PROMISED TO NOTIFY ME BUT DIDNT HANDED ME MY COLD FOOD. ALL THESE COULD BE PREVENTED IF THEY FIXED THEIR SYSTEM AND HAD BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbGJISWlBRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,5,"Very good spot and conveniently located near taxi stand. If you crave for Swee Choon Legendary Dim sum this is certainly a good place to satisfy your craving. Self ordering kiosk works just fine. I step in , select few dishes for me and my family, receipt printed out with a queue number. Less than 5minutes my order are readily available. Taste as good as I remembered, food are excellent. Highly recommended 👍🏻👍🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteThUajd3RRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,4,"Only takeaway, price wise rather steep! Compared to dine in. Do note that there is a price hike when you order via grab!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazVMUzFBRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,"Ordered a bunch of food for takeaway, turned out they have missed an order despite the slow service and the little amount of people and orders from their takeaway board. I doesn't know how low standard this branch can gets but if Google review allows negative star this would be minus 2 star. They should have done their diligent can check the amountof food with the orders. Disappointed with swee choon for allowing their branches to provide substandard service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3RXNm1nRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,2,"slow service, we were told to wait for our orders in the hot afternoon sun, everyone was sweating. Order took about 10-15 mins to be ready though queue wasnt to long. Menu was rather pricy for a heartland takeaway kiosk, but sure if I will buy again. Shengkee & other dimsum/dessert  places provides better options, more choices & better value."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNFkzcmVnEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,4,I like their plain chee cheong fun texture. French toast loved by my boy. Go off peak and the wait will be more bearable. We went like brunch hours. Not 5 stars because 输在har gao is disappointing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamZDUDV3RRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,"I placed a pre-order at 9:30am to be delivered at 6pm, and my order was cancelled at 5:43pm without any form of communication. When I tried to place an order again, they cannot be found on Foodpanda anymore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOFo2d0RnEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,4,"The Mrs and I ordered an assortment of dishes such as the porridge, tofu bomb, egg tarts, siew mai etc. The Mrs raved immensely about the porridge and it shows as we dropped by earlier today around noonish and the porridge was already out of stock. Personally, among all the dishes I tried, the tofu bomb is the one I would come back for. The price and portion is reasonable. It obtains what seems like diced up pieces of prawn, possibly fish paste, chives and probably small pieces of chilli. It is flavourful with a hint of spiciness from the chilli inside. As it's deep fried, it's the usual moist but mostly from the oil it soaked up from the cooking process. Ordering system and waiting time was acceptable. We were able to figure it out without any assistance. We will definitely come back for more again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtX2QyMVBBEAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,"The worst customer experience ever! They ask you join the queue to order. After order, the system allowed you to order and pay. You will be asked to wait outside under the hot sun. After waiting for so long, they will tell you out of stock and refund you. So you basically queue to get refund of your own money! Such a waste of time! Staffs are rude too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtekpyallREAE,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,2,It says Swee Choon Express. It should be called Swee Choon Slow. I waited for 15 min for two orders of pao. They should not have the word 'Express' for the amk branch so as to manage customers expectation. I recommend that you make your order then go for a walk at the hub then return to collect.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX2J1aHZBRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,1,Bot some pau and har gao...fresh and delicious. However disappointed with the fun choy...seem to have kept for some time...apparently staff did not observed slow moving food...Price is a bit stiff in this neighborhood area...though the packing is reasonable good.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMTdqdDhRRRAB,Swee Choon Express AMK Hub,2,"My advice for dim sum patrons. This is certainly not Express, instead the waiting time is damn long. Try it if you have spare time to wait."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LTZqZmdBRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"A very traditional looking shop and my friend commented she felt like shes back home in China. The 梅菜扣肉was really good. Not overly seasoned and jus right with rice. Love the salted chicken, simple but yet can taste the original taste of the dish. The chilli is really good as some reviewers have commented. 算盘子is very unique.. unlike the commercial selling ones that's very chewy, this is slightly more towards sour and also very powdery full of yummy yam rather than flour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNmZxS1ZREAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,"Heard of this shop from reviews by some friends and decided to check it out. First feel is that the shop is really old school and authentic.

We chose the 4 pax package. The hakka noodles and suan pan zi felt like it was pre cooked, instead of cooked fresh. The taste of the hakka noodles were abit disappointing in the sense that it was to the blender side. However, this might be because the other dishes are saltier and the noodles might be meant to be eaten with the other dishes.

The yong tau foo is really nth to shout out about. Average at best.

The 梅菜扣肉 was towards the saltier side, but I really like the flavor. I would have given a higher rating if the pork was more tender. But some people like it that way. The chicken was nicely done.

Their chillis are a must try for those who are in for a kick and it really blends well with all the dishes.

Staff was courteous, efficient, and nice. One thing I really liked was that this restaurant serves Chinese tea or warm water foc. Which is so hard to find nowadays and something I really appreciate.

Overall, price was very decent and it is a nice establishment to support and visit. All da best to their business."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXck9yVnJnRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,"Authentic Hakka restaurant tucked within Sembawang Hills, been here for more than 30 years. Upon entering you will be greeted by a cozy vibe with traditional red lanterns and maps.

Ordered 4 pax meal for $52 that includes all their signature dishes. Tea is charged for $1 each, refillable.
Hakka Noodles and Mei Cai Kou Rou on the drier side but it was still as tasty.
Spring onion beef tripe is an additional order and it was chewy with light hint of spring onions that isn't overpowering."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnZPNGV3EAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"We walked-in without reservation on vesak day evening at 5.30pm. We are a family of 4. We are lucky to be able to have a table as the restaurant is fully booked. We were told that we can only have the table till 6.30pm as they have reservations. We are fine with it. We ordered the 4 person set which is a very big portion. Ordered additional 2 white rice to eat with the 梅菜扣肉. Best decision. Guess which dish got wipe out by us first 😄. Within 5 mins after ordering , the dishes are served. Wow. Impressive. As a hakka, the dishes fits our profile, salty enough...Will bring my parents here next time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX19IVmdBRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",2,Was disappointed with their menu selection. Imagine the four of us had to order every single dish on the menu to have enough to eat! So sad that COVID had hit this restaurant so badly that they had to diminish their menu to so small.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eDZmdU5BEAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,"When I made a few sporadic visits for takeaway last year, the food standard for their regular dishes kind of dropped. During the Chinese New Year period the 梅菜扣肉 was bland. However, last month's takeaway of their set menu was the best. All the dishes still taste good although it's a takeaway. The portions are big. Well worth the $48. My family polished off the food that night. But I have not tried their delivery service though."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dl9qWjBnRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",3,"In my personal opinion, overall experience just average. Service is a struggle during lunch with only 1 or 2 staff available for the whole restaurant. Understandable... but...

The most disappointing is the quantity of the food served. Small portion is pretty much for 1 pax. While even medium at best is 3 pax. The worse dish is the steam chicken. Priced min. at $18.80 and smallest available is only medium size, full of bones & very little meat. I have to clean the bones like a vulture so there will be meat for my lady friends. I dare to say never in my life to eat such tiny quantity at such price.

Food in pics total up to $90 for 3 pax. Sorry last min. take because trying all food with too high expectations i guess...

Other than that, overall food taste like home cook. Nothing impressive much. Perhaps great place for older folks. Most customer i see are old people. Just observations..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NGRicEp3EAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"One of the oldest hakka restaurant in Singapore. Bamboo windows, hazardous power sockets with too many plug-ins, round table with my grandmother's tablecloth, newspaper cutout on a piece of cupboard for a menu, and 1970s kampung photos made up the interior. Food looked homecooked, but the flavours are just....wow. Saucy salted chicken that fall off the bones paired with scallion oil dip, an unseemingly normal tofu with meat that exploded with umani, and a wok-hei fried-egg noodles are just some of the highlights. Love the vibes, would love to see this place stay like this.

Edit: Sitting by the windows, i saw the waiter rushing out with a bag of food towards a waiting car with windows rolled down. So they still do food pickup like the old days! Just so much memories!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3VucGtnRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"Authentic Hakka dishes served at very reasonable prices. Food is not too salty, unlike many other restaurants. 猪肚 in the 猪肚汤 is super soft. 梅菜扣肉 is soft, fragrant, and you can savour the original taste of 梅菜. 算盘子 is soft and fragrant and not the rubbery kind. Only downside is very hard to find parking nearby."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bi1qUTNBRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,Authentic Hakka food with generous serving and warm hospitality. Their food are homemade dishes that will warm the cockles of your heart. The boss treats customers like friends and ensures that they are well taken care of.

Service was less than desirable, especially when calling for a reservation. Pricing was definitely reasonable and we do really get too many hakka restaurants around, which makes this place unique."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNW9QbGx3RRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,At last get to try this Hakka restaurant. Ordered a set for 4 at SGD48. Really worth it. Taste is close to original Hakka village claim by grandma. Do book early to avoid disappointment. Am lucky to walk in n have a seat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bnR5VWN3EAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,Pass by this restaurant many times before but did not entry as it seems to be rather rustic.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aDlUNVpREAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"The last time I was here must have been over 20 years ago… same familiar taste, very authentic Hakka. Just like how my grandparents used to cook. Must try: salt chicken, bitter gourd Yong tao fu with the bean broth… and abacus, of course.!  Even a simple noodle with minced pork.. al dente! Or QQ :).  Way ahead of Koo Kee… Place is simple even though aged.. personable service, like you walked into someone’s home. The patriarch pacing around the restaurant… and complimentary sweet potato  black sugar ginger syrup. A few elderly gentlemen just walked in.. and the patriarch just said: 我给您准备一个菜心、算盘子、酿豆腐…  customers just said… OK!   Do check them out soon. Keep the old banner and traditional taste going…"

The restaurant environment here looks like 80s. There is also lantern hanging with lantern riddles. Heard from the owner if guess correctly, may have prize.

Ordered some Hakka dishes like Miced Meat Noodle, Fried Prawns with Hakka Wine, Fried Yam ball and Yong Tau Fu.

The boss even threw in a small appetizer Hakka spring roll which I guess was to thank us for our patience in waiting for a table. Services were good! Felt quite homely and like the older days when you still can see the boss in the restaurant, which is unlike most other that have been commercialized. Price was reasonable."

Serves Hakka dishes such as yam abacus 算盘子, salted chicken, yong tau foo and 梅菜扣肉。Decoration is very 70's style and bring back memories from that era. Worth the trip up north if you are craving for Hakka food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bHRIY29BRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",3,"The food was very light. Compared with the usual Chinese Asian dishes the food tastes more like home cooked dishes done by your grandma. Not very flavourful but not bad in general. Simply put it nothing really stands out much, but it’s a cozy place to have home made food. The only downside was probably the heat inside. The aircon was not working even though there are two. We kept sweating during the dinner. Hope it can be fixed."

Delicious, authentic, generous and affordable. For those who enjoy having restaurant food that does not have a 'central kitchen / factory' taste, this is definitely a place worth trying.

The dishes we tried are:
1. 客家付卷 - Hakka Beancurd Fritters
2. 客家酿豆腐 - Hakka Yong Tou Foo
3. 梅菜扣肉 - Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable
4. 蚝油奶白 - Nai Bai in Oyster Sauce
5. 东江盐鸡 - Steamed Chicken
6. 萝卜丸 - Radish Balls

Note: Some dishes (especially the steamed chicken) may be a tad salty for some; but it's perfect for me!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbkwzZlJnEAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",1,"Made a reservation here and specially travelled here from the east. However, my dad forgot to bring his phone but only his token. The waiter refused to allow to enter since my dad do not have his phone.

I asked them to used the app to perform the verification but they refused to do so. Very disappointed by their service. They are probably sticking to traditions...

If you wish to come pls remember to bring your phone and ur old parents' phones too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0aE5MampRRRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"Favourite Hakka/Chinese restaurant to have a hearty satisfying meal. You better make reservations esp on weekends, if not arrive when they open and you might be lucky.
A must order is their Hakka Tofu and Preserved Veg with Braised Pork. I also tried their duck before and it was amazing. This place is well loved by my family, hubby and friends too!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaVB5alBnEAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,Really nice Hakka food. They feel like home food and very affordable for a restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0OEpYMUJ3EAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,Overall not bad. The 梅菜扣肉 tasted more at the sweet side though. Would definitely recommend the vinegar pork leg. Yummms!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MS1lWFNnEAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",5,"Very good food that tastes like a home-cooked meal at zichar prices, in a homely restaurant that harks back to 80s or even 70s Singapore. All the dishes my group of 4 had were delicious: preserved vegetables with pork, red wine sauce prawns, salt-baked chicken, yong tau foo, Hakka fried yam, even the basic broccoli. Service was prompt and attentive. There was no GST or even service charge! We'll definitely be back soon.

The restaurant also prepares bento boxes for takeout for only $5.80. If only I lived nearby."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdzhDdXN3RRAB,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,"Delicious family-run restaurant which has been around for generations. Hopefully it will continue to be around for longer in to the future.

Their salted chicken, braised pork with vegetables and tofu are all amazing. My favourites dishes. Great every time!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdVpUMlVBEAE,"Plum Village Restaurant, 梅村酒家",4,"Tried their set menu for 4 persons. We like the braised pork, tofu, and salted chicken (looks dry but it’s not, thanks god). The fried noodle is a bit bland and the yam chicken is not what we like.

Make sure you know a bit mandarin since they don’t have English menu and speaks little English."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNTZXUXpRRRAB,Qua Le Xiao Chu,3,"It is located at Blk 555 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10.It is a neighbourhood Chinese restaurant serving Northern Chinese and Szechuan cusuines.The restaurant is not big in size , so sitting capacity is limited.The restaurant is quite vacant in the day and gets alittle busier in the evenings during dinner time.On Sundays the business is better.The food standards depends on individuals as taste and preferences for foods differs individually
Example if you like Northern Chinese or Szechuan ( Hot & Spicy ) foods , then you may like the foods.Parking wise is easy at the HDB car park behind.Public busstop is also just at the road ( Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 ) infront, quite convenient also.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPalBlOUJBEAE,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,5,"Tried the Alacart buffet on a Friday night (need at least 3 pax). The food was really great. I recommend the spicy lala, prawn paste chicken, romantic prawn. The spicy steam fish is amazing too. Give the yam a chance, it’s amazing! The other desserts are so so only!  Definitely would come back again!

Wendy Tan service is really amazing! Kudos to her and her team for the great service! Birthday boy can dine for free! Would come back here again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPak5mWEtnEAE,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,5,"Very good food and service. The abalone, LALA, and Yam paste is a must try!!!

Our waitress Wendy Tan really went out of the way to make us welcome.

😍😍😍😍 WILL COME BACK AGAIN!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDVheWl3RRAB,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,5,"This was where we held our wedding. I liked the flexibility of being able to upgrade dishes from the cheapest plan to those that we liked better. I also appreciated other perks that were included in the package including the printing of wedding cards, wedding favours and free corkage.

Owen was an amazing coordinator who never failed to respond to my questions and arrange to things I require on the wedding day. Wendy helped me on the actual wedding day, leading us in and out of the ballroom for changing, as well as with the tea ceremony.

We were also able to book a meeting room at the Grassroots' Club separately for our tea ceremony which made things really convenient.

My guests loved the ballroom and food and we had an amazing time all in all.

Thank you so much for helping us hold such a successful wedding! Eternal Garden Restaurant has proved that you don't need to hold your wedding at a fancy and expensive hotel to have a wonderful wedding. Would totally recommend this place if you're looking for a small venue for 50 to 100 pax though they can probably accommodate up to 200 people too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydnZPeXFnRRAB,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,2,"The wedding venue was clean and spacious. It was not bad. We eventually chose to go with Qian Xi but i had a very bad experience with Torrance.

Torrance was really disrespectful throughout the conversation for discussion of prices, number of tables and so and so. Torrance paid no heed to me and talked over me when i am asking questions about the banquet. He looked at my husband the entire time and it was like i didn’t exist the entire time. I felt really horrible because it was supposed to be a gathered discussion, it seemed like my opinion did not matter. My husband even tried to include me but Torrance would just ignore me. Really really horrible experience. But because of time constraints we had no choice but to go with Qian Xi.

Thankfully, Owen was really helpful throughout the entire experience and provided lots of assurance and insights about the flow etc. Feedbacks during the food tasting was taken into consideration and food was really good during the banquet itself! Staff service was good as well!

Anyways, we had feedback to some of our friends about Torrance and they seem to have similarly bad experience. Beware of this Torrance dude cause he might just ruin your day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa29iRWFnEAE,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,4,good value for money!  Wendy Tan is the best waitress  Ive ever encountered in Singapore. Very friendly and she seems enjoy her work fully.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d292VE9REAE,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,5,"All the dishes are delicious, the best should be the steamed fish.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOC03d25RRRAB,Eternal Garden Restaurant 永福楼,2,"Kampong chicken and duck looked and tasted overnight. All the other dishes below par. Any normal zi char outside is better. Will probably not go back there again. Actually the worst i have been to.

All dishes were well-executed and flavourful. Service was good at this outlet. Advisable to make a table reservation on weekends for indoor seating. Price was reasonable for the portions. Happy to be back again :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnBXZ3J3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Ordered for 6 pax today, food is good 👍🏻 chicken’s the highlight of course 🤣 bean sprout tasted a little raw, could be cooked more thoroughly. Portion is good and price is fair 😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLWJQUVJ3EAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Food were nice, Chicken was tender and juicy. Love the Coffee Pork Ribs, Claypot Taufoo was pretty good, filled with fish slices, prawns, brocoli, black fungus, mushrooms and taufoo. Love the Fish Maw Soup too! The Chicken rice was delicious which was cooked with Alchemy fibre added and was said to be lower GI."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydi02a3FnRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"2nd May 2022, public holiday, took mom to several places but packed came over here as she never step in before.  She was lucky to get seats after I dropped her 1st.  The table is filled with side dishes, I enter 5 mins after and got a shocked.  The honey chardoew is nice, pigs neck braised, haebeehiam and braise peanuts are awesome.  Order the 3 eggs spinach and a plate of steamed chicken  for 1 pax , 1 pot of chrysanthemums tea and we are done.

Mom loved the food as she seldom dine out of her zone ar her neighbourhood.

Staff were friendly and helpful.  Overall my boss said good choice.
Phew..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN1otWFhnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Regardless which outlet you choose, the food is delicious (standard is there). Family of 3 -Had half a chicken de-boned, 3 plates of Cha Siew (very nice), fried toufu and a plate of veg."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyX3JXQk9REAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,"The service was pretty bad. I mean, we’re paying customers, not the wait staff’s debtors. Food was slightly below expectations I mean… fried tofu is a pretty standardised dish. Chicken could be more tender and was fatty.

Try chicken house at upper Thomson if you want better chicken rice"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ2Jfa0JREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Had a family meal, the service was great and so was the food. I made a booking and good thing I did it because it was soon busy for lunch!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLb0tXQ3ZRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,This is the only place I don't mind steamed chicken instead of roasted chicken. The rice is very fragrant and we ended up eating many bowls. Service was good. The takeaway offer at $5.50 before gst is a good deal.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaFAtX0xREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Taste: love it!
Esp. the tofu is really nice!! Soft and smooth and tasty

Vegetarian options available"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOE9xZE1BEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,Their Bento sets are really nice and premium. The only problem I have is only 1 Vegetables choice which is Kai Lan and nobody’s favorite. The restaurant at AMK is getting dated and is in dire need of a renovation.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyckl6VkFREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,1,"Extremely bad experience. How is it possible that a chicken rice restaurant have no chicken to sell especially on Mother's Day? Extremely bad planning! It's a day of celebration, and you should anticipate that it's a day where crowds will gather especially since covid restrictions have been eased! Extremely disappointed as this is not the first time I have exprienced this. Will not recommend this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNk15RS1RRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,"My favourite Boon Tong Kee branch. The service is good; steamed chicken is excellent as always; 3 eggs spinach is great; char siew is so-so. The only dissatisfaction is the rice - not as fragant as its Boon Keng branch in my opinion. Overall, still a good place for steamed chicken rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aVkzWjJnRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,2,Used to patronise this place because food was good. Today's dinner us a disappointment.  The chicken is not tender and meaty like it used to be. Understand because of inflation everything is expensive. But for the price paid for this standard of food I think its not worth. Many hawker stalls now serve tastier chicken rice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOXJlNzV3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,"One of the more famous chicken rice restaurant in Singapore. Ordered their signature steamed chicken and also the fried chicken. Chicken wise is good but not the best. However, the fried chicken can be a bit dry. Also ordered the sweet sour pork, fried mixed vegetables, barbecued pork and the soupy spinach with Yong Taohu. The other dishes are great and complements the soft fluffy flavorful rice very well. Highly recommend their sides especially the barbecue pork. Ambience is good and service is prompt and efficient. However, can be crowded during lunchtime. Overall a good dining experience for family and large groups."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeXBQS1hREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Good food at reasonable price. The service is excellent. The white chicken is a must try. We went for dinner for a family of 6 adults and paid $147 inclusive of service charge and GST. Ordered Assam Grouper, white chicken, homemade tofu, salad prawn, prawn ngoh hiang, abalone boiled vegetables. They served the char siew, boiled peanuts and shrimp paste as appetizers. They were tasty, especially the shrimp paste. If you like fatty char siew, it’s well caramelized and charred but not burnt. We enjoyed the nice ambiance and great service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNHE2ejZ3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Great chicken rice of course!
Service was great and staff were friendly, food was served relatively quick
Usually gets crowded during peak hours"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMTVDSWZnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,1,"One of the worst Boon Tong Kee restaurant which is at Ang Mo Kio. The claypot liver was not cook properly looks like dirty liver. The claypot liver cook at Beliestier Road is so much better. The chicken rice is not serve hot, got to shout at them then they attend to you. Never eat there again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdmZyQTd3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"The best chicken Rice! There are many chicken rice stalls in Singapore  as it is a common dish Singaporeans have in our daily life. This stall to me, their way of making the Rice is the best! It is frangrance, not too oilly, and it packed in a bowl. You could simple eat it by itself without other dishes. The chili also very good! When people eat chicken rice,  another important factor is their Chicken rice chili. It is make with the chicken oil that come out when boiling the chicken and their special ingredient.  The chicken is tender and juicy, but not especially good. Usually they serve only the chili and dark black soya sauce, but you can and shold ask for ginger! This is traditional chicken stalls will serve. It blend very well with chili and black soya sauce also on chicken rice.

The other dishes that serve in the restaurent are well cook and delicious. They serve one traditional dish that is pig livers in clay pot, today you hardly find this dish. It is nice and smell really great with garlic. Another dish you may want to try is their deep fried toufu, its crispy and hot, it taste so good when u eat while it hot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOHI3a01nEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,"My wife and I went there for a weekend dinner. It was underneath a block of hdb flat which is uncommon but the service was prompt and the place was very family friendly (read: grandparents munching the life out of the drumstick, children monkeying around with mums keeping a watchful eye, dads with dismissive looks or have the eyes glued to their smartphones or the newspaper).

It looks more like a saizeriya restaurant than a Chinese restaurant but this food place brings me back esp the chicken.

Reasonably priced, good quick service, tasty rice and chicken, good for families."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncFo3dzJRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,"Hainanese chicken is juicy n tender, however the rice a dispointment, the rice grain they use can be of better quality. The braised soft peanut is a great appetiser. The restaurant also have zi char menus which I think they have a good selection of dish. It is located next to a open air carpark."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0aGNlM1lREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,"Comfort food especially after or before  long overseas trip!! Always enjoy the rice and meats plus the chilli... and if the char siew is hot, worth the try as well!! Very good variety as well across tofu, yam ring and even sweet sour pork.. vege fresh and can order drinks with sugar aside.. and non aircon seating especially at this AMK joint.. enjoy the fresh air and amolw parking.. enjoy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbWZlN1RBEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Wait staff was very friendly. Chicken was tender, and the chicken rice was flavorful while not greasy."

Very well seasoned & the taste is just right, served hot coming straight from the kitchen. Worth going there again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cXFMQUpnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,Surprisingly the stream fish was very nice. We never order chicken even they are famous for it. Just want to try other dishes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOTdyMnNRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,"Purposely went there to have takeaway from Boon Keng as they have promotion using Amex. But is a little disappointed compare to the taste near to BK Station, I ordered the usual dishes I always did. The coffee pork ribs and pork belly wasn't really good. The chicken is still good. They didn't give enough ginger and chilli tho."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRckpldkJnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Yummy!!!
We ordered Half a roast chicken, Spinach with 3 eggs, Fried Prawn Roll, Claypot chicken liver and Sliced Fish with Ginger. All for only $87!
Ample of parking space and if you are coming here on a weekend, do call in to reserve first! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0xLQTF3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"I love the food here. Don't just think that coming here is just for the chicken rice. Their other zichar food like fried vegetables, fried tofu, sweet and sour pork is delicious.

My kids have been asking me when we can go and eat again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0NmVleWh3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,"Great chicken rice for a reasonable price. I ordered the white whole chicken. Soya sauce complimented the chicken well, and other dishes such as the sambal Kang Kong and crab meat steamed egg. Great atmosphere too. The app only applies for take away. Would recommend this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbGFlZ2p3RRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,Was there yesterday afternoon with my customers. The service was fast and very polite. They have the warm and personal touch when ask for  recommendations of dishes. They know their menu very well. What food which page and even the ingredients. Well done. Will surely go again and support them.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdV8ydHRRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Excellent service by the staff. Staff informed waiting time was around 30min at lunch, but was shorter than that. Food quality is always excellent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhMzUtbnJnRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,The chicken and the chicken rice is ok. They should provide some drippings for take away I think. But staff is very friendly and professional. 😁
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM3RMa0dBEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,Plenty of parking lots outside. Service staffs are polite. Don't like that they ask you to get appetisers even before we started looking at the menu. The appetisers were $6 char siew (abt 10-12 pieces) and $2 steamed peanuts. Wet tissues at 30cents. I ordered $10 steamed chicken which seems not enough for 2 pax. Oil rice is nice but quantity is small. Their chilli is quite hot. Might not return. 925 yishun chicken rice has better steamed chicken.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTRMX1dnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,1,Poor service.. long wait for collection when tour group came in tho I already made payment. Then forgot to put in one of my dish.. check before you leave.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMi1YMTdRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Nice food, the usual BTK experience. It was quite crowded on a weekday lunch hour. Be sure to arrive early."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLXFpT1ZnEAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,1,I must agree that Boon Tong Kee’s chicken is tender and good but then the service at Ang Mo Kio branch is really slow on all my 2 visits. For take away 4 packets of standard set order placed at Sunday 4.50pm had to wait for close 20-25 mins.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcE12XzJBRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,We had lunch for 3 person on 31.1.2022. The chicken rice taste was average. Pricy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbGZUaFJ3EAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,The chicken and accompanying rice with its sauce and chilli are always consistently delicious. The meat is tender and the soy sauce that soaks it gives it that additional oomph. Service staff is efficient and cheerful. Notice they are older staff and hence more spontaneous in reacting to customers' requests.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOHJEUDRRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,4,Best hainanese white chicken. Fuss free and so singaporean. Good mix of other local doses as well
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LVl2dHhRRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,3,"The chicken rice that they are famous for is still pretty much the staple for this outfit, although they do serve up other complementary options as well. However, the food quality seems to have dipped somewhat since years ago, and many of the food items were slightly too salty (especially the roasted chicken)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpZ003NlNREAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"As always, great chicken rice. Good service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzlYaWZ3EAE,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Atas chicken rice;
Fantastic service,
generous portions.

On the pricey side for 2; but as a family eating together, average cost sorts of goes down.

Tucked away,
Nice park opposite."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpZ1pMWG5BRRAB,Boon Tong Kee @ AMK,5,"Very interesting place indeed. Very good services, most of thr staffs are bilingual too, even the older service staffs. Their chicken rice is very fragnant and its texture is also just for my 91 years old mother. Their steamed chicken is so tender and juicy too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3BMYm5RRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,Had a family dinner here. Food is very good and value for money. Seafood very fresh too. Ordered all these dishes for $235+. Most expensive was the half roasted pig $125. May be a coffee shop but quite windy and not hot. Will definitely be back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPamFISm53RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"1st time try out the food is tasty & value of money. A few dishes are recommended like sambal Kang kong, sweet & sour pork, beancurd with pork & preserved vegetable, Herbal chicken, Yam Ring  & golden cereal prawn. With definitely come back to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReUlmbzRRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,It's full house on a Saturday evening and it's a long wait for the dishes to be out. Food is nice generally but some aren't that great. The yam paste dessert isn't smooth enough. The steam fish is slightly overcooked.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LTlQdHRBRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Cheap seafood zi car place, you can’t ask for more these days. We had 16 pax with 8 dishes for 2 tables, only costs us $306. Really value for money.

Price - great!
Ambiance- can get a little stuffy since there’s is no aircond
Food - great!
Staff - easy going although they were super busy, they were not rude.
Location - good

We had
Pork meat bun - signature must try!
Curry fish head - Nyonya style, not Asam style, still good!
Herbal prawn in claypot - love it! Fresh prawn and legit herbal soup"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcks2cndnRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Had an impromptu dinner here. Quiet, spacious place. Perhaps it’s a Thursday.

Service staff was polite and efficient. No hard selling or anything.

Ordered Indonesian pork (that’s the one in the claypot). It has a nice santan laksa taste to it. Perhaps it’s me trying it for the first time. There’s hae bee too, giving it a nice umami taste.

Minced pork with chai por tofu. Came totally drenched by the minced pork and chai por. Was nice except the saltiness came on stronger as you eat it.

Italian herb pork ribs. Not sure why I kept get reminded it’s salted egg.

Overall nice place for big groups. Food’s abit salty but I guess it’s bearable cos I like heavy flavours. ◡̈"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM012SDhRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"The food is not the best zi char out there but definitely very decent and has a home cooked feel. Not too oily or salty and we were very happy with every dish.

Curry fish head was good. They tried to promote their more expensive red grouper but we had sea bass instead which was already very fresh, moist and well cooked.

Only thing is because this place is absolutely so big, it is hard to get someone when you need something or want to order."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMTdxT0VnEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"4.5 stars. Been wanting to eat here and we regretted not coming here earlier. Came at 5 plus in the evening on a weekday and there was no crowd. Ordered sweet and sour pork, hokkien noodles and kai lan with salted fish. The dishes arrived quickly. The sweet and sour pork wowed us, succulent, crispy and juicy, with pieces of pineapples and tomatoes. The other dishes were delicious too and the portions were huge. Love the vegetables, very fresh and crunchy, with fragrant pieces of salted fish. The noodles were nicely done with wok-hei. Belacan chilli was good and spicy. Would definitely return to try the other dishes!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnZyLTh3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Came on a Sunday night, many tables filled. Expected the food to take a longer time as the place was packed. Food arrived a lot quicker than expected. Probz 10mins from ordering.
Food is value for money.
The star of the meal (for me) was the fish head fried with bitter gourd.
Minced pork tofu with chai poh was a miss."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXczh6V09nEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,Price slightly high. Business pretty good though. Ordered the Kong Bak Pau  (10 for $24). Taste is good but the pork is very thinly slice. The Hong Kong noodles just too salty for me.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NzdibnFnRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"The chye poh kueh tiao was an eye opener, very unique taste! We also loved the braised pork bao and salted kampung chicken! Sambal kangkong was a flop, too watery... Overall better than an average zichar place but price is also higher... Will be back to try other dishes!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaU1qQmxBRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,"ordered a prawn paste chicken and salted egg crab
prawn paste chicken is average, prawn paste taste is not strong . but chicken served hot
salted egg crab - too much butter taste , cannot taste salted egg . too much overwhelming sauce of  butter milk . crab is fresh and meat is soft and easy separate from shell

overall price- $83"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtakl6WHpnRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,"I was there on Sat with two other friends. We ordered spinach in superior stock, golden cereal prawn, salted kampong chicken, a chilli crab with 6 mantous and orh nee with ginko nuts. The place was under-staffed and was packed with customers, hence we waited quite a while (1) before being directed to the reserved table and (2) for our dishes to be served. The food was average, nothing exceptional."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbmNYOGFREAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Not my first time here, I had always been impressed with their menu... Today is my first try of their 龙虎会 Crab with Seafood In Claypot. This is not ordinary curry or laksa crab, it's the most innovative Crab Beehoon I have ever tried... It has the savoury seafood umami, don't be surprised to find salted fish and Chinese herb dang gui in it, amazing cocoction, super fresh & firm crab meat 👍👍👍. Must try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aHNfWW1BRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,Traditional Zhi Cha at an industrial area coffee shop. Huge space and the food are good but no air-con.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPemFhLUVnEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,"Location is relatively convenient. The restaurant(the setting is actually a canteen in the day and restaurant by night) occupancy rate was ~70% during my visit. Reckon the food was slightly above average but the bill was HIGHLY about average (you probably would prefer a better setting, in air conditioned environment with the price you paid). Parking is always an issue over there... so,  go early if you need a slot. As for the waitresses... not that friendly if i may compare against my previous patronage. Generally, still an OK place to go for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNVlUM0JnEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,I came here over few occasions always ordered their signature dishes. This time just pick few dishes from the menu. All turn out good if not better than other restaurants. The fried baby squid is one of the better one. Ordered a deep fried sea bass HK style. We thought is $28/kg but it was $28 for the fish. Good value.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdk9UaTB3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,Me and my wife was scouting for a great crab place around amk. This shop did not disappoint me at all. Even tho we did not order crab ( because we wanted to test those other dishes first) we will definitely be back for the crab.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaWJqSFh3EAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Nice food if u are in the area, toilet is abit old school."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c0puZFdBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Relaxed atmosphere. Despite the full house, service was prompt and food arrived fairly quickly. Food was prepared well. The carpark valet service was a plus indeed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla3UzaVN3EAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,1,"Dishonest and low quality food. Don’t waste your time. We asked for red grouper. They gave us a black/pearl grouper instead and still charged us $76 for the fish. Total was $92 and fish was not even fresh.

First and last time eating here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X1lPZ3ZnRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"The $80+ crab was huge, full of eggs and very fresh. The mantous were had an almost crispy skin and soft white insides. The kai lan was yummy, not old, soft not chewy. The cereal prawns were large and fleshy. Overall, definitely a recommend. Only thing is the chilli crab gravy loses out to the one at Casuarina Rd."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcWRxRGRBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,Food was excellent and service was great too. Staff very friendly and accommodating. They also took steps to ensure safe distancing. Parking is little hard but they offer free valet which is a huge plus. Will definitely be back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcm9lVkZBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"My favourite dishes : Coffee Pork Ribs and Jing Long Chai. 5 stars for these 2 dishes.

A non air-conditioned food court in an industrial park but never felt warm or stuffy here.

Overall 4 stars because they often forget to serve us our food when it is crowded and need to keep reminding them. Happened a few times for the many times we dined there.

But will still go again and again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdlBYQ3FRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Surprising find for us - was looking for bak kut Teh rather than zi char last for dinner. However we were not disappointed by this choice!

The steamed sharks head was of course, the highlight of the night. The taste of the 99.9% collagen based filing was excellent. The rest of the dishes, were good - and the overall cost was only S$85."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5M2ViWjd3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,"Old fashion zi char place, crowded 2 days before CNY, guess many are having shou gong fan there.

The ambient is ok, normal coffee shop style, just much bigger in space.

The dishes order were mostly tasty, except salted fish sprouts (which I didn’t spot any salted fish) and braised tofu (which didn’t look or taste super appetising).

Nevertheless, recommend three egg spinach, herbal chicken (the soup was really good), wok hey hor fan!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLWJDYmNBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Tasty zichar.
Love the chilli gigantic crab and deep fried baby squid

They have great cook and their dishes are very savory even when the places are fully crowded, their standard of the food never fails!

Staffs are very attentive and polite. I would recommend for great cze char and various dishes are always my favourite.

Service Quality: 7/10
Food Quality: 8/10

Ambience: 6/10 (though its a coffeeshop, but it's very neat and clean)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUxLTTdnRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,1,"The food is really bad. Cereal prawn dish, the prawn not cooked. Served vegetables to wrong table and still wanted to serve the same dish to us. Rest of the food is below standard. The cleanliness of the coffeeshop is also really bad.  Won't be going again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dXZINDZ3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,Parking is still challenging even with their valet parking service on weekend. Price value is good.  Food is of zhi char standard . Some hit and misses
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdTdXcXZRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,Big place for dining. Friendly service staff but food are ordinary like any neighbourhood hor fan stall. Tea and coffee are good though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVeEtXY3p3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,My favourite place for crab tang hoon!! Crab us very fresh and often the meat at the legs are firm and juicy.. no kid. The tang hoon is cooked nicely with right amount of sauce firmness and yummy til the bottom of the clay pot.. if you know what I mean. The variety is plentiful and often a place for mid price family gatherings etc as they also serve roasted whole pig which they do themselves.. we also like the pork or fish sweet and sour since seperate.. parking is relatively easy too and on weekends they have valet..  enjoy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOS1INjRRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"It is my first time trying Buddha jump over the wall. You need at least 10 ppls and need to preorder in advance. Their other food dishes also not bad. In total, the cost for each person is about $100.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MGMyN3p3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Operated by a couple, serving lunch, not noticeable at this canteen, located near Eunos Industrial.
Ordered for a portion for 2 烧腊鸡饭、reasonable at $10."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3c3FLRjZBRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,Food is decent and prices are friendly. Didn't like the fact that you're forced to take their peanut and acai if you sit on tables with table cloth. Overall experience is good. Value for money. Bai mi fen is good
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncE5IYS1RRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,Large spacious and casual sitting. Mostly excellent hokkien style dishes. The crab bee hoon and nanru pork were especially good. The three egg veg could be better; not enough of the eggs. Service was prompt for a large restaurant. They even have valet parking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdjdTcDFRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Simple enbience. Food really above my expectation. Especially from Coffee Shop Zhi Char Stall. Service 4.8 out of 5 . The crabs are huge $68 per kilo That's the current price. Own by Mr. Lee. Quality of food and freshness are above standard. Worth my try to travel from Jurong to Ang Mo Kio.
Overall prices reasonable worth eating

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVXzg2VHN3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Industrial area in AMK for Zi-Char. Their chilli crab was a little spicy though, but nice and very fresh. Well cooked too. Reservations recommended"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURna0x2Q0pBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"The food was rather tasty. Personally I liked the water chestnut fritters, crab tang hoon ($60/kg during this Chinese New Year period - you can call and ask about the crab price before going down), and definitely the yam dessert!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrd2FTa2h3RRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,This place may be located in an industrial estate but it is strategically located at the junction of AMK Ave 10 and Ind Pk as well as directly opposite Pathlight School. The best dish is the suckling pig. Mama Mia! So yummilious!  The crab was so well done and the crab sauce very good too. The rest of the dish were just very delicious and finger licking good. The price is worth it. The place was well patronized even on a weekday.  That showed the quality of the food and the ambience was just right. They even have a public announcement system to inform cars that are blocking others.  Great place to be! Great Job to the chef and servers alike.😁
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvME9yb29RRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Dinner for 3... Hotplate tofu was good, sauce is different from the usual. Prawn paste chicken was tasty! The salted veg duck soup serving was generous. Orh Nee was a let down. Wasn’t fragrant..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNEtQN3FBRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,The zichar here is by far one of the best I have ever eaten. The quality of the food is quite good and affordable and the portion is just nice for 3 pax. We ordered the 咸菜鸭汤 which comes in a very big portion - easily good for a group of 6. The dessert orh ni is quite a let down though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvd2Jpb09REAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,3,"This mixed tofu is good, taste of lard. Salted vege soup is appetising to me. Vege is huge disappointed, too oily. I was there for Chinese New year dinner, their staple food like yee fu noodle and Vietnamese fried rice is good, but other dishes is horrible, fail in presentation and taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbnVuTG9BRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,"Food was good, service was quick and responsive. Friendly and helpful staff."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3aHRqMHVBRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,The pork ribs herbal Italian is good. Prices are reasonable. Food is yummy!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3N3Zmb013EAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,One of my family's favourite restaurants. We always enjoy the food here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLXViYzJRRRAB,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,4,"Food is good and price is reasonable. Except can be crowded during special days, when reservation is required. And they serve only set menu during such special days"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbTZDUUtBEAE,Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant,5,Crab is super big and at affordable price. Kian Seng is also super generous with the chilli crab sauce as can be seen from photo. Will totally come back again for more!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcDVDVS1nRRAB,Chang Cheng,3,"Food - decent range of choices. Economy rice, Zi Char, Western. Have tried the ZiChar and the JWS western. The western is recommended.
Ambience - Coffee shop
Price - $."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN3VhSGZREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Decent cafe food. Outdoor area is pet-friendly, no pets allowed indoors. Their chicken waffle dish is worth a try! Can get pretty crowded with family and kids during dinner hours. Overall nice ambience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcHQ3V0FnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday afternoon for lunch, not much crowd on a weekday. This cafe is quite spacious, have an outdoor and indoor seating area. I ordered the Chicken waffles Chicken was tender and delicious. The only complain was quite warm indoor, seem like the air-conditional is not working. Overall, wonderful place to chill and will visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHZXdU9nEAE,Cava Singapore,5,First time coming to this cafe and will definitely go back again. It’s such a nice and comfortable place to chill in..The food is nice & My family simply love all the varieties that we have ordered.. 👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzQtbk1nEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited them on consecutive Sat and Sun! Service staffs are friendly and polite. Ordered their mushroom risotto and truffle fries for both days. It was really good! Amazingly, their coffee was a gem for us. We didn’t have high expectations on their coffee yet it was the star for our brunch. The sea salt caramel latte was da bomb! Not sweet yet very smooth and produce good aroma of the coffee. Will bring our kiddos back for the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeThEMjBRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"It's new !!! Have outdoor (pets allowed) and indoor seating. Nice, clean, spacious and cosy. Ordered the all day breakfast set which was tasty and a cafe latte. Will visit again. Only complain was the need to improve their online menu with picture of the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGREUzRnRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,We were here for the vet's appt and was so glad for a cafe that welcomes little friends. Better than that the food is very good. The pasta was fresh yet light. We also had the croffles with a very crispy chicken. I would have stayed longer for dessert but with the current humidity we have to come back when we can sit indoors without the little friend. Very good dining experience and good offering of wines too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDY2WnN3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday for brunch, was a nice and quiet place to chill. Really enjoyed the pasta, which is a recommended dish . Quite a decent amount of seafood (scallops, prawns, clams) given 👍🏼👍🏼"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHVPSlBnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,A nice cafe tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Consists of both indoor air conditioned and outdoor seating suitable for pet owners which is a plus. Ample seating space inside as the restaurant stretches quite far in. Service is good and relatively fast. Decor is pretty and they have interesting pieces of furniture and contrasting wallpapers and panels for a varied effect. Tried their speculoos latte and Peter’s Pancake which is quite good 👍😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPME1heGRBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Pretty good food and service at reasonable prices. The rosti waffles were very delicious, although we wish they could be even crispier. Pancakes are fluffy, scrambled egg is creamy, bacon is not too greasy. The melon tea smells very calming although the melon taste itself wasn't very strong. The online ordering platform was missing photos for several items, which made it hard to visualize what the dish would look like or the portion size.

Relaxing simple decor. The outdoor area is pet-friendly, lotsa cute dogs there! Indoors has plenty of seating. There is also a small garden area on the other end, with goldfishes swimming around in a little rock fountain."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnZxRzVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"Wow.. love this place for its space... wide spacious and hippy green ambience... Nice!

Simply the space and deco makes this cafe super comfortable to laze and chill in.

And I'm glad the great food goes well with ambience too..

Been here twice already. And their pastas and burger is great!

And their online loyalty program is definitely tempting me to go back a 3rd 4th time...
And its only tempting because food and ambience is great..

Would definitely be back many more times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3UzRUpBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Found a nice new cafe. Great food, pet friendly and can cycle over the next round. Just a bit longer waiting time for a seat so better to book advance 🥂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTlyQ21RRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"My first attempt lunch experience.

Personally, I like their main menu items, the savoury items are not to my liking.

Overall dining experience is good. Nice place and ambient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyekxpSkxnEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Strong contender to the existing upper Thomson road cafes like Columbus Coffee. Overall good brunch food, with nice platting and interior design. However could do better with their coffees (quite awful Americano). They should like consider providing better utensils (fork,soon) as the current ones are obviously of sub standard quality, similar to the ones we see in food court. It’s the non polished type and didn’t look or feel sparkling clean. Furthermore, all of their fork has stains between the grooves. Asked for change but all had stains. Ended up not using their fork. Lost my appetite a little. Chicken was great but wished they drained the excess oil before serving. The plate was filled with excess oil from the chicken midway during meal. Overall 3 stars with lots of potential for improvement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1ozQkRBEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Good food and pet friendly. Will visit again
Not bad for a 3 week old cafe 🙂

Update:
Went back on their 4th week of business with more friends. Waiting time improved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGFxeXhRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"A bright, beautiful, and spacious cafe with lots of greenery - reminds me of a laidback Balinese beach club/cafe. It has a open, pet-friendly outdoor seating area too!

Not your usual cafe fare, ordered a few unique items to try. They were all delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzhHM0hREAE,Cava Singapore,3,"This cafe is pretty near my place but first time trying. Reservations is recommended especially for weekends. Surprised that the indoor dining area was so big.
Found the price of the food quite expensive. Breakfast for 3 easily exceeded $100. They had a promo with Citibank but we had lots of problems with it as it couldn't accept applepay or if the credit card is stored inside the phone without the full 16 digits.
Order a few dishes to share, the one we enjoyed most is the Chicken and Croffles. Both croffles and chicken were well cooked. The Roffles platter was interesting because of the rosti waffles and also liked the way the mushrooms were cooked.
Service was very slow. Not sure if they forgot the order or what. The staff are all very young and had to call them over a few times to check the status of the dishes. The sides came almost last, the Spicy Chicken wasn't really nice it didn't taste Korean but the sauce more tasted like the Thai sweet Chili sauce. The Sakura Cream Tagliatelie also came late and serving was very small which left us unsatisfied.
Drinks were just pretty average.
Really need to improve on the speed of the food served. Not sure why the cafe wasn't even crowded at all early in the morning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0tDckJ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Lovely ambience and tasty albeit junky food, has a nice al fresco area for pet owners and their fur kids. Deep fried chicken and croffles very yummy. Fries were good too. We'll be back soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b0lxNmlBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Loved the interior design and spacious. Also has an outdoor sheltered seating area. Our group of 3 had the croffles with fried chicken, the crispy chicken burger, the rosti with mushrooms & pork sausages, chicken tenders with korean spicy sauce - all of them were decently good. The letdown came in the form of their tarts where the crust was soft, and it just felt liked it was kept for too many days."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGFMT2JREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited the place on a weekday afternoon and was delighted that there’s no crowd. Huge space with ample seating area. Had the fried chicken, sakura pasta and the creamed corn (CCB).

The pasta and chicken were great but the corn was just alright. The sour cream was not a good addition to the corn. Drinks were on the expensive side too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM0lXVzNRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Didn't expect the food to be good, but it really is! The chef does fried chicken super well. We ordered the spicy Korean fried chicken it was out of this world. The CCB is also super yummy. The CAVA burger is huge but also very tasty. My husband and I were stuffed after these three dishes due to the generous portion of the CAVA burger. For the portion, the price is very reasonable. The downside is the waiting time, it took 40 mins for us to have the first side on the table. We had to approach the service staff to check on our order. The last dish, the burger took 1 hour. Service staff is quite friendly and attentive in terms of refilling water. Easy to get their attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc0tLQ1R3EAE,Cava Singapore,2,"The colors they utilized in their interior design were fantastic. The colors are black, white, and jade green. This is a fantastic mix. I went on a Friday night when it wasn't too packed. ⁣

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2FMcGxBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Here for brunch and dinner before. The otah bruschetta with grilled cheese is a must. Dinner menu is so-so, portion can be bigger even though the food is good. Love the place as it allowed furkid to accompany the hoomans under shelter. Nice cafe in a quiet estate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnNmR2pnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"May 2022: This cafe has really good potential. Love the space - bright and spacious. Food was also good. Order the Cava Burger (chicken thigh) and the wild mushroom pasta. Both delicious. I liked how the cheese was melted on the bun and the mushrooms in the chicken burger. There is an option to choose wagyu meat instead of chicken for $2 additional but I read about how good the fried chicken was and hence was not about to lose this opportunity to taste it! Was happy I didn’t! Anyway, I wonder how the burger which included a slice of pineapple would taste if I had chose wagyu!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1B1SmZnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"5 stars service, staff very patient and polite. They have special food and drink. Delicious and satisfying. The pet friendly zone is spacious without worrying about rain or hot weather."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2FhaVp3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,"It's a spacious cafe with welcoming staff. Ordered the mentaiko fries - which was great for sharing. The salmon was well executed but we didnt really appreciate the rosti. Overall, its a nice find in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaUw3WUxBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Love the recommended dishes : Sakura Tagliatelle, Cava Burger. Food is really good, best part I can get to see beautiful fur patrons playing at the outdoor area. Didn't enjoy the lemon meringue tart though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a09EVUZ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great neighbourhood cafe with brunch food. Rather big space lots of seating outside and inside. We ordered the fried chicken and croffles, mentaiko fries and the mushroom risotto.

The fried chicken was really well battered, light and crispy and not oily. The coleslaw was also a really nice touch cause I’m not a fan of putting maple syrup on my savoury food. I would say a must try when you come here.

The mushroom risotto was everything you would want in a risotto dish. Simple and rice was cooked just right (slightly Al dente but cooked through).

Mentaiko fries were decent but nothing special.

You order and pay through a QR code which is always a plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldDhUbDZBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"We came here after seeing Daniel Food Diary’s review (though we know to take all the bloggers’ reviews with a big pinch of salt).

In a nutshell, the food here is decent. Just skip the desserts and the coffee (which is a collaboration with local Hook coffee but the cafe does not have a barista in house). After lunch, simply hop over to Thus Coffee which is just around the corner.

It’s nice, quiet and spacious spot for catching up over lunch. On a Monday noon, it wasn’t crowded at all. We had a nice far end spot where behind the doors is the backyard with a water well.

We ordered the otah bruschetta (sourdough), seafood aglio olio, fishy business (salmon), roffles platter and wild mushroom risotto. All of us rather enjoyed our respective main course.

Thereafter, we shared the ondeh ondeh cake, yuzu cheesecake and a warm apple crumble and also had cups of coffee.

The Apple crumble looked really funky and unnatural (take a look at the last photo) plus it was too sweet. The ondeh ondeh was nothing to rave about either. Coffee was served without inspiration (no latte art cos as mentioned, no barista) - it was just bland, normal coffee but at a barista price tag of $7."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNThPX3lnRRAB,Cava Singapore,3,"Do reserve before going especially on a weekend as it can get packed.

First visit - Order didn't go through the online ordering system and we ended up waiting for awhile to realise it didn't go through. But technical fault, can't be helped. Anyway, reordered and our food came in adequate time. The spinach cream pasta was quite nice.

Second visit - Decided to try the otah, and sakura pasta. Interesting menu, both were alright.

In both visits, the drinks were slightly underwhelming. Nice atmosphere and staff though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb19iNUFREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went there for lunch recently for a family of 5. Overall food is nice and the service is good. However, and that is a HUGE but, the waiting time for the food is ridiculously long at 70 minutes after ordering!!

They did let us know that waiting time for food will be at 30 minutes or more. I think it is good that they let customers know that they need to wait. Hmm... but we waited for 70 minutes... AND even if there is lots of pre-warning or notification that food may take some time to prepare, waiting for 70 minutes for the food is not acceptable. They really need to look into streamlining the process or expanding the kitchen capacity to have faster turn around time.

Apart from that, please do make reservation ahead! With such a long turn around time from ordering food to serving, you don't want to be queueing outside waiting for table + waiting for food later!

The service of this place is good. There are many attentive young servers.

Food wise, it is tasty and unique. Some notable dishes are the Spinach Creatm Tagliatelle ($15), Seafood Aglio Olio ($15),  CCB (Cream Corn Bacon $9). We ordered quite a lot of other stuff too. Can look at the photos. Food wise, it is 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNXRDYmVnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Beautiful interior and very spacious, quiet on thurs evening. Food was veryyyy average. Melon tea by the pot, teabag type. Speculoos Cafe Latte was good because its totally not sweet at all though the name. Roffles Platter was very homemade... the roffles was not crispy and abit mushy. Sakura Cream Tagliatelle Pasta was below average, too much residue water from the seafood so the whole dish was very watery but the prawns were fresh. Seafood Aglio Olio was average. Fries with truffle & parmesan was good, very generous and huge serving, highly recommend. Visited this cafe to celebrate a friend's birthday so we also ordered a Lemon Meringue Tart which didnt taste fresh, below average.

Will recommend this place only for small bites and drinks. Good for a teatime break."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaU9XbERREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great all-day brunch and coffee. I had the open faced wagyu sandwich and my wife tried the Rosti waffle platter which is gluten free. Both are well presented and tasty. It is cavernous inside with lots of space and good ambience. Pets are allowed in their outdoor seating, which is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0tpcnVBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,A really spacious cafe newly opened just months ago. Comfortable and cosy seating.. serving great pasta towards the Asian texture. Love❤️ the small portions available for the small eaters🥰 #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcC1lQUhBEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Was looking for coffee after dinner and stumbled upon this cafe. Big and spacious dinning area. There is also a huge alfresco dinning area where you can bring your pets along. Very comfortable environment. At around 9+pm was still quite crowded on a Friday nite.

Cafe pricing is on the pricier side for this order. Drinks are quite unique. Ordered the iced puffed rice cafe latte and a hot speculoos cafe latte.

Puffed rice went quite well with the latte adding some texture. Giving a cereal feel when it is soaked up with latte. Recommended to try. Speculoos latte is ok but hope that they can be more generous with the speculoos topping.
Cheesecake is average.

Nice place to chill after dinner. Will be back to try their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnRLekl3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,Came with hubby and kids on Sunday late afternoon . Kids and pets friendly . Quite a busy cafe at that hour so I think quite suitable for noisy kids to dine in . Ambience was great as I faced to a small tropical garden ! Love the plants especially for plant lovers . haha . I think chicken croffle was not bad-recommended . English BF and spam fries soso. Cappucino can be better ( quite bitter ) as I think the other cafe around the corner has better coffee . I was expecting better coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ2ZiYnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Great ambience, nice deco plus 5 stars for presentation! Melted nacho cheese dripped over the entire Wagyu burger served with fries. Lovely idea. Was expected a patty but it was yakiniku Wagyu but I'm not complaining cos it was well done. Impressive. Just didn't like that fries served was only warm, likely fried and put aside for quite a while. Waffle and chicken wasn't that fantastic according to my lunch companion. But still, decent for sure. Wash it all down with a pint for a wonderful dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDc2NkZREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Celebrated Father’s Day here. Coming here to try the food because it’s recommended by danielfooddiary. The food is fantastic. We tried the otah bread, ice latte, croffle chicken & seafood pasta. Price wise is $20 ish per pax. Ambience is good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNFoyUnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,Pet friendly cafe in a quiet neighborhood. Quality of food is better than expected but selection range not wide- wish they have more desserts choices~
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaUxDWlNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Had the mushroom linguine, mentaiko fries and spinach pasta. Enjoyed all of them. Portion size was good, mentaiko was very flavourful and had a torched flavour. Mushroom linguine had a generous amount of mushrooms and they were cooked well without too much of an earthy taste.

Could improve the acoustics in the restaurant though as there were not many people but it was very noisy. Good place to hold events but if it's so echoey it will not be conducive.

Do check out the well. It had a few dead leaves though. And the door to the back garden was locked.

Also there was a super smiley server, she was really cheerful, wish all servers were like her."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM09qcXRRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Good cafe, good choice of items/menu and friendly staff. Prices very acceptable for this area as well. We had the chicken croffles and the otah bruschetta, both tasted really good. Don't know what it is, but it's just missing the x-factor for a five star review."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM1BiRWRREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Food is ok and environment is good. Nice outdoor place for people who wants to bring their pets over to chill.

This places serves western food. Can get pretty crowded and noisy during dinner times.

A little far from MRT, but this place is worth the distance.

Will definitely come back here for more next time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLU5ycUNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Food is very yummy, and place is very bright and roomy. The croffle and chicken was a big hit with everyone, and I loved the chicken burger as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3NHTjFBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"C.C.B was my favourite dish! Head down to the cafe to find out what I mean 😉

Attracted to the amazing ambience of this cafe! I highly recommend all of you to have a sense of it too!

- Food; EXCELLENT!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️ The food display was exquisite, the food taste just as pleasant as how it looks (I took video instead of photos, cant post it)

- Chill outdoor; can bring your pet along, I saw one doggo 😍 (it’s open 24/7 according to one of the bosses)

- Cozy indoor; the furnishing of the cafe felt like I was in a HIGH END restaurant with affordable food, there are high chairs, sofas, and other different types of sitting to choose from (closes at 10-10.30pm)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjZMYmdnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Location: Pet friendly cafe located near a vet, a small park, catsmart, petlovers, and a nearby cafe to chill with your pooches after having a walk at lower pierce reservoir, ample parking.

Cafe: Came here a few times. Cafe is very spacious for small and big groups but price wise is a bit on the high side. I find a cup of cappuccino at $7 quite exp. Got the caramelized (coffee with a whip of caramel at $8). Food is acceptable & bug portion but not so fantastic. Service is very good, staff will immediately ask a choice of cold or warm water, and provide a water for the pooch too. We'll come back for small bites and some drinks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWNiVnZRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Interesting place to dine at a hidden corner. It has a “secret” garden that’s quite cool too with mist timing. Food is nice and ambiance is cosy, clean and spacious. 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHB1SXVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"The cafe is very Instagramable , it’s nice for chill out n photo n meeting up with friends , beer r very affordable price .
Owners r friendly couple
Chicken is too small portion size can be improved, maybe add more vege to make it feel more worth it , we prefer smth that is bigger portion. Coffee is a little bitter , can be improved.
The English breakfast cauliflower is not really fantastic, it will be better if u can change it to mash potatoes or sweet corn or potatoes salad . The bread is too thin n small it will be better if u guys can change to a thicker one . Taste wise is perfect . Like a 4 star restaurant. Thumbs up owner ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNkxLS0RREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Nice and spacious cafe in the quiet Sembawang Hills with friendly staff. Seems to be pet-friendly with many customers with dogs out front.

Had typical cafe food with some interesting twists e.g. Nacho Cheese on Wagyu Burger, Rose Matcha Latte. However feels slightly pricy, even for a cafe, (~$20), especially if you order cmmon cafe food

Would recommend to try if you're in the area, and get the more special foods on the menu (like Otah Bruschetta) instead of things like the typical American Breakfast set."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGRLZFR3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,Spacious restaurant with a modern deco. Attentive and prompt service. Good food.with little pleasant surprises.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWU2WVpBEAE,Cava Singapore,2,"Pet-friendly place. I wouldn’t say it’s fantastic or novel but I tried it because of the good reviews. The otah bruschetta was thin and laid on top of a slice white bread. It’s quite hard to cut and dry. In terms of spiciness and taste, I’ll rate it 2/5. In the end, i grab it with my hands and eat it. I don’t think it’ll order it again because it’s not worth $18 (add $2 for cheese topping). Coffee is so-so ($7 up)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajdiT3l3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a Thursday evening and the space was quiet and serene! A lot of space between tables which made it a plus for an already dog friendly establishment. Service staff were attentive and responsive. Ordered three mains: Sakura ebi tagliatelle, seafood aglio olio and a small breakfast plate, found them all to be nice! Hot latte was also good! But apple crumble was very disappointing cos it was soft and mushy, hence minus one star!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaHNEdVJREAE,Sinar malay seafood,5,"Ordered from Foodpanda.

The curry fish head is soo goooddd….the thick, flavorful, creamy, spicy curry compliments the sweet and juicy fish so well. Comes with some eggplant, taupok, and some vegs.

Their veg and omelette is nice too.

Don’t be mislead by the ugly photo I took. It’s 100% worth the try 🤩"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtalpQS3VRRRAB,Sinar malay seafood,1,My kind advice to everyone is do not order from them via foodpanda or grab delivery. For $12.30 this is what you will get. I am regular to this store and they had been generous before. Till recently they have been ripping of your money with little portion. Recently they have increased some of their food price. Which I understand due to some raw material increase in price they have to make some adjustments. But reducing the portion with higher price is daylight robbery. There must be some business ethics when running a business. Recently they have been greedy only. This will be my last order..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5M2FDdU5REAE,Sinar malay seafood,3,"Had dinner here with a friend, order beancurd on hotplate and steam fish. The beancurd was good but the fish was lacking. As my friend cannot take spicy food so ended up choosing the non spicy cooking. Price wise decent, payment type they take grab pay."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcjR1aUxBEAE,Sinar malay seafood,2,"Ordered the chilli crab and cereal prawns based on reviews I saw on Food Panda. Portions were decent though they are priced high. However, the crab and prawns was not fresh at all! It’s as though they used frozen crabs, as the meat was very dry, whilst the prawn meat was tasteless. The chilli crab gravy tasted alright. Overall disappointing. For the price paid $50/crab, you’d expect better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtenBpa1hBEAE,Sinar malay seafood,5,I ordered fried kway teow with cockles through grab app. It’s very delicious. Cockles are very well cooked and no fishy. They added lots of red chilli for me as I requested. Will definitely order again. Thank you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3ZPMzBBRRAB,Sinar malay seafood,1,One crab cost $50+ and did not taste good. The pepper crab that I ordered was of poor standard and disappointing! Waste of money!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMU5fbGVnEAE,Sinar malay seafood,5,"Didn't really think the food here would be that good but I was pleasantly surprised!

Price isn't too crazy on par with typical Chinese seafood shops, but the quality is on point.

I truly enjoyed some of their dishes, namely the mee goreng, Sambal Kang Kong, Cereal Prawns and even the fried rice! Nice big portions and well worth the amount that you pay.

I would highly recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood, or you can get it on Grab/Deliveroo/Foodpanda as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbDhyNnNBRRAB,Sinar malay seafood,5,"I have been a customer at the Jurong West coffeeshop and moved to Yishun now. I really liked their Thai wings, sweet & sour fish, fried rice and kung po chicken at Jurong West. At Yishun I really like their Tom Yum seafood soup, Mee Goreng seafood, Thai style chicken (it's all about the sauce) and  prawn paste chicken! Looking forward to trying more dishes! Really tasty food!"

BUT NOT THIS TIME
ordered stingray fr 2 pax $15
I am always super fine wf not cheap food as long as it does justice
Stingray is super small like 2 small slices and super duper dry n hard to chew :-(
Cockles costing me $9 for 15pcs is half cooked n cant swallow too cos despite chewing few times it is still a whole chunk
Paid $26 for 2 rice, 15pcs cockles & 2 small slices ray, it is a disappointment experience

Eat at yr own high hopes !"

Uncle friendly and straightforward guy, but most importantly his hands are fast. No need to queue so long. Try it when you are around. :)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaC1mWDR3RRAB,Penang Delights,4,"Each bowl of Lor Mee comes with braised egg, pork slice, Kang Kong and fish cakes. Thick starchy and flavoursome broth is ladled onto springy yellow noodles. With their homemade chilli sauce and vinegar, the Lor Mee tastes as good as it looks, makes you want to go back for more.

Prawn Mee was equally delicious as well. Soup had distinct a rich flavour and pleasant aroma. Every sip of the soup, will open up your appetite more and I just couldn’t stop indulging. Definitely a great choice for a quick and delicious brunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdEs3QUZBEAE,Penang Delights,4,"Tried this famous prawn noodle stall last weekend. The broth was really good, rich and not too overpowering. The highlight I would say is the chilli. Gave a good kick for me! The prawns were fresh too, but 2 seems a bit little, an extra one would be better! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXM1p6R3pBRRAB,Penang Delights,5,"This prawn mee remind me of my childhood. At Malaysia, KL, Jalan cheras, there is one prawn mee stall at the road side. I have always missed this taste.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc012QUJBEAE,Penang Delights,1,"Long time nv eat.... since my sec sch days today my friend say feel like eating prawn noodles so i thought of them.. thought of eating this again....

Note order takeaway note they pack 1 plain soup is $2

Note they dont give u any soya with red chilli if want must ownself take / pack and ownself take also no carrier. U want u just take and throw inside ur noodle 😂. Maybe business too good. But im never returning here again. ( btw i run a noodle business too and i understand cost is increasing but $2 for plain soup and its not even the b1000 standard size its the smallest avail dessert container size 😅...and dont have a 0.013cents carrier for chili padi is ridiculous)

If u can accept all of the above then can consider takeaway.... if u eating there maybe need pay $1 for soup? Since takeaway is $2"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aXViOE5nEAE,Penang Delights,5,"After eating the prawn mee here, you will not want to eat any other prawn mee! I sometimes even have cravings for the prawn mee here! I love the dry version, which comes with dried deshelled prawns. (Will add extra vinegar) It comes with a bowl of soup at the side, which I will pour into my dry noodles when I'm almost done with my meal, mixing the soup with the sauces of the dry noodle. So I get best of both worlds! If u prefer fresh prawns, order the soup version and peel the prawn shell yourself. Haha. OK. I'm drooling now...
They also serve lor mee
AND a mix of both lor mee and prawn mee in 1 dish of u can't decide which to have and can't finish 2 bowls on your own.
Boss lady advised to call to check if you want dry version later part of the day, as the dried prawn always sold out early."

Mouth- 'Full' of taste with thick gravy that seems to coat each strain of noodles! The chilli isn't over powering, subtly spice up the taste, simply making it perfect.
I had issue ordering online and the owner is so kind to look into for me.
My craving fulfilled! You should have yours too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNDZMb0hBEAE,Penang Delights,5,"Found this place on Google map. The broth of the prawn noodle is good ( a little sweeter compare to SG prawn noodle ).

Although taste diff a little but still good, especially the specially homemade dry prawn, fantastic, you can’t find it elsewhere.
The only thing is the noodle price has been increased over time and time, not so affordable to fill an empty stomach.
But no choice if you have a craving.
Inflation and rent cost is real."

The lor mee was tasty and the prawn noodle broth rich in flavor.

It's only 4 stars cos it's a hawker centre"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJaTk2a1NBEAE,Penang Delights,4,"I grew up eating the Penang versions of prawn noodle soup and lor mee at this stall. The broth is extremely rich with the use of tons of prawn heads and shells I believe. If you want to try something different, order the dry prawn noodles with small prawns. The tiny prawns have been deshelled and cooked down to a shrivel but they are really delicious. If you upsize your order, you also get to enjoy some slices of lor bak and lor ng(egg) along with the prawns.
As for the lor mee, I always prefer bee hoon and upsized so that I get to enjoy more of the really well braised lor bak and a whole egg. Just typing this is making me drool again😁"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeDcteDBBRRAB,Penang Delights,4,"V good hokkien prawn mee, v close to penang style. Wish soup can be less sugar. Perhaps thanks to his efficient helper hired recently, owner seems more chill, never scold customers already. Price recently increased but understandable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb19DM2p3RRAB,Penang Delights,5,It’s the best prawn noodles I had in Singapore. Totally must try!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtM0xxczFBRRAB,Penang Delights,4,"Whenever I crave for penang prawn noodles, I would be here. The portion is good for the price, the prawns are always fresh, the broth is flavourful and robust and the chilli elevates the taste. Yummy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb0pMcThnRRAB,Penang Delights,5,"The Soup is a little sweet, but it balanced well with the chilli. It may not be the best I've had, but there's things I really love about it. They use the Ipoh Hor fun kind of kuay Teow rather then the usual big ones, very smooth and goes well with the broth. They even peel the middle sections of the prawns, for this I gave 1 more star. I love prawn heads, and most places you will need to deshell yourself if there's head intact, or they served totally deshelled prawn. It's a lot more work to peel only the middle section, for this I'll definitely come back for more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OGJ2cmR3EAE,Penang Delights,5,The prawn noodle is superb and taste authentic like Penang one. Recommended !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJb3RqenVnRRAB,Penang Delights,3,It’s a kind of sweet tasting soup. Chili sauce wasn’t quite what I expected. A bit too citrusy. Overall not quite the same as Penang hokkein mee in Penang. It’s an interesting take though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbDcyb2xBRRAB,Penang Delights,1,"I have gone to this stall since I was young. In my latest visit today, I realised that the uncle has increased the price from $5.5 to $7.5 (L). I thought knowing the uncle for so long, I made a friendly remark that he has increased the price again. To my horror, he started scolding (very fiercely) at me, angrily returned my money and brushed me off telling me not to come back anymore in future. I knew all along this uncle has been rather rude to his customers but little did I expect that on myself. It says a lot about a person to drive a customer off in this manner, let alone a loyal customer for so long. Honestly, there are many other very good penang prawn mee around. He has lost me and my family forever."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpX0l5VHhBRRAB,Penang Delights,1,"Soup is rich and tasty, but uncle was extremely rude. I queued up at 12:30 pm (lunch time) and ordered 4 portions of prawn mee to go. He told me in chinese language that 4 portions will jam up the queue behind me and shouted to the 3 people behind ‘you got to wait because she ordered 4 portions’. I felt embarrassed. Now looking back, shouldn’t you expect such orders in the F and B industry? Are you sure you want to treat your patrons who support your business this way? Such an attitude was off-putting and destroyed my appetite. I would not be buying my prawn mee from this place again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtalo2MFNREAE,Penang Delights,3,"Fried kway teo is not Penang style more local style, fried with sweet sauce and Chinese sausage. Chendol not using fresh coconut milk. Disappointing :("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJeXFUV0RREAE,Penang Delights,4,"Like it's Penang Prawn mee, the taste is nice, but the amount of mee is less/not enough.. The prawn is consider big size.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRc3NYQUF3EAE,Penang Delights,4,"Nice prawn broth and lor mee. Boss gets frustrated when business is good. Don't expect service ok. Order, eat and go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMkpPdDVRRRAB,Penang Delights,1,"I don’t understand why so many people giving positive comments on their prawn mee! I went to try for the 1st time after reading those positive reviews, sadly to say it is overrated, soup is too oily and lack of prawn taste! Will never buy again! The best Penang prawn mee I ever tried so far is located at amk hub malaysia boleh!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHazdEMkdBEAE,Penang Delights,5,"Rich taste lor mee. Overall is great. Prawn noodle is okay, I think it will taste better if add a bit of lor mee soup"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHJydjhRRRAB,Penang Delights,5,This stall is a hidden gem! Their soup has incredible flavor. Try the dishes with bee hoon. You won't regret it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeV9HYlBREAE,Penang Delights,5,"I love the prawn noodles there. Soup is rich and sweet with spice. I understand some may said Uncle attitude isn't good. But for me, I just order, eat n zhao. So don't think too much on that, he won't even remember you if you come once awhile like me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRZ3ZHNkhnEAE,Penang Delights,5,No kidding.. this is really really good.. and to think that I've been here for the lor mee all this while really triggers me! The Penang Prawn Noodles is da bomb!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdjViMV93RRAB,Penang Delights,5,One of my fav Penang style yuenyang (lor mee + prawn mee) ! Standard has been consistent over the past 10 years
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbzVmaEJBEAE,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Delicious food at an affordable price, with a good variety of options. Only issue is finding a seat during peak meal times, and about ten minutes wait for the more popular stalls. Otherwise, it's one of my favourite places to grab a quick meal either alone or in a small group."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1emN2NTdnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,3,"Chilli Pan Mee is the stall with consistent quality. The noodle is special which is not commonly seen here, thicker but not hard. When everything tossed together, u will appreciate the overall texture and taste. Oyster omelette is not oily but sweet instead of savoury. I would prefer more crispy crust. Curry noodle is average. Claypot rice has no smoky nor charred smell. Penang prawn mee is the least favourite as taste is quite bland. We always order chendol after meal but recently the price has increased so much."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDl1U0d3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,"My colleague recommended me wanton mee at Malaysia Boleh Jurong Point but its too far from my house. Decided to give Amk hub a shot and wasnt disappointed.

Sei Ngan Zai Wanton mee: my colleague said the noodle is nice, not the typical egg noodle but this is not the case at Amk outlet. Regardless, I enjoyed it because charsiew has the char taste, the soup is tasty with carrot and white cabbage, wanton is savoury and springy with big chunk of pork. Cost: $4.5.

Char Kway Teow ($5/$6.5): got no cockles at all. $5 for 2 prawn and small portion, its a bit expensive.

Ban mian: so so only, the onsen egg is nice though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNjhuel9BRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,3,"After all the hype, we tried this place out to avoid driving all the way to Jurong.

The food here is average at best. Jurong is better, at least from our last trip in Nov 2021.

The chendol is nothing like those in Penang or even any parts of Singapore. So it's bad. Skip it.

Charkoay teow was moist which is unlike Penang which is dryer.

Prawn mee was the only bright spot followed by KL Hokkien mee.

Didn't try out other dishes... Not sure if I want to waste my stomach space again there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdTdQNHV3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Delicious chilli ban mian. Initially I thought there's not enough chilli and sauce. But after stirring, each and every strand of the noodles was coated immensely with the sauce. There was pork lard to go with it too. It was marvellous. At $4.50 in this setting, it's very worth the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OXBpWGZREAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Rarely find char siew to be soft and juicy nowadays, all too lean and healthy, surprisingly good one from 四眼仔.
烧肉 also good, skin is crispy but doesn’t stick between teeth, good roast.
However sauce is too sweet for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ck9YM0ZREAE,Malaysia Boleh,3,"I came back for this bowl. Probably the only competent chili ban mee in the area. Toothsome noodles, topped up for extra veg and the amount was generous.

Unfortunately I won't be back save for at odd hours. Queue management is terrible for this stall. I wasn't given a buzzer or any indication of when my food might be ready, so I hovered at the counter, getting more and more demoralised with every order that wasn't mine. It's good but not enough to warrant a 20 mintue wait. There weren't enough seats on a weekday at lunch either.

Pandan waffle is dense and kueh like. That suits me fine. The blueberry spread is a no go unless you want diabetes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXYtdUV3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,"At B2 of AMK hub, same level as ntuc fairprice.

Many choices of local n malaysian food at reasonable pricing compared to other eateries in the mall.

Went in the afternoon at about 1. 30pm, quite crowded but was able to find a seat within 10mins.

Economical rice- About 20-30 different dishes to choose from.. The veg n meat we chose were delicious. $6.50

Fish soup- Ordered double fish soup. Soup is tasty, fish was also fresh. Opted to add milk.. $8

Would love to come back again to try other food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjhQa05BEAE,Malaysia Boleh,3,"Had the chai png today. While the 2 meats were good, the selection of vegetables was dismal.

The eatery is rather cramped up, so go during off-peak hours.

Would rate it as 3.5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNVBPbUdBEAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Lovely Malaysian fare which is pretty much as authentic as it gets! Their Assam Laksa is definitely worth eating, and comes with generous amounts of toppings.

Apart from Assam Laksa, do try their Char Kway Teow, Curry Yong Tau Foo Char Kway Teow and Claypot Rice. It’s really quite authentic and bound to hit your cravings for Malaysian food in the right spots!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb3J6UGF3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,This place is packed during meal times. Been here countless times. Most of the stalls are pretty good. You'll get your hawker food cravings fulfilled. My personal favourites are the claypot rice & char kway teow
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtalB5Ny13RRAB,Malaysia Boleh,1,"Many stalls only one staff doing cooking but they have 2 food sections. U need wait staff take turn to cook foods. Coffee is not hot  at all, most horrible coffee ever. Untrained staff? Used to a guy making coffee but today is a lady. Basic skill to make coffee minimum must be served hot!! So basic"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHek9fSlJ3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,5,My all time favorite chilli pan main. Not too spicy and oily. Everything just right and with the half bolied egg it exploded in your mouth. Must eat every time I'm here. Together I will always order the fish ball noodle. You could taste the difference from our Singapore style. The whole meal experience made it felt like you're in Malaysia. Missed going MY.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNHFtYWNnEAE,Malaysia Boleh,5,My go-to place for Assam Laksa. Love the BKT and Assam laksa better than any shop that served Malaysia food outside. Anyone who misses Malaysia food definitely should drop by for a try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM0wybTlnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Huge variety of Malaysian cuisine, don’t go too near to closing time, most of the time, they will not entertain your orders by saying they are closing soon. Some might be rude to you, but this is 100% authentic Malaysian experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldzVMMzFnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Always crowded near to, during or slightly after meal hours! Need to find a seat before going for an order. Tables are dirty as the cleaning staff are not doing their part to clear the plates and wipe the tables."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycFAzdmpRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,1,"Wafer was warm and crispy on the outside. Durian was the cheap kind, on the watery side, hardly any sweetness nor was it aromatic. And it was $6.80. Only went to try it because of some food blogger. And I wanted to believe it was good. Disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeDZldTFBRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Very nice piping hot claypot with dark sauce and sesame oil fragrance. Portion is generous with rice, chicken, Chinese sausage and salted fish. Those who love 锅巴will have lots to enjoy. The sambal chilli is very good too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2azh1QmR3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Having dinner at Malaysia Boleh, it is not the first time we have the fried kway teow, it comes with a little spicy taste, and that wok hei (wok thermal radiation) is really great! I have seen some stalls that they have the wok hei, but there is some portion of the food got burn. This stall did a good job on that, I dont see any burn on my food. It comes with bean sprout, spring onion green leaves, eggs and 2 median size  prawns! I prefer this spring onion to choy sum, as some times the choy sum might have a bitter taste, love it and will definitely come back again! ❤️
Waiting time is roughly about 15 minutes during 7pm on Saturday"

Great breakfast at Malaysia Boleh.
Please come later, like around afternoon for: FKT, KL hokkien mee, Hainansese chicken rice and many more.

Any food labelled KL, Penang, Malacca, Ipoh… I w eat. Missing these cities n the people very much."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bGZTOVlnEAE,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Located at B2 of AMK Hub, this foodcourt is a very crowded outlet. The food is nice and the price is quite reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2N3NiNWR3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,3,"Was excited to find Malaysia food court with good variety at amk hub. Unfortunately the taste can’t make it. Tried the KL fried Hokkien mee and it’s a horror. Worst noodle ever! Whole plate is super black, including the cabbage and prawns. You can’t even see/ tell they are there until you dig in (there are only very few pieces anyway) Taste is totally off!!! Anyone can fry a better plate of noodle than this!!!

The Penang prawn noodle looks more promising with the hard boiled egg, small shrimps fry in chili, sliced pork and soup with chili oil. Unfortunately the soup lacks flavour, just salty.

The apom is also disappointing, soggy with hardly any fillings. The best thing I found here is the crispy pancake. Yeah, probably the only thing worth eating here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNEk3UnV3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh,4,A place where you can get many of Malaysia’s delicacies! And of which are up to standard and expectation. Would recommend Chendol and the pork cutlet curry rice. Asam laksa is not bad too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbzVlN0N3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Lots of nice Msian foods here that can fix craving on Msian food. Curry chee cheong fun and dry chili pan mee is my all time favorite. Personally feel the apam balik is not that authentic, it tastes like a kuih kapit.."

Apparently it's a foodcourt concept set up by Feixiong, who owns many EATs at shopping mallls. The best is the Penang fried kuayteow, full of wokhei n uses Ipoh stubby bean sprouts, curry chicken beehoon is yummy, more flavourful than HongLim's lemak style. Hokkien prawn noodles and fishballs are great too. Rojak's sauce is very authentic Penang style.

Recently they have added curry chee cheong fun, quite authentic too"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa3JpV0xREAE,Malaysia Boleh,2,"This Malaysian themed food court offered a wide variety of food. However, the quality was rather below average. The bak kut teh had quite a generous amount of ingredients for $5.50 but the meat was tougher than Mahathir and Lee Chong Wei combined, the soup lacked fragrance, the canned mushrooms were out of place and even the dark soya sauce with chilli was tasteless. The prawn crackers and prawn noodles were ok but far from great. The sugar cane was diluted. Seats were limited. Only cash was accepted. Also, the kitchen staff felt like they hated their jobs."

Updated on 6 Nov 2021: wasn't happy with the food here since last few visit. The food wasn't as tasty as it used to be, especially claypot chicken rice. And yesterday was our time tried their wan ton noodles (towards more sweetness) and fried carrot cake (towards more salty), to be more exact in Chinese.. 两盘没有灵魂的食物。😅 The dishes only ""looked"" authentic but the taste is below expectation. Same goes to kopi c ice. :(  was rated 5 stars in year 2019, but the food standards wasn't maintain since my past few visits."

Quality varies by stalls but some dishes like the Penang Char Kway Teow are quite close to the original’s. Portion sizes can be a little small for the price but still worth a visit if you’re craving for Malaysian food. Food court can be crowded and some dishes like the Hokkien Noodles can take a long time to prepare. Some patience required."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNDlyOVZREAE,Malaysia Boleh,3,"Not sure why the Malaysia Boleh Fried Oyster no longer has the special Penang Fried Oyster taste. It's still good, but it taste like our regular local Fried Oyster. I miss their Penang flavored! Chendol still as good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNm8ySFZBEAE,Malaysia Boleh,1,"This is a disgrace to Malaysia street food.
Especially the service standard.
And the ""no say"" attitude in your preference of chilli or not. Because there is only 1 type set by the stall, simply this is their way which you have to accept.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X3BtMkxREAE,Malaysia Boleh,1,"The new cai png stall is for risk takers. Ordering cai png here is like navigating a field of land mines. The promo during the first few days of opening will lead you to think that prices are cheap with no surprises, but things then changed. Meat that look like they’re cooked in a similar way can cost very different. A bit of canned mushrooms lingering in veggie dishes will make them cost the same as meat dishes. They don’t inform you when you order the dish. Simply misleading."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dmRIRVl3EAE,Malaysia Boleh,3,"Food is tasty and price is fair. Please improve the ventilation so that patrons do not leave the place with smelly clothes, the smell is noticeable after entering to Dabao."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNjdmZGh3RRAB,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Awesome Malaysia foods.  Reasonably priced and the standards of most stalls are consistent in all the Malaysia Boleh foodcourts in Singapore. The dried chilli ban main is definitely worth mentioning. The handmade noodles are chewy and very Q. Not the soggy sort. The sauce and chilli combo is just right. The addition of soft boiled egg further enhances the smoothness of the noodles. The ikan bilis are fried to perfection. Crispy and not salty at all. As usual, the foodcourt is packed with patrons from 3-5pm (weekdays) during their coffee and tea promo. Only 50 cents a cup! Highly recommend if your are craving for some authentic good old Malaysian dishes."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaVBqb3hRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,5,"Always crowded on peak meal hours - try going on off peak hours. I tried a few dishes (prawn mee, wanton mee, roast duck, and the chendol) and it was - I think - the closest you can get to the original. Prices are affordable (not Malaysia affordable; Singapore affordable!). Dishes are quite reasonably portioned (I get full after one dish). The chendol I thought was the best of all the rest of the food, and is the first stall I would drop by.
Completely recommend, and sometimes I have cravings thinking about it!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1akw3WDdRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,2,Ordered the dry banmian ($4.50) and requested more chillies. It turned out salty but not spicy at all. The popiah ($2.50) so so only and cendol ($2.50) was tasteless and diluted.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMkpMMWtRRRAB,Malaysia Boleh,4,"Ordered Claypot chicken rice via a delivery app.

Rice was fragrant with sesame oil. Taste-wise it was good. Salty and slight sweetness from the black sauce. Their chili is really spicy and slightly sour. I usually just mix it in together with the rice which adds an extra kick to the dish. For the ingredients, there were quite a few chunks of chicken but I didn't like that the skin was on as the skin was very chewy. There were also two small pieces of salted fish and only ONE miserable slice of my favourite Chinese sausage. *Sobs*
Well actually I have ordered this a few times and the amount of ingredients given are usually inconsistent.

Overall I do like their claypot chicken rice but I wished they were more consistent with the amount of ingredients in each order."

The food we ate, everything, from clay pot chicken rice, carrot cake, oyster egg, chendol to appam was awesome. We loved it and the food is very reasonably priced.
Malaysia boleh is similar to a medium sized food court, which offers its customers a plethora of food options (Malaysian food) via various shops/vendors under one umbrella. It is self service, and we get to see our food getting prepped before us.

The best parts:
1. Good quality food
2. Helpful staff who guides it's customers to get seats (this is a life saver :)...when hungry)
3. Though we have long queues, we get our food ready in a timely manner
4. Surprisingly, thr was less oil in everything
5. Absolute value for money

For all the above reasons, we are gonna come here again!!!  :) and recommend to others as well."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNk9fVkdREAE,Malaysia Boleh,4,Malaysia street foods and it's delicious. I'll say quite close to the taste I ate in Malaysia. Maybe the dining environment is different so you don't really feel the same. Price is similar to other food courts. At least it is a change from the usual food choices we have in other food courts.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXN1bUdREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"$1 per stick only. Price is good.
But taste is too salty especially the black sauce part, perhaps it tasted better without black sauce.
Enoki roll after fried seem to overcooked until the enoki mushroom become very small but taste good 👍 just too small.
Overall taste is good except the salty black sauce which I think they did not spread the sauce evenly.
They also provide many different dips to eat with the skews."

Cooking of the food was really quick and the skewers below totaled up to $12.

They only serve processed meat but DLLM has meat on sticks and satay sticks. The rest of the ingredients are pretty much the same. Taste wise,  the seasoning is not as flavorful as DLLM. But,  their homemade chilli sauce is really good.
Overall,  it was ok but I'd still prefer DLLM as they have real meat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1BUY1hBEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,Deep fry is the only choice. Relatively small selection. Pricing to portion ratio can be high. Coffee shop can get pretty crowded in the evening. Parking may be a challenge.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbjhfRGhRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"Carried only a small selection of lok lok items, which are all simply deep fried. Then either sprinkled with a salt pepper mix or brushed over with a soya sauce based marinate. Everything starts to taste the same by your third skewer. Special chilli sauce packs quite a punch.

Ordinary. Even though at $1."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX0w2N1p3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"Have been patronising Loklok 1991 for quite sometime and I must say that their Loklok standard is one of the more consistent ones out there. This stall is mend by young hawkers and have been around the area for a few years now. The coffeeshop has a few other stall that sells very nice food such as curry chicken and Thai food, including mookata as well as western cuisine.

Back to the Loklok review. Comparing it to the ones that I have tried before elsewhere, it is one of my favourite. From the sauce that they use, the chilli options that they have and the freshness of the food, it has been great so far. Their choices of Loklok is also quite wide but so come early or you might not be able to get some of the favourite options such as mushrooms, brocoli and etc.

Keep up the consistency and I will visit everytime I want to bring my friends over for supper!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOTQyMWlBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"my favourite lok lok stall in sg! im not sure if they bbq or deep fry, but it has more of a bbq grilled yummy taste and not oily. im guessing this could be a rare stall that do bbq over deepfry (most other loklok stalls deepfry)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa3Z6NkFREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,Broccoli flavour is so yummy!! But wish their BBQ flavouring could be more standardised. Sometimes its nice sometimes it's not after such a long wait
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaGZLOC1BRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,1,"I have just ordered this from grab delivery... Very disappointed with the food/per stick portion. And my food is mostly burned and bitter... I think most reviews here is either fake OR my order is done very badly.

I personally will not eat from their store in the future.

---------------------------
Responding to the owner's respond... Already said the order is burned and bitter...

Not sure, which part of my statements wasn't clear to you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLLTQtQ0FREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"A good place to chill, $1 loklok per stick. They provide 3 types of sauce: Satay, Sweet Chili, and their signature chili sauce. However the place is crowded during dinner, might take time to get your seat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcG9HUllREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"A bit overrated and dry on few of the items, this Lok Lok seems to be deep fried only. Love the fried beancurd skin, mantou and the satay sauce.
There are also other choices like enoki mushroom with bacon, aubergine, cheese ball, broccoli, luncheon meat, quail eggs. Some of the food are really a bit dry and the foodcourt runs out of seats easily to mookata and the wait is long. I would come early if I’m coming second time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X3NXZWlnRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,Great sauce that adds bountiful flavor to the loklok. 1 dollar per stick. Variety is okay but can be better. Quite fast service and cooking. Good value and generally this coffee shop is hipster with good variety of other food to go with. Recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNmRYYUtREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"Not a great value preposition at $1 per stick of very cheap ingredient. But you can't beat the good variety of fried veggies, meat and seafood to accompany your mookata (23 in all). Although there is a minor queue when I turned up, the food is served fast (within 10 mins). You can choose from a selection of 4 sauces (satay, sweet thai chili,  sweet sauce and  homemade made Chilli). The place was rocking when I turned up (around 7.45pm) on Friday. The place attracts the young crowd and I recommend the outer sitting areas ( which is cooler). The place can get quite warm because of the many platters of mookata sizzling. I have chosen the mushroom set paired with a few odds and ends. The tare sauce with a dusting of white pepper on it enhances the nuances of fried unami. One thing can be improved is the rate of replenishment of the popular ingredients, the ingredients can be standby in the larger chiller in the back and quickly replenished in small batches as the night goes on. I happen to missed out on the eggplant 🍆 and fried fish because of that. But overall a good spot if you are looking for a platter of fried stuff and to nibble in a patpong soi vibe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTMEt6WTN3RRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"Lok Lok served here are $1 per stick so if the item has 2 sticks, it's $2.
I would say the food was so-so, not crispy as expected and not really to my liking. All of the Lok Lok are drizzled with a black pepper sauce(?) which wasn't to my liking. Maybe would have like it more without the sauce. They also have sauces which you can grab yourself, satay, chili and sweet chili."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LS1XWDdBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"Just putting an honest review here.
Decent food (abit salty for me) decent price.
But i wouldn’t go back again because we queued for 1hr plus and waited 40mins for the food.

The stall owner is friendly and nice but really need to work something out to speed up the orders if you don’t want to lose customers."
ChJDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5S0EQAQ,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Great taste, good selection of ingredients, value for money at  $1 /stick including premium ingredients like scallop. excellent service and located in nice hip coffee shop."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MUxuVzZRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"At $1/stick, nice loklok (and sauces) made from fresh ingredients, together with good service, we'll definitely be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbzdYSW53RRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"One of the best lok lok I ever have, the original sauce that came with it is already very nice as it is, and they still provide option for extra sauces!

Appreciate Daniel and Meng for going extra mile, making the delivery this evening when there's no grab driver. Thank you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbHBILWxRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"1 stick for $1 lok lok! 😋 The brocolli are a must-order!! The seasoning used is different from the other places I've tried as well, tasted more peppery than usual."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbC15cU9REAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Deep fried to perfection. Mantou and taukee is a must!
Sauces are average, but the chilli is worth a dip."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycWNfVlJBEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Fun food for a late night snack with friends, I recommend the broccoli, seaweed chicken and breaded scallops. Service comes with a smile too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NjREcHJ3RRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,food was good，fast and cheap
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbFlmeFlnEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,Very popular. Can wait 30min on weekend evening.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcUxXTXZRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,By far the best Lok Lok I have eaten in Singapore. Far better than the famous that the DLLM LOK LOK that need to queue for 2 hours.. 100% worth it
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc3JuQkxnEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,Have a sweet glaze(I'm guessing it's honey) on the Lok Lok. Just taste weird. Personally not for me.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpLUtMdkVREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"not bad, affordable pricing. their homemade sauce is nice and goes well with the food. will come back again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MVp6X3JnRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Great spot to satisfy your craving for JB lok lok! Authentic and nice! Personal favourites are the oyster mushroom, broccoli and fish fillet!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX1BLSGhBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"Just fried food, nothing special. Home made chilli sauce is nice though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeTZqdUV3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,Alot of sauce to choose from and really reasonably priced. Opens till late too! Perfect for supper :)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNS15R1pREAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,2,"Food was not hot, just little warm.
Salty and small serving.
Chilli not fantastic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzVHQmR3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Tried several lok lok, still prefers this over the others. Great food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjbElQNTBnRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Wide variety of sticks to choose from, at affordable prices and four types of sauces to dip into. Happiness!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OU11M0h3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,3,"Food was so so only. Not sure why so many rave reviews. Very limited selection, no fresh meat, and quantity is small so you dont get much for $1. Broccoli was soooooo thin. Too much pepper. But overall average for lok lok"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4X1A2ZExnEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Very tasty, food well presented. Price wise very economical! Thumbs up for the service! ❤️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ2ItdXRBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"yay to good AND affordable loklok! went tonight and whilst the queue was long, food took really quick to come. the staff there were great and polite! the broccoli tasted amazing!! :D must try their mantou as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2NmRfOE5REAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"$1 lok loks are really affordable, flavour is pretty accurate and authentic. Overall solid. But I just wish there were more options like meat skewers and etc. Maybe do a premium $2 per stick series or something. Other than that overall its still a decent hang to get your Lok Lok fix."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNFBpZlpBEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"Pretty decent Lok Lok, priced at $1 per stick with a variety of sauces (which you can choose 2). I particularly liked that they offer mantou cos who doesn't like a good fried bun right?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNl9xRThBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"There are plenty of creative varieties when picking the menu, and the sauces are delicious. I really love their food especially the broccoli and bacon wrap enoki. Pleasant, fuss free and fast experience over the delivery process. Greatly recommend!☺️"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzOHZDeWlBRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,Value for money $1 per stick but must wait a bit for the food to serve
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpd1ByU3hRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"For 1 dollar a stick.
It's pretty decent. Would love if they added more seasoning. Can't really compare to Johor standard but it's good enuf if you have a craving.
Theres Thai milk tea from the drink stall and mookata near by too. Overall a good place to chill and eat"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN1pDb3J3RRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Good place to hangout with friends and family, variety choices of food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTLVpUclpBEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"My to go loklok place in sg ever since, we can’t go into Jb. I really like the chilli sauce, not sure why some ppl in the comments will say the chilli sauce is not spicy enough etc etc, personally I love it. If not spicy enough, bring your own chilli.

Do try out the fried mushrooms, it retains the crunch really well, I really like the Enoki wrapped with bacon. And yes, the fried Zai Er. Must wait for it to cool down, and after that the crunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2djlXWGJ3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Food is great and affordable at $1/stick.
Staff are friendly and service is fast!

Revisited this place a couple of times and will recommend to my friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLN29ERTRRRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"After visiting a few loklok stalls, I still come back to this stall! This is really the best LOKLOK stall for me. The food was fried at the right temperature and duration! After a long day, this is my comfort food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOS1hd25nRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,2,Surprise the variety not that many...lok lok served is too dried after fried...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2Rub0Z3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,Valued for money and their sauce for their Lok Lok are great!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbnVqQ0dnEAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"Decent Lok Lok, seasoning and chili is on point, and all the people tending the stall are friendly and polite. Sticks get refreshed often enough despite the demand. For those giving a low score based on the price and the queue and lack of seats, omg what is wrong with you people... this is 1) Singapore, and $1 a stick is reasonable; 2) this is a kopitiam for crying out loud!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcG9tRG9BRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,1,"Salty and cold. Not worth the 2 hour waiting time.
1 hr queue and 1 hr to wait for food to cook.

Once the buzzer ringed, we straight took our food. So i not sure how did that 10 second walk from their shop to our table (since it was just beside them) cooled our food immediately."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4NWVXQTNnRRAB,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,4,"Food is less oily and salty than others, while the sauces are just decent. 1hr queue to select the sticks you want; another 1 hr wait for the sticks to be cooked. Be prepared to wait!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhaUp2blB3EAE,Loklok 1991’s by Daniel & Meng,5,"By far the best lok lok in Singapore I have tried! Their lok lok have the perfect sauce & seasoning and especially their home-made chili sauce, it was the bomb. Must try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMlBLUmhRRRAB,Selera Istimewa,4,"Chance upon this stall selling Nasi Padang on the last row at the cheng san market and food centre. I was there around 1pm and the selection of dishes to select from was still huge. There was a short queue when i was there.

Selected 3 dishes, sambal hotdogs, egg and cabbage, paid SGD$4 for my meal. Food was pretty decent. Love the lemak chilli padi gravy, very rich and the spiciness level was alright. Portion wise, just right for me and quite value for money.

Their other dishes looks quite mouthwatering as well. I would try their other dishes next time round."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eXBQSlVREAE,Selera Istimewa,2,"Over rated in my opinion. Overall taste quite blend and not very tasty.
Came all the way from bedok but was disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcl9xM1RREAE,Selera Istimewa,4,"Awesome old school Nasi Lemak. Eggs are nicely browned and the rice still smells of coconut, not always the case these days. Sambal was lovely too! Begedil was not to my liking though. Chicken wings were pretty good, with juicy flesh!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdzQtZVBBEAE,Selera Istimewa,5,"Nasi lemak, $3, comes with fried chicken wing, egg and ikan bilis. Chili is spicy and rice is rich in coconut milk aroma."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMS12M1lnEAE,Selera Istimewa,4,Food is good. portion is very generous. Served by friendly makciks would recommend others to come here to try their nasi lemak and nasi sambal goreng
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NFludXFnRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,4,"The Signature Royal is sold out so I opt for Fried Chicken and Fish. Chicken is tender and juicy , rice is fragrance and chilli is the main draw."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NU5qQ013EAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,"Ordered the Royal Rumble set which include a piece of everything.
The highlight is the chilli, not too sweet and not too overpowering, it is just nice for my liking .

Highly recommended if you are craving for a fantastic nasi lemak!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyck9TWkJREAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,4,"Went for Royal Rumble, $6.50.  Comes with Dish, chicken wing, begedil, otah. They used basmati rice, slight fragrance. Sambal a little spicy, good. Begedil also good. Fish ok. Chicken wing a bit crispy, not flavourful enough. Egg is runny which is usually overcook. Otah tasted soso. Overall very decent plate of nasi lemak."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleTlQTVJBEAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,"Their Nasi lemak never disappoints. Always seen with long queues, that’s how you’ll know it’s good!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdWZfZzFRRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,"Nasi Lemak. A ubiquitous dish easily found all around our island! Easy to find, but to get something really good, not all that easy!
Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak. It's hands-down our family's favourite coconut-infused meal. No attention is sacrificed to detail. The rice; bryani, cooked with coconut milk. This gives the Nasi that beady-rice appearance which doesn't clump together when served. Bryani itself already has an aromatic smell on its own, so infused with coconut milk, brings the flavour and aroma to a whole new level altogether!

Those wings! Amazingly crispy! We love just how our meal is accompanied by the 'music' of crackly sounds whenever somebody bites into their chicken wing! The seasoning permeates into the meat, moist and steamy-soft layers that follow the crispy outsides!

And what is Nasi Lemak without its sambal? The sambal used here is sweet and tangy, with hints of onion-sweetness, and paired with their already flavourful rice, makes for a meal befitting a Tuan:)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXc19LWndnRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,2,Please update the store's operating hrs diligently as there were few occasions that we came all the way frm Tpayoh unfortunately the shop was found closed. Thk u

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLU83Tll3EAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,As good as their main stall in Adam Road. No queue.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdWIzdXZBRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,4,"The sambal was excellent, ingredients were fresh but the price was a bit steep considering it's located in HDB kopitiam. Take note they suka suka open, suka suka close."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeEpfTHFnRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,4,"There were only three people ahead of me but the queue moved very slowly. Out of 7 choices displayed, only 3 or4 were available. Food quality seemed to have dropped. Only the rice and chilly still taste good. Ikan bilis are very small and the fried chicken was tasteless although it still kept its crispiness. Overall, this is still an above average nasi lemak meal. Thanks to the fantastic chilly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydHNpeXpnRRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,The best nasi lemak.....no issue parking also.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNXZYdEdnEAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,"Quiet place to have a good meal.

NOT the first time either, even when the stated day of rest is every friday."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeWRmVkVREAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,4,"Fluffy and fragrant rice. Ikan bilis and chicken wings are crispy and tasty. The best is still the chilli sambal, which makes the nasi lemak complete. Too bad the whole lot of otah were snapped up through a pre-order and didn't get to taste the complete royal rumble. Next time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaFlMY3l3RRAB,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,3,The begedil and chilli was good. The rice was a bit hard for my liking and the chicken could have been seasoned longer.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTX3BqV0dREAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,3,"This is the same stall located at Adam Road, the famous Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak. They used long-grain basmati rice cooked with coconut milk and pandan leaves. It is rich and fragrant until you can smell the delicate aroma from the rice. It paired well with their own-made sweet spicy sambal chili. I ordered the $5 set and it comes with otah, fried chicken wings, ikan bilis, egg and cucumber slices. They were all pretty normal, nothing really special and on a downside, they were all served cold.

Overall, the rice was really delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but for the side dishes, I just felt they weren’t all that good to me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDU3b05BEAE,Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak,5,Come and try.. 👍

If you like to have your meal with cold air conditioning, and variety of Malay traditional foods, this place suits you.

I never order their other foods except their Malay Nasi Padang. Quite variety of choices, I especially liked their Chicken Merah (red means). With pick another 2 vegetable for a meal, it cost $5.80. Portion are quite big. Could easily feed 2 small eaters.

Foods cost are rising tremendously, I used to buy it at $5 for 1 meat 2 veggies. Reasonable enough they increased 80¢ more, as long as they keep their standard well. Hope they not increasing again.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdU9qWHdnRRAB,"Asam Tree Cafe, Bakery & Restaurant",1,I ordered the food (nasi lemak) through foodpanda today but the rice turned out to be uncooked it was raw. The chicken tasted as though it was recycled.

Standard of food is about same as those sold in mrt stations. But at a different price point.

2 stars for the black pepper chicken rice. The soup was as salty as sea water. The quarter chicken was refried to a shade darker than fast food chicken, and then tossed with the black pepper sauce.

3 stars as the ice coffee saved the meal."

So i ask this chinese lady which i guess is the ""manager"" cause her colleagues called her, so i asked that if i could have a bag of soup for my chicken rice. She firmly just said ""oh no soup no soup"" when i literally saw there is a pot of soup behind them. After i walk off, heard the colleagues together with the manager laugh off at me thinking i didn't hear them. Super disappointed!! Is this how you treat your customer?! RIDICULOUS!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZbE1tMzdnRRAB,"Asam Tree Cafe, Bakery & Restaurant",1,"So pricey but the food tastes horrible! Sambal sotong was so runny and bland, tasted like squids plainly cooked in chilli and water. When you look into the display, they play with colours to excite, but they know nuts about Malay cooking. If you want better Malay food, I think the one at AMK Hub's Foodfare is a better run for your money. Not the best, but at least good tasting."

the chicken they give me is totally unacceptable

i hope the stall owner kindly look into it as it will affect your business if give this kind of crispy chicken to your customer
Very Disappointed"

Ordered power ($4.8) and extra ($6.3). Extra come with drumstick which I find it bland and not really tender.
But the gravy when mixed with satay sauce goes well the noodles."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbjZIcUNnEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,3,Saw lots of reviews and was excited about this being my 1st mee rebus experience. And maybe I just don't like mee rebus but not what I was expecting. The sauce was good and chicken was good. Satay sauce was great unfortunately they didn't start selling satay yet. Maybe I don't know but it seems like this gravy would be better on maybe something besides noodles? Not sure but didn't seem to go well together.  Flavorful but disappointing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN1BhRXBnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Ok the photo may look a bit messy but this mee rebus is good stuff. Noodles portion is larger than average, n the $5 'Power' version also gets u a decent chunk of chicken. Gravy remains nice n thick to the very last strand of noodle"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMlpfX0lREAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Rich, sweet and creamy mee rebus. Easily one of the best in Singapore. Ayam is soft and tender, and the satay peanut sauce gives it such a delightful experience overall. It’s a very rich and filling meal overall, so prepare your stomach."

The chicken satay is also really good. They only use chicken thigh meat. Every bite of the chicken satay is tender and juicy. If you like satay kajang in Malaysia, you will definitely like this one too. Going to try their mutton satay on my next visit because they don't have it today. - Satay only available after 3pm."

After a few spoon full I get jelak. I don't think will order t soto again, will only go there for their m.rebus power or maybe try their satay.
Ps. Rahim gives more chix as compare to t other famous m.rebus with chix n satay  sauce @ AMK ctrl hawker stall"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ai1HRUJREAE,Rahim Muslim Food,1,"Was excited to try their mee rebus after watching Chef Bob’s review but was unpleasantly surprised by the uncle’s rudeness. We came at 1130am and asked if there is still mee rebus, we didn’t know that they only open at 1230noon. To our dismay, he answered us rudely by saying “can’t you see we are preparing?” We don’t stay around there, so we don’t know the area well. We don’t need 5 star treatment, just be polite. Even though we never had the chance to try the food, I will never come back. I don’t owe you a living to be treated that way."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5b1lPVjlnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,4,It's my go to place for mee soto. $4.50 serving gives a lot of chicken and one piece of begedil . Soup is favorful. Tonight I am lucky there is still chicken satay available. It's huge ... $0.70 each. Peanut sauce is not as chunky as other stalls.perhaps is end if day already.. Sad that mutton is sold out.  Normally the stalk close or sold out by 7pm.

A good authentic taste of mee rebus topped with a satay peanut sauce and if you prefer it with chicken and extra $1. Overall, a good plate of mee rebus but nothing special about other than the addition of satay peanut sauce. Service was fast and sometimes a short queue will be require during peak period.
P.S since its in Broadway kopitiam chain, expect the drinks to be super overpriced.

Also, expect long queues!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbk03elpREAE,Rahim Muslim Food,4,"Malay braised noodles, or Mee Rebus is a comfort food since childhood growing up in Singapore's multicultural heartland. And tucked in the heartland of Singapore is this Muslim food stall of more than 4 decade's history moving from location to location over the years. On offering is a few basic dishes only, Satay from 230pm, Mee Soto and of course Mee Rebus their specialty. Menu starts from $3.50, $4.50 Power Mee Rebus or $6 Extra Special. In general, Mee Rebus is a yellow noodle dish, and most places offer them with bean sprouts, fried taukua, green chillies and hard boiled egg, topped with fried shallots. The star is always the thick, taucheo sweet potatoes sauce with rich umami. Different stalls uses different braising base from mutton, beef, chicken, dried shrimps, ikan bilis to even swimming crab as soup base of the sauce. Some has strong taucheo taste, some rich while some watery, and mostly too sweet. Hence at Rahim's their rich and thick sauce has the right consistency, not too starchy and not too sweet. Enough savoury umami to coat the sauce, ans unique to this stall, top with a coat of peanut satay sauce. And on the side, if you like it spicy, black chilli and ketchup manis to add depths to the flavour. Enough sauce to coat the chewy noodles nicely, and add a whole lime to give the broth a tangy twist. The Power version gets you tumeric flavoured boiled chicken slices, and the extra special gets you a whole chicken leg. The chicken is nicely marinated, juicy and simmered to the right texture. Enough to bite chunks off the chicken meat, flavourful and tender. Bean sprouts and vegs provide crunch to the dish, and my only gripe is missing fried shallots or would have made this 5/5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRb2ZicVBBEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Mee rebus with chicken is delicious! The chicken is not shredded chicken, but bigger pieces. 1 whole hard boiled egg. What makes it special is the satay sauce drizzled on top. Taste wise,  this mee rebus is sweet. The soto ayam is good too.

Standard is still good after 1 year. But price has increased. Mee rebus with chicken is now $4.50."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVd2FfdkFnEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,3,"The only problem I had with the stall was I was way too unlucky. For a long time, I wanted to try this stall but the first 2 times I went(on different dates), I was greeted by a closed stall and a notice that says they will be closed for several days due to some reasons and that we had to check their FB as to when they will open again. So this time I checked... nothing means open and so....

This is my third visit to this stall and I finally got to try their extra power mee Soto and mee rebus for take away.  It was good that the gravy and soup were packed separately from the noodles so that even upon reaching home, the noodles weren’t soggy.  Both came with a large chicken thigh which is nice and tender.

Personally I find the portion too big for me, I should order the normal version next time without the chicken.  Otherwise taste is ok, nothing out of the ordinary."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdjlDYUtBEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"From the very best SOTO Ayam stall in the world ! Well known too for hai Mee rebus power and Satay, this stall has been my TOP fav since school days . Do support them !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpak5lWXRnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"I've been eating from Rahim from 1987 that is 33 years.

I've tried many so called
"" esoteric""  sotos and after now I reckon this is the best.

This Soto is more inclined to the Indonesian style.

Some of the prominent differences are :

1. The materials  especially the chicken is very fresh.

2. The blend of spices in the soup is perfect.

3. The portions of chicken is generous and not OVERLY Cooked. So it's very SOFT, TENDER & SUCCULENT .

So the combination is thus  perfect and they have also  successfully RETAINED a home cooked touch.

In the past I've a Malay friend from Kuala Lumpur who came and packed 30 + packets and brought it back by plane ( what an effort)

So its has to be good.

If you've been following my reviews you'll know that my comments are very Conservative and alway ""under promised"" & over performed, always way above what I shared and you'll not be disappointed.

Do go and try once and you'll be longing for the taste of this unique Soto."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dG9QWWtnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,4,Bee Hoon Soto Extra Special. Extra special basically gives you a chicken drumstick instead of shredded chicken.  I have always lamented that bee hoon soto lack the meat but the option of getting a drumstick now from this stall... #shutupandtakemymoney.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcjRUZGp3RRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,4,1 norm mee robus - nice savoury sauce and mee soto special with huge drumstick and bagedel... soto sauce is not my favour but its norm. Chilli is power. Worth the trip
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhM3YzcFJnEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"If you want to enjoy authentic and juicy satay, you NEED to get from Rahim Muslim Food!

Each satay is packed with thick cut of chicken meat, it is VERY WELL SEASONED, extremely JUICY and not to mention TENDER!

The satay sauce is more on the watery consistency, and peanut taste is not as strong as it should be. However, it does goes really well with the satay.

On top of that each chicken satay cost 70cent, and its really worth the bucks for the quality it serves.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNmVLdVpBEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,4,"Mee Rebus with a twist, definitely worthwhile to add the poached chicken for just additional one dollar. Though the mee rebus is good in itself, the gravy is a tad overly gooey so the added chicken really help balance out the texture of the whole dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkttQll3EAE,Rahim Muslim Food,4,"The stall uncle and aunties are all soft spoken with a friendly smile. The mee rebus was tasty and spicy with a tinge of sweetness. They lay on 2 type of sauce on the mee rebus which I think made it very tasty. The pricing was cheap too. My ""extra special"" plate cost $5plus only. It comes with a chicken thigh meat which taste soft and juicy. Best taste mee rebus in my personal opinion."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa19xdXhRRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,3,"For those who love to eat very sweet mee rebus, then this is the one.  The satay sauce topping was even sweeter than the rebus gravy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcnF1LThRRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,One of the best Mee Rebus in town! Generous portion and value for money! They add Satay Sauce on top which really complements the Mee Rebus very well!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnX0tUcFd3EAE,Rahim Muslim Food,4,"The taste is unlike the usual Mee rebus you find elsewhere. The gravy is sweet and if you get the Mee Rebus extra special, they'll add a huge chicken drumstick with satay gravy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbHJxdGhBRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,Their Power Mee Rebus is the King of Mee Rebus for me. Tangy gravy doused with peanut sauce and tongue-tingling green chillies (scoop aside if you can't take the heat) topped with a generous portion of kampung chicken. You will leave with a bulging belly and wide smile on your face. The portion is hearty even though it's just $4.50 (think it's $5 or $5.50 now as of July 2022). A must-try for at least once in your life
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaWVXdXJnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"After reading about Rahim's mee rebus, we made a trip there for lunch. We arrived just as the stall was about to open at 12pm. Already, the customers were queuing as they sat around the few tables in front of the stall. Somehow, each knew their place in the queue. Once the stall was ready, the customers formed into a queue.

The mee rebus was good and the portion was generous. A serving of satay peanut sauce was placed over the chicken and mee rebus. Sauce was thick enough to coat the yellow noodles. The sauce wasn't overly sweet, unlike most other mee rebus. Nice and hearty meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdzRLWnh3RRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Food is a total no complaint, absolutely superb. Worth of every single penny spend. Whole chicken drumstick is crazy. Chicken meat must go with their homemade dark soy sauce chilli."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXakxIRF9RRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,3,Tried to purchase some food from them but I assumed I went a bit late at about 4.45pm and their other items were sold out except a little balance for Satay. Maybe would try some other time. But I noticed that their not too customer's friendly or maybe they're worn out for the day!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjOGFYSGlnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"The last time I ate their Mee Rebus “Power” was when they were at upper Serangoon. During that time I was already impressed with their  generous portion and price at $4.50.

Now after more then 10 years, (Thanks to CNA for featuring them) managed to find them once again and tried the  “Power” Mee Rebus again.
This time round I am Super impressed!!!!
It is still $4.50, taste and the portion remains the same  Which is generous!!!! How can this be possible as everything in Singapore have already spiral up.

Maybe it’s due to CNA featuring them the Q happened to be pretty long,
Plus they need to chop the chicken up therefore it took a while."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMmRpdnpnRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,So tasty and delicious. I am no expert on the dish mee rebus but here it tastes superb. I have also sampled their mutton satay which is very nice as well. The prices are extremely low.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGRTbmd3RRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,Good taste startedong time ago at opp Malay mosque now near Amk Interchange
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aFpETlBBEAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,The mee rebus is outstanding. Love the mee Soto too

Must try!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDgyUDRRRRAB,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Mee Rebus was very tasty. Chicken Satay was generous, succulent and satisfying. On top of that, prices were very affordable. Thumbs Up!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLazVLQVd3EAE,Rahim Muslim Food,5,"Mee Rebus was the best I have eaten for a long long time. Definitely worth the money paid and effort going there.
Returned to stall this evening at 6.35 pm since it is listed as closed at 7 pm.
Unfortunately the stall was already washing up.
Next trip will have my family go along to try the Mee Soto (reported to be just as good) as well."

There was a lot of stuff on the menu that my friends and I couldn’t understand and not wanting to hog the queue, we randomly decided to order them. Uncle was very friendly and took time to ask if we knew what the bowl consisted of and explained to us 💯 Lovely service!

Ordered the Mee rebus with drumstick, bagedel and chicken satay. Portion was very generous and Mee rebus gravy was really thick flavourful (might be jelak to some), but not something I would travel all out for unless I’m in the vicinity. Chicken satay and bagedel were really nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLXZiMHZnRRAB,Yunos N Family,4,"Their Mee Rebus is one of their signature dish you must absolutely try. The noodles were coated with thick aromatic potato gravy, which was so good that would leave you craving for another bowl. Definitely worth to queue and try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUtEb1JBEAE,Yunos N Family,5,"Best satay ever. No short cut with fats trimming between meat like those in other satay places.

New Rebus and Soto, still the best.. Wow so yummy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3ZMTllnEAE,Yunos N Family,3,"15/04/22
Mee rebus over rated. There are better ones. The satay is ok but still lack of flavour. However, the meat portion is generous unlike other satay sellers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ak1QSlZREAE,Yunos N Family,2,"Food not as good as what it used to be.

Soto is diluted and the soup is cloudy unlike authentic clear soup.

Mee rebus is super thick and just does not taste like the authentic Malay mee rebus.

Mutton Satay is tender and peanut gravy is good. At last.. we can enjoy the satay.

The use of paper bowl and diaposable fork and spoon is a good improvement to avoid cross contamination of food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtemJMWVJBEAE,Yunos N Family,4,"Finally tried this famous stall as the queue was short today. Had the basic mee rubus and had it packed home. The uncle was nice in asking whether I wanted my noodles and sauce packed separately, which was much appreciated as my journey home was quite long.

I finally ate it some 45 minutes later, so the noodles were understandably slightly soggy. Quite a lot of noodles and the gravy was smooth, though not much tau kwa pieces or bean sprout to help cut through the cloyness of just eating noodles.

Perhaps next time I should try having it there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MjlLekpREAE,Yunos N Family,5,"finally this Hawker is back in business after renovation.

clean facilities, easy dine disposable utensils

what I enjoy the most is mee rebus with chicken, soto and mutton satay

for newbies, I would recommend mee rebus with chicken as I'm a chicken lover.

soto recommended for those who like soupy stuff

satay is a charcoal grilled meat [mutton, beef, chicken or tripe]
it is tasty when served with peanut sauce....yum² 😋"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHZmVE5nEAE,Yunos N Family,4,"Mee Rebus was sold out at 6:45pm!
We settled for the chicken satay and beehoon Soto drumstick.

The satay was awesome, tender and juicy.  The satay sauce enhanced the taste further.  It was rich and full of peanut crunch.

The beehoon soto was better than expected.

We would definitely go back to try the popular mee rebus."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzRLVFN3EAE,Yunos N Family,5,Always loving it! First time I had the satay! The chicken is so tender and soft!!

Tip: add that one begedel with the mee soto please.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNmJHUk1BEAE,Yunos N Family,5,Mee Soto and Mee Rebus are always good. Long queue but just be patient and you'll get to order eventually. satay is also very good! Bang for your buck!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcUlfWDNRRRAB,Yunos N Family,4,"To be honest, the soup base is on the sweet side, even with the side of chilli, it was more to the sweet rather than spicy. I prefer savory taste so might not try again but other than that, the food is fresh. I would recommend their satay instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTei1DaTFRRRAB,Yunos N Family,5,"Introduced to this gem Muslim hawker, find their mee Soto, mee rebus and satays very delicious, affordable and satisfying. Hawker very friendly.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxXy1xM1BnEAE,Yunos N Family,4,Bee Hoon Soto Drumstick. Probably Ang Mo Kio's central most famous Mee Soto stall and I only recently realise they actually have a drumstick version for the anti shredded chicken person like me!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdThEeVpBEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"We arrived at 11am and there was surprisingly no queue. But once we bought our food, a queue formed.

We ordered the small bowl ($4.50) and opted for Ipoh hor fun. Sadly, there was no more fish cake, so we only had the handmade fishball and tau pok.

At first I had commented to my friend that the noodles seemed like a lot. But in the end, I finished them in no time and was scrapping the bottom of my bowl. 🤪

The hor fun was flavourful as it soaked up the sauce. My friend thought it wasn’t salty enough but it was just nice for my palate. Plus the bits of pork lard gave it an extra kick.

I read a blogger’s review that the fishball isn’t as bouncy as others as it is handmade from only yellowtail fish meat and no fillers are added. But I thought it was very bouncy. Not a big fan of the tau pok but I don’t mind it.

Overall, not bad and will return if I’m in the vicinity. And I like that the cook and the auntie cashier are friendly. (I dislike hawkers who scold or are rude to their customers and will not patronise them regardless of how nice their food may be.)"

When it was my turn after 35 mins wait, there were 2 fishballs each in our soup. When we tasted them, it was heaven. I had never ate such a fantastic taste of handmade fishballs. It pays off for our patience. We will definitely go back for his fishballs. Fish cakes were just as good. Noodles were just as great and tasty as well. Ample parking spaces for those who drive."

The above is the testimonial to how awestruck I am with the fishball and the taupok with fish paste.

Fishball has a slight chew to it. It's like eating a real tender rare wagyu beef but it's fishball!

The taupok with fishpaste was the highlight for me. Soaked with the savoury soup, a bite of it is simply a piece of heaven for me.

The noodle wasn't in the best shape as it was bought home instead of eating it at the coffeeshop.

Highly recommend it but do expect to wait a while.

Queued for 15-20 min, the queue may seem long but the uncle was real quick so it moved fast!"

No doubt the fish balls and fish cakes are nice with their dry noodles filled with pork lard and shallot oil. Small portion of noodles with fish ball, fish cake and tofu are filling. I personally like their porcelain bowl and soup spoon, made the food tastier (my personal view). We arrived at 10.15am (Saturday 4 Sep 2021) and started queuing, around 5 people in front of us. It wasn’t too bad, it took 25 mins to get our food. We ordered additional fish cakes and fish balls. Total bill is $18.80 for 2 of us. Worth waiting and definitely will come back.

Love the fiery sambal chilli sauce that goes with the fishballs, and the noodles are generously laden with crispy fried lard too. Prices have increased recently to $5.50/$4.50, big/small."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd1BPamFnEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"A simple bowl of noodles. Handmade fishball and fishcake texture are great. Their Noodles not bad. And their stuffed daopok is nice. Worth a try.
But, be prepared to wait. Queue time can goes as long as 40mins."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd1lpNWZ3EAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Authentic Malaysia style fishball noodle. Another hidden gems in SG.
By the way, be prepare long queue and usually 11am already sold out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd1lYRVZ3EAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,Yummilicious noodle which taste really like Msia.  Worth queuing and seller is so friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcXVPUnd3RRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Whenever am here during weekend, always see a super long Q for this stall but didn't get to try it till last weekend though there's still about 10 person in front but at least given that only 2 pax dine-in, thus waiting time is not as bad.

Loved how they are generous with the lard and fried shallots. Loved their fish cake and fish ball too as you don't get to taste lots of flour but more of the fish paste.

Coffee shop area also quite traditional with those antique kind of marble table with wooden legs and wooden round chairs.

Will definitely come back again if the Q is not that long or if I""m able to wake up super duper early for this (maybe when I got the craving). Lolxxx"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRenJlcDFnRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,The sauce of the noodle is quite different frim Singapore style fishball noodle. With lots of pork lard too. Handmade fishball and fish cake are very Q and chewy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dHJxRmxnRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Nothing special. Precisely because it is not something special but a comfort food that you could (or used to) have frequently that make it special. Not something outlandish, but a well balanced taste that would evoke the feel of passing the North South Malaysia highway where you pit stop for lunch 😉."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0NktyTmdBRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Walking 2 rounds in Mayflower Foods Centre but many stalls were not open this morning.  So went to the nearby coffeeshop for the Malaysian-style fishballs noodle.  I had my dry mee kia with ‘一色’ yellowtail fishballs only ($5.50) and a piece of fish cake ($2.50).
The sauce mixture was slightly saltier but savoury & did not have any hint of vinegar in it.  ""Also no black sauce for me!""
It was served with plentiful of fried shallot, chopped green spring onion & pork lards.  The belacan chilli paste was not very spicy but flavourful enough.
The mee kia was quite similar to the instant noodle and pleasant to the bite.  It has seaweed in the soup which made it very tasty.  I opted for fishballs only because I don’t like Tou pok. 👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeWVfNVpREAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Worth the queue - tastes very similar to what you’ll get in msia, according to my msian friend. Will be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTZEVmtBRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Above average. Fishballs were super q. Other than that, nothing special for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTb3M2VE1REAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,Love this place! The noodles taste like Yong Peng noodles. The pork lard goes very well with he noodles! Noodles don't have alkaline taste. Belachan is on the sour side. Their fishballs has a fishy taste. Not my type. Fishcake is not bad. All are handmade. Came at early 8 plus on sat morn but still need to queue for about 25 mins. Noodle portion quite big! Saw the uncle doing ice bath for the noodles too
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bXYybXF3RRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Very generous portions of springy noodles. The ""bak yue pok"" is always crunchy and flavouful. The handmade fishballs really good. Slightly chewy and not too bouncy. Noodle sauce quite unique blend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxN0tIVUJnEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),3,"Ok fish ball noodles, soup base smells nice but abit salty for me. Good portion of noodles.

However might not be worth the queue"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeVBIMm1nRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,Closed on Monday. Usually sold out by 11am(before the 2pm closing time). Mainly for breakfast since the fishballs are not enough to last beyond lunch. Fishball are very nice. Real fish meat without added starch. Silky smooth and bouncy chew.. My favourite. Noodles are Malaysia style (black sauce) so if u like the tomatoe ketchup type... This is not for you. The chilli dry noodle taste better than the non chilli. U can request the soup for all fishball if you are not a fan of fishcake and taohu. $4small $5big noodle. $4.50 fishball soup standard size. Overall is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM0tDcmdnRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),2,"Tired twice recently, once on a Tues the other on Thur. Fishball fishcakes and taupok quite good but the pork lards are stale on both occasions spoil everything... Hope stall owners see this and improve on the lards, if not, better don't put them out to serve"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0dGVYVmh3RRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Pretty good fishball noodles. Ordered the large meepok and there's a lot of noodles plus decent serving of fishball and fish cake. The sauce is well mixed with lard and it's the Malaysian signature, which is nice. The fishballs have good texture too. Friendly service as well. Five stars if the noodles are just a little bit more firm. But definitely above average and worth visiting if around the area.

UPDATE: Changed to five stars because on second try, even with dabao, the mee kia was firm. Good stuff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLd19ETVVBEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Malaysian-styled Fishball noodles at 158 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4.

Many of my close friends know that I don't like eating Fishballs (except for Old Chang Kee's giant ones). Don't ask me why.

Ok. Back to this gem of a stall.

Queues usually start forming at around 0730H, and by around 1030H, they'd be sold out and that's it.

The sambal and sweet sauce combination is like how you'd shower a Muse with, throw in some Harp tunes and you're in Xanadu.

Taupok bursts with so much soup that it puts a good Onde-Onde to shame. It is swimming in a vat of hot soup, waiting to be served.

Fishcake is soft on the inside. Lembek when handled. The skin on the outside is fried, which lends another dimension to the texture. Yes. I do eat fishcakes. I'm weird.

The ""Pièce de résistance"" would be the Oinky Lard pieces. Fresh, crispy and oh so ..... generous.

Don't bother coming on weekends though. Extremely crowded and might sell out earlier."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTb3VHdmtRRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"Noodles is good and tasty, handmade fishcake is not too bad but the fish ball is a little fishy and mushy. But overall everything is good. Be sure to Q for a good 15 mins."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0dlAtanJnRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,"This is my fourth time here.The previous 3 times I was here and they were sold out. Queued for half and hour before it was my turn. Order the $5SGD portion but unfortunately they ran out of fishcake. Have to say the homemade fishball was really nice.noodle was delicious but was a little dry. Instead of the usual chill sauce for the noodle, they added something that looks like a dry chilli paste. for those who wish to try, strongly recommend you to come before 11am."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbnZHUGpRRRAB,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Popped by for lunch after seeing the reviews online. Fish balls were nice and bouncy and noodles were good! Decently priced at $4.

It was sold out by 12:44pm so my recommendation is get there early!"

Noodles were very well cooked, Al dente.
Fishball was abit mushy, didnt quite suit my pallete.
Fishcake was brilliant thou, strong and bold taste.
Must be there before 10am if not highly likely will be sold out.
Would recommend the dry noodle over soup."

It's $4 for a regular, $5 for a large bowl, the ingredients are definitely of good quality and they sell out by 12.30pm ish so be sure to get there early, I went there at 12pm for 3 days and they were all out. The noodles are made locally and their chilli packs a punch"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzamNiVmNnEAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,My weekly fix of fishball noodle. My go to place with my wife. Fishball and fishcake are all handmade. It's totally different from other stalls which use factory made fishball and fish cake. Quantity of noodles at $4 is generous.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeGRQQ1Z3EAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),4,"Pros: Noodle texture springy. Fishballs are bouncy and tasty 😋. Pork lard is the best I’ve tried in a noodle dish, not hard and dry.
Cons: I think the Tow Pok, Chilli and Seaweed is out of place. It felt like having a combination of JB wanton Mee + Teochew Fishball noodle + YTF + KL chilli ban mian.
Overall: A good bowl of Malaysia Noodle. Just not the typical fishball noodle."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazVQS0R3EAE,Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle (AMK),5,Delightful fishball noodles in Malaysian style. Fishballs are self made. Simply unique and delicious. Good to be there no later than 11am to avoid sold out disappointment.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcHQ3V0FnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday afternoon for lunch, not much crowd on a weekday. This cafe is quite spacious, have an outdoor and indoor seating area. I ordered the Chicken waffles Chicken was tender and delicious. The only complain was quite warm indoor, seem like the air-conditional is not working. Overall, wonderful place to chill and will visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHZXdU9nEAE,Cava Singapore,5,First time coming to this cafe and will definitely go back again. It’s such a nice and comfortable place to chill in..The food is nice & My family simply love all the varieties that we have ordered.. 👍🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzQtbk1nEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited them on consecutive Sat and Sun! Service staffs are friendly and polite. Ordered their mushroom risotto and truffle fries for both days. It was really good! Amazingly, their coffee was a gem for us. We didn’t have high expectations on their coffee yet it was the star for our brunch. The sea salt caramel latte was da bomb! Not sweet yet very smooth and produce good aroma of the coffee. Will bring our kiddos back for the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeThEMjBRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"It's new !!! Have outdoor (pets allowed) and indoor seating. Nice, clean, spacious and cosy. Ordered the all day breakfast set which was tasty and a cafe latte. Will visit again. Only complain was the need to improve their online menu with picture of the food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGREUzRnRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,We were here for the vet's appt and was so glad for a cafe that welcomes little friends. Better than that the food is very good. The pasta was fresh yet light. We also had the croffles with a very crispy chicken. I would have stayed longer for dessert but with the current humidity we have to come back when we can sit indoors without the little friend. Very good dining experience and good offering of wines too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDY2WnN3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday for brunch, was a nice and quiet place to chill. Really enjoyed the pasta, which is a recommended dish . Quite a decent amount of seafood (scallops, prawns, clams) given 👍🏼👍🏼"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHVPSlBnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,A nice cafe tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Consists of both indoor air conditioned and outdoor seating suitable for pet owners which is a plus. Ample seating space inside as the restaurant stretches quite far in. Service is good and relatively fast. Decor is pretty and they have interesting pieces of furniture and contrasting wallpapers and panels for a varied effect. Tried their speculoos latte and Peter’s Pancake which is quite good 👍😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPME1heGRBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Pretty good food and service at reasonable prices. The rosti waffles were very delicious, although we wish they could be even crispier. Pancakes are fluffy, scrambled egg is creamy, bacon is not too greasy. The melon tea smells very calming although the melon taste itself wasn't very strong. The online ordering platform was missing photos for several items, which made it hard to visualize what the dish would look like or the portion size.

Relaxing simple decor. The outdoor area is pet-friendly, lotsa cute dogs there! Indoors has plenty of seating. There is also a small garden area on the other end, with goldfishes swimming around in a little rock fountain."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnZxRzVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"Wow.. love this place for its space... wide spacious and hippy green ambience... Nice!

Simply the space and deco makes this cafe super comfortable to laze and chill in.

And I'm glad the great food goes well with ambience too..

Been here twice already. And their pastas and burger is great!

And their online loyalty program is definitely tempting me to go back a 3rd 4th time...
And its only tempting because food and ambience is great..

Would definitely be back many more times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3UzRUpBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Found a nice new cafe. Great food, pet friendly and can cycle over the next round. Just a bit longer waiting time for a seat so better to book advance 🥂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTlyQ21RRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"My first attempt lunch experience.

Personally, I like their main menu items, the savoury items are not to my liking.

Overall dining experience is good. Nice place and ambient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyekxpSkxnEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Strong contender to the existing upper Thomson road cafes like Columbus Coffee. Overall good brunch food, with nice platting and interior design. However could do better with their coffees (quite awful Americano). They should like consider providing better utensils (fork,soon) as the current ones are obviously of sub standard quality, similar to the ones we see in food court. It’s the non polished type and didn’t look or feel sparkling clean. Furthermore, all of their fork has stains between the grooves. Asked for change but all had stains. Ended up not using their fork. Lost my appetite a little. Chicken was great but wished they drained the excess oil before serving. The plate was filled with excess oil from the chicken midway during meal. Overall 3 stars with lots of potential for improvement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1ozQkRBEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Good food and pet friendly. Will visit again
Not bad for a 3 week old cafe 🙂

Update:
Went back on their 4th week of business with more friends. Waiting time improved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGFxeXhRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"A bright, beautiful, and spacious cafe with lots of greenery - reminds me of a laidback Balinese beach club/cafe. It has a open, pet-friendly outdoor seating area too!

Not your usual cafe fare, ordered a few unique items to try. They were all delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzhHM0hREAE,Cava Singapore,3,"This cafe is pretty near my place but first time trying. Reservations is recommended especially for weekends. Surprised that the indoor dining area was so big.
Found the price of the food quite expensive. Breakfast for 3 easily exceeded $100. They had a promo with Citibank but we had lots of problems with it as it couldn't accept applepay or if the credit card is stored inside the phone without the full 16 digits.
Order a few dishes to share, the one we enjoyed most is the Chicken and Croffles. Both croffles and chicken were well cooked. The Roffles platter was interesting because of the rosti waffles and also liked the way the mushrooms were cooked.
Service was very slow. Not sure if they forgot the order or what. The staff are all very young and had to call them over a few times to check the status of the dishes. The sides came almost last, the Spicy Chicken wasn't really nice it didn't taste Korean but the sauce more tasted like the Thai sweet Chili sauce. The Sakura Cream Tagliatelie also came late and serving was very small which left us unsatisfied.
Drinks were just pretty average.
Really need to improve on the speed of the food served. Not sure why the cafe wasn't even crowded at all early in the morning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0tDckJ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Lovely ambience and tasty albeit junky food, has a nice al fresco area for pet owners and their fur kids. Deep fried chicken and croffles very yummy. Fries were good too. We'll be back soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b0lxNmlBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Loved the interior design and spacious. Also has an outdoor sheltered seating area. Our group of 3 had the croffles with fried chicken, the crispy chicken burger, the rosti with mushrooms & pork sausages, chicken tenders with korean spicy sauce - all of them were decently good. The letdown came in the form of their tarts where the crust was soft, and it just felt liked it was kept for too many days."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGFMT2JREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited the place on a weekday afternoon and was delighted that there’s no crowd. Huge space with ample seating area. Had the fried chicken, sakura pasta and the creamed corn (CCB).

The pasta and chicken were great but the corn was just alright. The sour cream was not a good addition to the corn. Drinks were on the expensive side too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM0lXVzNRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Didn't expect the food to be good, but it really is! The chef does fried chicken super well. We ordered the spicy Korean fried chicken it was out of this world. The CCB is also super yummy. The CAVA burger is huge but also very tasty. My husband and I were stuffed after these three dishes due to the generous portion of the CAVA burger. For the portion, the price is very reasonable. The downside is the waiting time, it took 40 mins for us to have the first side on the table. We had to approach the service staff to check on our order. The last dish, the burger took 1 hour. Service staff is quite friendly and attentive in terms of refilling water. Easy to get their attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc0tLQ1R3EAE,Cava Singapore,2,"The colors they utilized in their interior design were fantastic. The colors are black, white, and jade green. This is a fantastic mix. I went on a Friday night when it wasn't too packed. ⁣

Dinner menu is so-so, portion can be bigger even though the food is good. Love the place as it allowed furkid to accompany the hoomans under shelter. Nice cafe in a quiet estate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnNmR2pnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"May 2022: This cafe has really good potential. Love the space - bright and spacious. Food was also good. Order the Cava Burger (chicken thigh) and the wild mushroom pasta. Both delicious. I liked how the cheese was melted on the bun and the mushrooms in the chicken burger. There is an option to choose wagyu meat instead of chicken for $2 additional but I read about how good the fried chicken was and hence was not about to lose this opportunity to taste it! Was happy I didn’t! Anyway, I wonder how the burger which included a slice of pineapple would taste if I had chose wagyu!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1B1SmZnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"5 stars service, staff very patient and polite. They have special food and drink. Delicious and satisfying. The pet friendly zone is spacious without worrying about rain or hot weather."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2FhaVp3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,"It's a spacious cafe with welcoming staff. Ordered the mentaiko fries - which was great for sharing. The salmon was well executed but we didnt really appreciate the rosti. Overall, its a nice find in the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaUw3WUxBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Love the recommended dishes : Sakura Tagliatelle, Cava Burger. Food is really good, best part I can get to see beautiful fur patrons playing at the outdoor area. Didn't enjoy the lemon meringue tart though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a09EVUZ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great neighbourhood cafe with brunch food. Rather big space lots of seating outside and inside. We ordered the fried chicken and croffles, mentaiko fries and the mushroom risotto.

The fried chicken was really well battered, light and crispy and not oily. The coleslaw was also a really nice touch cause I’m not a fan of putting maple syrup on my savoury food. I would say a must try when you come here.

The mushroom risotto was everything you would want in a risotto dish. Simple and rice was cooked just right (slightly Al dente but cooked through).

Mentaiko fries were decent but nothing special.

You order and pay through a QR code which is always a plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldDhUbDZBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"We came here after seeing Daniel Food Diary’s review (though we know to take all the bloggers’ reviews with a big pinch of salt).

In a nutshell, the food here is decent. Just skip the desserts and the coffee (which is a collaboration with local Hook coffee but the cafe does not have a barista in house). After lunch, simply hop over to Thus Coffee which is just around the corner.

It’s nice, quiet and spacious spot for catching up over lunch. On a Monday noon, it wasn’t crowded at all. We had a nice far end spot where behind the doors is the backyard with a water well.

We ordered the otah bruschetta (sourdough), seafood aglio olio, fishy business (salmon), roffles platter and wild mushroom risotto. All of us rather enjoyed our respective main course.

Thereafter, we shared the ondeh ondeh cake, yuzu cheesecake and a warm apple crumble and also had cups of coffee.

The Apple crumble looked really funky and unnatural (take a look at the last photo) plus it was too sweet. The ondeh ondeh was nothing to rave about either. Coffee was served without inspiration (no latte art cos as mentioned, no barista) - it was just bland, normal coffee but at a barista price tag of $7."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNThPX3lnRRAB,Cava Singapore,3,"Do reserve before going especially on a weekend as it can get packed.

First visit - Order didn't go through the online ordering system and we ended up waiting for awhile to realise it didn't go through. But technical fault, can't be helped. Anyway, reordered and our food came in adequate time. The spinach cream pasta was quite nice.

Second visit - Decided to try the otah, and sakura pasta. Interesting menu, both were alright.

In both visits, the drinks were slightly underwhelming. Nice atmosphere and staff though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb19iNUFREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went there for lunch recently for a family of 5. Overall food is nice and the service is good. However, and that is a HUGE but, the waiting time for the food is ridiculously long at 70 minutes after ordering!!

They did let us know that waiting time for food will be at 30 minutes or more. I think it is good that they let customers know that they need to wait. Hmm... but we waited for 70 minutes... AND even if there is lots of pre-warning or notification that food may take some time to prepare, waiting for 70 minutes for the food is not acceptable. They really need to look into streamlining the process or expanding the kitchen capacity to have faster turn around time.

Apart from that, please do make reservation ahead! With such a long turn around time from ordering food to serving, you don't want to be queueing outside waiting for table + waiting for food later!

The service of this place is good. There are many attentive young servers.

Food wise, it is tasty and unique. Some notable dishes are the Spinach Creatm Tagliatelle ($15), Seafood Aglio Olio ($15),  CCB (Cream Corn Bacon $9). We ordered quite a lot of other stuff too. Can look at the photos. Food wise, it is 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNXRDYmVnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Beautiful interior and very spacious, quiet on thurs evening. Food was veryyyy average. Melon tea by the pot, teabag type. Speculoos Cafe Latte was good because its totally not sweet at all though the name. Roffles Platter was very homemade... the roffles was not crispy and abit mushy. Sakura Cream Tagliatelle Pasta was below average, too much residue water from the seafood so the whole dish was very watery but the prawns were fresh. Seafood Aglio Olio was average. Fries with truffle & parmesan was good, very generous and huge serving, highly recommend. Visited this cafe to celebrate a friend's birthday so we also ordered a Lemon Meringue Tart which didnt taste fresh, below average.

Will recommend this place only for small bites and drinks. Good for a teatime break."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaU9XbERREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great all-day brunch and coffee. I had the open faced wagyu sandwich and my wife tried the Rosti waffle platter which is gluten free. Both are well presented and tasty. It is cavernous inside with lots of space and good ambience. Pets are allowed in their outdoor seating, which is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0tpcnVBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,A really spacious cafe newly opened just months ago. Comfortable and cosy seating.. serving great pasta towards the Asian texture. Love❤️ the small portions available for the small eaters🥰 #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcC1lQUhBEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Was looking for coffee after dinner and stumbled upon this cafe. Big and spacious dinning area. There is also a huge alfresco dinning area where you can bring your pets along. Very comfortable environment. At around 9+pm was still quite crowded on a Friday nite.

Cafe pricing is on the pricier side for this order. Drinks are quite unique. Ordered the iced puffed rice cafe latte and a hot speculoos cafe latte.

Puffed rice went quite well with the latte adding some texture. Giving a cereal feel when it is soaked up with latte. Recommended to try. Speculoos latte is ok but hope that they can be more generous with the speculoos topping.
Cheesecake is average.

Nice place to chill after dinner. Will be back to try their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnRLekl3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,Came with hubby and kids on Sunday late afternoon . Kids and pets friendly . Quite a busy cafe at that hour so I think quite suitable for noisy kids to dine in . Ambience was great as I faced to a small tropical garden ! Love the plants especially for plant lovers . haha . I think chicken croffle was not bad-recommended . English BF and spam fries soso. Cappucino can be better ( quite bitter ) as I think the other cafe around the corner has better coffee . I was expecting better coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ2ZiYnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Great ambience, nice deco plus 5 stars for presentation! Melted nacho cheese dripped over the entire Wagyu burger served with fries. Lovely idea. Was expected a patty but it was yakiniku Wagyu but I'm not complaining cos it was well done. Impressive. Just didn't like that fries served was only warm, likely fried and put aside for quite a while. Waffle and chicken wasn't that fantastic according to my lunch companion. But still, decent for sure. Wash it all down with a pint for a wonderful dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDc2NkZREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Celebrated Father’s Day here. Coming here to try the food because it’s recommended by danielfooddiary. The food is fantastic. We tried the otah bread, ice latte, croffle chicken & seafood pasta. Price wise is $20 ish per pax. Ambience is good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNFoyUnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,Pet friendly cafe in a quiet neighborhood. Quality of food is better than expected but selection range not wide- wish they have more desserts choices~
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaUxDWlNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Had the mushroom linguine, mentaiko fries and spinach pasta. Enjoyed all of them. Portion size was good, mentaiko was very flavourful and had a torched flavour. Mushroom linguine had a generous amount of mushrooms and they were cooked well without too much of an earthy taste.

Could improve the acoustics in the restaurant though as there were not many people but it was very noisy. Good place to hold events but if it's so echoey it will not be conducive.

Do check out the well. It had a few dead leaves though. And the door to the back garden was locked.

Also there was a super smiley server, she was really cheerful, wish all servers were like her."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM09qcXRRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Good cafe, good choice of items/menu and friendly staff. Prices very acceptable for this area as well. We had the chicken croffles and the otah bruschetta, both tasted really good. Don't know what it is, but it's just missing the x-factor for a five star review."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM1BiRWRREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Food is ok and environment is good. Nice outdoor place for people who wants to bring their pets over to chill.

This places serves western food. Can get pretty crowded and noisy during dinner times.

A little far from MRT, but this place is worth the distance.

Will definitely come back here for more next time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLU5ycUNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Food is very yummy, and place is very bright and roomy. The croffle and chicken was a big hit with everyone, and I loved the chicken burger as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3NHTjFBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"C.C.B was my favourite dish! Head down to the cafe to find out what I mean 😉

Attracted to the amazing ambience of this cafe! I highly recommend all of you to have a sense of it too!

- Food; EXCELLENT!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️ The food display was exquisite, the food taste just as pleasant as how it looks (I took video instead of photos, cant post it)

- Chill outdoor; can bring your pet along, I saw one doggo 😍 (it’s open 24/7 according to one of the bosses)

- Cozy indoor; the furnishing of the cafe felt like I was in a HIGH END restaurant with affordable food, there are high chairs, sofas, and other different types of sitting to choose from (closes at 10-10.30pm)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjZMYmdnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Location: Pet friendly cafe located near a vet, a small park, catsmart, petlovers, and a nearby cafe to chill with your pooches after having a walk at lower pierce reservoir, ample parking.

Cafe: Came here a few times. Cafe is very spacious for small and big groups but price wise is a bit on the high side. I find a cup of cappuccino at $7 quite exp. Got the caramelized (coffee with a whip of caramel at $8). Food is acceptable & bug portion but not so fantastic. Service is very good, staff will immediately ask a choice of cold or warm water, and provide a water for the pooch too. We'll come back for small bites and some drinks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWNiVnZRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Interesting place to dine at a hidden corner. It has a “secret” garden that’s quite cool too with mist timing. Food is nice and ambiance is cosy, clean and spacious. 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHB1SXVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"The cafe is very Instagramable , it’s nice for chill out n photo n meeting up with friends , beer r very affordable price .
Owners r friendly couple
Chicken is too small portion size can be improved, maybe add more vege to make it feel more worth it , we prefer smth that is bigger portion. Coffee is a little bitter , can be improved.
The English breakfast cauliflower is not really fantastic, it will be better if u can change it to mash potatoes or sweet corn or potatoes salad . The bread is too thin n small it will be better if u guys can change to a thicker one . Taste wise is perfect . Like a 4 star restaurant. Thumbs up owner ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNkxLS0RREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Nice and spacious cafe in the quiet Sembawang Hills with friendly staff. Seems to be pet-friendly with many customers with dogs out front.

Had typical cafe food with some interesting twists e.g. Nacho Cheese on Wagyu Burger, Rose Matcha Latte. However feels slightly pricy, even for a cafe, (~$20), especially if you order cmmon cafe food

Would recommend to try if you're in the area, and get the more special foods on the menu (like Otah Bruschetta) instead of things like the typical American Breakfast set."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGRLZFR3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,Spacious restaurant with a modern deco. Attentive and prompt service. Good food.with little pleasant surprises.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWU2WVpBEAE,Cava Singapore,2,"Pet-friendly place. I wouldn’t say it’s fantastic or novel but I tried it because of the good reviews. The otah bruschetta was thin and laid on top of a slice white bread. It’s quite hard to cut and dry. In terms of spiciness and taste, I’ll rate it 2/5. In the end, i grab it with my hands and eat it. I don’t think it’ll order it again because it’s not worth $18 (add $2 for cheese topping). Coffee is so-so ($7 up)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajdiT3l3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a Thursday evening and the space was quiet and serene! A lot of space between tables which made it a plus for an already dog friendly establishment. Service staff were attentive and responsive. Ordered three mains: Sakura ebi tagliatelle, seafood aglio olio and a small breakfast plate, found them all to be nice! Hot latte was also good! But apple crumble was very disappointing cos it was soft and mushy, hence minus one star!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPX3JUZFNREAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,South Indian food (Veg/Non veg) available in authentic taste in reasonable price. Amenities is good. Can enjoy music when dining..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzZ0stbmtnRRAB,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,One of the best south Indian Briyani i have had in Singapore. Happy hour beer added. Cool place to chill with beer and chicken tikka
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLb3RDdFpREAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,2,"Very basic eating joint. Nothing special not seem to be hygienic.
North indians might not like.
Dosa for 3$ , only Sambar no chutney"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdFB6X0d3EAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,One of the few places where you can find good and  affordable food in this neighborhood:) Staff are friendly too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMDYyU1ZnEAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"I went there during lunch time and they didn't have any prata, only biriyani, which I felt was a little disappointing since I had wanted to eat some prata.
I ended up eating the mutton biriyani here and it tasted pretty good. The serving was really big and it had cost me $8. My only gripe with it would be that there was a lot of rice and not enough meat, especially for the price of $8 for a biriyani.
Hoping to be able to try the prata if I return back there one day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbmNqa0tBEAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,2,"Pricey but delicious food.

Eat first pay later, no receipt. not sure if the price is as per menu.

I ordered chicken set ( briyani chicken) does not look like wall picture...seem like missing side dishes.

My friend ordered ala carte 2 meats and 1 veg no carb that came out to be $10."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaUxiSHl3RRAB,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,"Nice food options, great taste, friendly staff, bang for the buck, descent vibe, a tick on all the boxes. Must try place"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdGFHdG9RRRAB,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,1,"It's a pathetic experience with management over hear. We ordered food and waited for almost 45 minutes, we clearly could see that the guy who was serving food was giving orders to those who came after us. When we asked for food management misbehaved its not that he is giving food for free, we are paying for food then he is providing his services, clearly doesn't know how to do business.

Visit here if you want to see mismanagement and get misbehaved.

Good luck if you are eating here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNmNMMll3EAE,Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,Awesome and peaceful environment to have taste of Indian food. Customer handling and the way they treat you is nice. One of my favorite place in SG.

Good Briani"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dG9hQV93RRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,4,"Nice experience, walked in randomly for dinner.
Menu items are all indian dishes. Ample and spacious seating observed. Staffs very warm and friendly. Ordered briyani and meat dishes. Food was served fast and warm. Meat were fresh and very tender. Wouldn't mind visiting again. 😃"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cUtQYXpnRRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,4,"Pleasantly surprised, never thought such good Indian fare could be found in the heartlands.
- Plain dosai, fried crispy was delicious.  appropriately fermented, though a little greasier than I liked.
- Mutton stew grossly under-marketed.  Super delicious...why it is obscured with zero description and photos is anyone's guess.
- Rawa dosai was a little over peppered but still ok.
- Iced tea-O was too sweet.  both the regular and less-sweet versions were way too sweet.  better with 50% sugar.
- Service was an issue.  While everyone was friendly and efficient,  our server wiped our table (when clearing the dishes) with our USED wet ones.  This is highly unhygienic, and potentially a hazard to both himself and the next patron. He did not appear to return to wipe with another cloth or spray cleaner on the table.  Because of this, we deduct a star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MzhYeDlRRRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,"Second time visiting. Great variety of items on the menu, amazing food, fast service (food came within 15 min of ordering), reasonable price. Will definitely return!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejRMWXh3RRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,Food and service is really good. All the servers are very attentiveness will come back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc0phNk9REAE,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,"The food here was amazing and filled me with such warmth. We tried the teh halia, cheese naan, chickpea masala and mutton briyani. It was an authentic experience and my family and I really enjoyed the food. 10/10. Would love to return again. We left the store very satisfied and happy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMEltNmFBEAE,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,1,"Went for lunch around 12:45pm on a Sunday and it was fairly empty.

Upon ordering was shared that a number of items were only available in the evening and quite a number not available from the lunch menu (odd for a newly opened restaurant).

Waited close to an hour for our food to come, a family that arrived after us had ordered, ate and paid the bill to leave.

After a good long wait one staff told us that the rice we ordered can't be fulfilled as they have multiple orders in the kitchen (not sure why this was told to us after waiting so long and why it our order that was depriortized when we were the first few to come).

Food finally came, it was subpar some parts seasoned with too much salt and drinks too sweet.

Towards the end we checked on our takeaway item as well and noticed some back and forth- am assuming that order wasn't put in and that the chef just threw the ingredients together to make it then and there.

Shared our disappointment with the counter staff when paying and he told us the long wait was due to the soup my mum had ordered which doesn't make any sense because that was the first item to arrive.

First and last time here.

Might be my personal bad experience as it's a newly opened store."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyek1IZzJRRRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,2,"Went for lunch today, waited for the food almost 45 minutes. One of our juice that ordered never came till we finish our lunch and had to take away. Upon reaching the restaurant, though it was crowded due to mother's day, no water served. Looks like they are disorganized. Few who came and just walked out as nobody bothered to serve them. Please improve your service level. Thank you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LUlYZVNBEAE,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,4,"6 of us went for a lunch on Saturday. Ordered Chicken Lolly pop and Chicken 65 for starters. Both were really nice and crispy and well flavoured.
For mains.. we ordered Naan and few choice of curries.
The bearer recommended Kongu Naattu Chicken curry and Mutton Nenju elumbu kolombu. We ordered both.. nenju elumbu kolombu was a let down.. overly spiced and the mutton bone pieces were full of koluppu ( fat).. unable to eat.
We also ordered prawn masala and that was an excellent choice to go with Naan.
Overall, taste of most items were very good.
Food served within 5 mins of order .. not seen any restaurant serving food this fast. Excellent!!
Will surely return again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNVB6emx3RRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,"I have to say that this is the best Indian restaurant I’ve been to in Singapore! Have overtaken sakunthala and gayatri on my list. Their chicken 65 is so flavourful, very well marinated. Their chicken and mutton is so soft and well cooked. We literally ate and took away for our families as well and have recommended it to everyone who’s seeking authentic Indian food but tired of Little India. Amazing amazing food! I’m in love with their food! I’ll be back every week for my weekly Indian food cravings 😍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHQtamd3RRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,One of the best authentic Indian restaurant in AMK. Served a wide range of dishes and options. Try the Uthappam. It’s good. My regular local india place to enjoy good food without having to go little india 👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyal9DYjNnRRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,A cosy embience for family or friends get together.  Great customer service and yummy food varieties. Went for lunch on Saturday with mixed feelings about late waiting time and customer service however I  was truly surprised that all the  7 dishes we ordered arrived with less than 15 minutes wait.  Kudos to Mr Maari for recommending the chef's weekend specialities too. Will surely go for dinner soon.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNGVfTVVnEAE,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,1,"Was glad to learn that there is a Indian restaurant around my area. Am a vegetarian. Ordered North Indian thali - meagre rice portion and vegetables; besides paneer did not taste fresh or authentic - more like the instant ready-to-eat type. Also had Badam milk; saw the cook mixing instant badam powder to hot milk and serving. Quite a ripoff. Not stepping there again. Pricey and average taste. I doubt with such standards, they would be able to keep up for long."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOHRuNjFBRRAB,Nandhana's @ Ang Mo Kio Djitsun mall,5,Tasty food and good service! A bit pricey.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLU5pOVpnEAE,5G Restaurant,5,"Ordered Prata and iced teh tarik.
Affordable price, waiting time reasonable as prata is cooked fresh. Love the fish curry.

Ordered masala thosai and iced teh tarik yesterday, costs me 4.50. coconut chutney was really good.

No photos coz I forgot. Hehe"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMXBlX1VnEAE,5G Restaurant,5,"For me it is nice food Because it is vegetarian food for me.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXenBuM3JnRRAB,5G Restaurant,5,"I had the Dum Briyani Mutton ordered via grabfood along with some prata. The flavour of the Briyani is simply suberb. I love the rice, the spice, the curry, and the melt in your mouth juicy meat.

Also I had enough left over to eat a small meal the next day so it was money very well spent."

Since Feb 2021, they have all new staffs are working there and I am realizing, their food quality has decreased now.
It not taste good as before.

Don`t see Ravi also sitting there.

One Suggestion for this Indian restaurant:  Please manage the food quality and the taste you had like before.."

All dinners do go on the days; when they have chickpeas & Indian salad that go so well with mutton/chicken/fish rice set

my papa simply love the food there!  me too...  yummy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcU16QzdnRRAB,5G Restaurant,1,"I do not like to call others lazy or slow but their idle demeanor and inefficiency is unbearable and simply intolerable. i went to order 4 pratas and 2 teh tarik for take away during national day to celebrate this happy occasion but their service was terribly slow and non-chalant. Are your workers paid to  mill about taking their sweet time or are they here to operate an FnB business? If i am the boss of this establishment i would get rid of the whole lot of them and have them replaced,  it's like the staff just do not care about their work. This is the worst place to get my indian food fix.There are better quality service elsewhere such as across the road, I will not return to such a lousy place even if i was paid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMl9xdEdREAE,5G Restaurant,5,My colleague and I ordered mutton briyani for lunch. The delivery was so prompt. Food was still warm and smelled flavourful. Since the recent days I have been yearning for mutton briyani. Neethe has appeased me with a delectable and a scrumptious meal. I didn’t expect the mutton to be very tender and too soft. Boneless mutton. Very satisfactory portion and the mutton pieces were more than enough. The cucumber salad was a sweet company along with the briyani and the mutton. It was really value for the money. And not forgetting the boiled egg. Thank you Neethe for providing me with such a heart contented meal. My request is please do not compromise the quality of your food for anything at anytime. Maintain it. If not increase the qualityof the food.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdE5UbHlnRRAB,5G Restaurant,3,"While their food is good, the service is sorely wanting. They are not friendly and don't know manners. They can't smile and they serve the customer just like a robot. An attitude and gratitude change will help."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTNEtLZjVnRRAB,5G Restaurant,1,"Tried their chicken Murtabak, it was quite disappointing. At the first look, it seems good, but when I tried the first bite, it was tasteless and the flour is soggy, not crispy as all. The chicken meat was bland, and it breaks up into pieces easily. At the price of $7.00, I do not think it was worth it."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMjU3Z3FnRRAB,Aman Restaurant,4,"Passed by this area, so decided to try out this Indian Muslim Restaurant since it was lunch time. Ordered Chicken Murtabak and it turned out surprisingly good. Freshly made upon order, you will get an enormous Murtabak, almost the size of an A4 paper, and it was packed with evenly spreaded scrambled eggs, onions and chicken meat. The dough which was not too thick, had a buttery fragrance which was intriguingly delicious even you eat it on its own. Reasonably priced at $6.00, I think the food was really value for money. Do give them a try, when you are around this area."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczZxUTFnRRAB,Srisun Express,1,The female Indian cashier gave 12 X 10 cent coins in change when I bought something for 80 cents with a $2 note... And her drawer had packets of coins in bigger denominations.. she was simply lazy to open them!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXBiaVR3EAE,Srisun Express,1,"They charge $60 and food is not delivered. The guy on phone rudely says, its not his problem, contact grab and grab does not pick up the phone. He said money can't be refunded nor they can deliver food. Can't believe such things are happening in Singapore. Just lost $60."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbGZTYm5nRRAB,Srisun Express,5,Good food. Always consistent in serving and food. Love the 4 different types of sides (condiments) served when you order Thosai. Not many outlets does that. Well done.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjU3dnJBRRAB,Srisun Express,4,The waiters/waitress were friendly and helpful.. Thank you for the good service given to my uncle and aunty who are regular costumer of srisun. . They love going to Srisun.. And will come again next time when I visit. Thank you
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLell5Z3N3RRAB,Srisun Express,4,"Food options can look quite overwhelming because there are so many options available from Indian to fusion to western.

Latest dish tried was their chef's recommendation - maggie goreng. Can't really imagine paying $4 for maggie with no meat (but got egg) - but it was so good! Maggie has a nice smokey wok-hei that I was pleasantly surprised by. It's not oily too.

However, maybe not get the thosai here. Not sure if the standard has changed but I tried that twice and both times the thosai took a long time, felt like it was made from ready made flour and came with watery curry. Prata was meh.

I'd recommend the goreng dishes instead :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5M3JMa3JBRRAB,Srisun Express,1,"Had breakfast here on 7th March. Service was really tardy. Wanted to order a Tandoori and maggi goreng special and was told that Tandoori chicken is not available till 11am. Looked at the watch and told him it's 3 mins to 11am and then was told the chef is not here yet. Changed the order to just maggi goreng and Uttapam.

Uttapam came first followed by maggi goreng. Food was served without utensils. Uttapam was not too bad and it was my first time having them. As for Maggi goreng, it was very salty. Honestly felt that the price paid for the food and quantity as well as nonexistent service is way too much. I'm sure there are better options around."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbHRhbTlBRRAB,Srisun Express,3,"Always here for their Teh Halia (less sugar), gingery and spicy enough.
Prata is usually alright, pretty standard. Sometimes I'll get the honey tissue prata to snack on while chit-chatting.
Thosai is a good choice too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMnBicnR3RRAB,Srisun Express,1,"1 masala thosai is 4sgd. Will you buy??? Simply not worth it.
Honest opinion, the food taste for the curries, mutton, and chicken chicken gravy are really good. However when it comes to the goreng stuff, it is tasteless. Basically Overrated and over priced. I do buy their food once or twice a month, as much as I wanted to avoid getting food from there, for some reason... i became helpless at times due to time constraint and it is the only mamak shop available at my area.
They don't have everything which is listed in the menu.
I usually don't dine in, as I stay nearby. But that particularly day I decided to dine in and Ordered the impossible Rogan Josh and a plain thosai. I waited 20mins with the thosai to eat it with the plant base rogan josh. I'm not exaggerating with the timing. I finished my tea waiting for the Rogan josh gravy, I received a plate of impossible roti John 20mins later, And the staff insist that it was what I ordered, then when checked at the cashier, they still kept my order which I wrote with the pencil on the order pad they provided. Found out that the Indian lady (new staff) keyed in my order wrongly, sadly No apologies extended..
A short guy with medium length hair, who i noticed been there with AMK Srisun for long from pre covid, approached. He ask the lady very angrily about the order and shows unhappiness even before I say something.. Honestly I wasn't even complaining when I had to wait 20min for the gravy, but what pisses me off was, when he replied me that they don't have the impossible Rogan Josh With his stern face he asked whether I still want the roti John or not.. I replied him that was not what I ordered..He said ok no problem, and start to process the refund and the lady at cashier keeps apologising to him. I was Worried the new lady staff at cashier would be in trouble for this incident and I told this guy I will just take away that roti John since they already prepared. I asked him to pack it. I also asked Him For some fish curry for my cold thosai. He immediately served it to me. There was no thank You or sorry which is what lacking in these service staff. I remember that I even helped Him by moving myself to another table when he approached me, since there was a big group came later than me, Who needed  the table to be combined.
Anyway this  wasn't the only reason why I end up in Google Review, but It is mainly because I often hear my mum complains that these Srisun workers are very rude.. And sometimes intentionally talking unhappily and sarcastically whenever my mum is there to get her food for work, which is very disturbing while waiting there. She felt intimidated by the way they talk and treat her, I hoping that  something could be done, hope they treat and respect all customers fair and adequately."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd2NEZXRnRRAB,Srisun Express,5,"The service is great, and the food is flavorful. It can get really crowded at times, but you can pre-order dishes for takeaway to beat the crowds if you are in a hurry, most of the staff here are bilingual, trilingual and even multilingual beyond that, so communication is easy for people of most backgrounds in Singapore"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeHFEdUxnEAE,Srisun Express,1,Was there on 11/2/22 late evening. Upon payment was told  payment by cash as NETS unacceptable. Ridiculous made me to travel to  nearest ATM to withdraw my cash. Please address this matter to your staff that's customer convenient is priority. Will never ever return to this outlet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdG8tT1ZBEAE,Srisun Express,1,"Eaten sambal chicken biryani. Sambal sauce salty too the max. Chicken too tough, leftover chicken???😑😑😑
$9 for a no standard briyani. Next time pls never bring me here again😖"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDYtTXVBRRAB,Srisun Express,3,You can try the prata because it's really good but not the western food. Very expensive (range between $8-$15)

And the curry taste weird. My husband and i wasnt even full after eating the pratas. And they charged me $7.80 for the pratas which is not worth at all. I will not buy from here again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycHRIOHJRRRAB,Srisun Express,5,"Nice, well-managed outlet with good food and drinks which are promptly prepared and served."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta0ozbEFnEAE,Srisun Express,1,Overpriced and underwhelming food. Have to wait forever for your order even when the place is called express. Save your money and time from this restaurant. Do not recommend at all.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyLS0yS2l3RRAB,Srisun Express,5,Service is good food even better. Might get crowded at night
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaVlDa0d3EAE,Srisun Express,1,"Food mediocre, yet had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for the food to be served. Coin prata came within 10 mins of ordering, which was reasonable. However, later on we had to remind them that we had another 2 dishes that weren’t served. Furthermore, the chicken briyani was already cooked and shouldn’t take so long to serve. However, that wasn’t the worst part, we ordered at 1527 and the ikan bilis white bee Hoon was only served at 1402. Everyone else had already eaten finish and only then had it been served which is absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, it seems as though the oil they used to cook the beehoon was reused as there was a rather strong odour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzOE8zMkZREAE,Srisun Express,1,Horrible food.. So much expensive and worst still rude staff
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNXRxVkFnEAE,Srisun Express,5,Always come during early in the morning after work. Good customer service even though it's just a mamak shop. The server is very polite. The food is..... SUPERB. Their potion of food is enough for 1 person & i'll tell you it will make you full. Really happy to eat there. Will come more often ❤
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN0tEU3NnRRAB,Srisun Express,3,"Just an average eatery outlet, however unless you get a seat outdoor, inside is pretty warm to enjoy your meal in this present weather condition. It us a bit difficult to enjoy your food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4aC15M1BBEAE,Srisun Express,1,"Food is good, but unfortunately preparations for take out in general are very tardy, and they may cause waits for over an hour. 30+ minute to over an hour wait are not exclusive cases either, and happens more often than I'd like

Staff are very nonchalant. They tend to ignore orders until customer(s) assert some form of urged communication"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmJmVVlBEAE,Srisun Express,5,"From pratas to biryanis, Srisun got you covered. You can get indian rojak, mutton soup, murtabak, mee goreng roti john and thosai to fulfil any craving of the hour at this 24hr joint. Don't forget to take on a hot cup of tea or a delectable serving of Milo Dinosaur with your meal."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtLXBibjV3RRAB,Srisun Express,2,Ordered in through Foodpanda. Maggie Goreng was tastless. Not sure if they deserve the 2 stars even.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aVBuRXB3RRAB,Srisun Express,5,Srisun brand says it all..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNjdtNVR3EAE,Srisun Express,1,Lousy service. So many times the staff at the AMK branch pretended not to see you even though you waved at them! Today i feel like eating Indian food so I decided to give them another chance. I went to the counter and told him I want to takeaway a packet of mee goreng and 2 egg prata. The cashier at that time was not attending to any customers but chit chatting with his colleague in the kitchen. To my disappointment he pretended not to hear me. I repeated my order and he completely ignored me! Eventually I walked away without ordering. It’s ashamed that most F&B bosses are suffering huge losses at this period but the attitude of his staff is driving his business away.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHNDdlNnEAE,Srisun Express,3,"not bad but Mutton Curry too salty. Portion is small, price abit in higher side. Suitable for people who are not so hungry as a supper."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRMXI3T2ZREAE,Srisun Express,1,"Very lazy staff, apparently my takeaway order was on the table for a good 10 minutes while the staff was talking to each other before they went to check it and gave the food to me.

This is not the first incident I've experienced with this outlet, both from me and my friends. There has been times that they forgot our order to the point where I had to wait for 30 mins before they were done with the order, granted it was busy when that particular incident happened.

The only time you can get good service from them is when there's no one at the outlet. Maybe they will only make the effort when there's no business there.

If you really want to eat at Srisun, just make the effort to go to the Serangoon Garden outlet. I have experience good service there so I don't understand why the standards are not the same for all their outlets."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNTlYemxBRRAB,Srisun Express,3,"Had prata,impossible rogan josh,takeway impossible mee goreng.
Prata was ok standard,impossible rogan josh was very good gravy was thick smooth taste was very delighful.
But the mee goreng was was big let down there was this smell the chye sim was green yellow dry at rottening stage the sauce was spoil and impossible meat was nowhere to be seen.Had to throw away it was impossible to eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLX195OFhREAE,Srisun Express,3,"I ordered this morning some poori and it was good together with the side dish of potatoe.
I ordered again this evening Poori together with mee goreng.
However the mee goreng was too saltish.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3cUozNG1RRRAB,Srisun Express,3,Average Indian food. Was told chef different so tissue prata was different from usual as well?
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NXV6WjF3RRAB,Srisun Express,5,These 'macha' are friendly. Crowd magnet. Food rating is 8/10. I just like the ambience where you can lepak with buddies for 1 or 2 teh tarik. Not too much ah.. Must take care of health oso
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNnFHREN3EAE,Srisun Express,3,"A small cafe which opens 24 hrs , standard food, price reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaWRycUZREAE,Srisun Express,3,"I got Biryani rice with mutton last night from this restaurant.
Its tasty but bit disappointed with more quantity of potato than mutton pieces in the dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdHNHSGJnEAE,Srisun Express,3,It is good place toh have indian food. But have given me wrong order twice. They should double check the order before handing it over to customers
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNnZtRnZBRRAB,Srisun Express,1,Just now i visit again to your sri sun express.  Ang mo kio Avenue 10.  Really totally Very bad experience again again. This time very terrible.  This time again same server. He talking with me like very rudely. Like really he don't know how to deal with customer. I am also from F&B dept. But this is not standard. Sorry guys. But now no chance to visit again and cannot give suggestion to friends of this restaurant
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOWZvcBAB,Srisun Express,4,"Food quality is really good but abit expensive compared to food  courts or other restaurants.
Also they need to improve their sitting place especially indoor."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX0s3b0pnEAE,Srisun Express,3,Nice restaurant. Quick service. Okay food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dUo3dFp3EAE,Srisun Express,4,Great Food and Drinks!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOEttaEtREAE,Srisun Express,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. It’s been 1 hour, and the food have not arrived. Wonderful service, terrible preparation."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX2F2Z3JBRRAB,Srisun Express,5,Delicious Indian food. Wide range food you can choose.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNnAzdk9REAE,Srisun Express,5,One if the best place to hang out after midnight. Relaxing and cosy even if the stall is a bit in small in area but very very nice place to relax.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJejg3eGtnRRAB,Srisun Express,1,"Ayam penyet super salty, slow service. Seems catered more for takeaways and food delivery. Do yourself a favor and head over to the Serangoon Gardens branch instead."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcC1iWS13RRAB,Srisun Express,3,"Food is great, price affordable just that the staffs nonchalant attitude .. Talking among themselves until you raised your voice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteHBlUklREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"Nostalgic old school feel to the place adds to the good traditional flavours. Pay after eating. So far only tried and like in order of preference byriani with butter chicken ($6), curry chicken ($6), lamb shank ($12.9). Byriani rice is light and separated well, not clumped together. IMO the prata is also good - my goto place now for prata for taste, portion and price ($1/pc for plain).  IMO sufficient portion for the price across the menu. Place appears to struggle with volume though... did I say old school. Hope they keep the taste, qty and ingredients if/when they do modernise the sales system."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMktuVjZ3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"Had a sumptuous breakfast: Lamb Shank, Egg Prata and Teh Halia.  The lamb shank is huge with chunky meat packed with spicy favours.  Egg Prata is crispy and yummy. However, the ginger milk tea lacks the punchy favour.  Friendly and prompt services made a pleasant dining experience.  Will sure be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTc29qcDN3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"The food here is scrumptious. Very generous amount of food that will surely fill you up. Bought similar food from this store and another just down the lane.

Ordered a full chicken piece from both sides, similar sized. The other side cut the chicken in half and served.

Al Zouq gave me a full piece. Every customer at his store received a huge lamb shank, or chicken piece. Price difference was $1.50. Worth it!

Will definitely recommend this store. 👍🔥🔥🔥"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MFBxaDBnRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,3,"Update: FB page owner had informed me that he had sold to new owner. He got new owner to call me and refunded the cost. Amended from 1 star to 3 star.

Be warned if you are eating there for the first time! Super sweet like hell drinks and dishonest business with super long queue wth service preference going towards eat in and same skin colour.

I ordered face to face at counter yesterday for takeaway with the following food.
2 garlic naans
2 plain means
1 chicken tika
1 panner tika masala
2 hot tea
Paid $20 worth of CDC vouchers and $4.40 cash

The drinks are so sweet that one can be an instant diabetic upon first mouthful.

As for the food, I only got 4 naans and 1 chickpea curry instead?!?!?

Avoid at all cost."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cjdmWUFREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,1,"Went there after watching the amk fireworks for national day.
Not the best place for service or food..
If an Indian Muslim place can't get the parata right, it's definitely a place to avoid.
The service us very slow, no staff to take the order I had to chase the cook to take my order directly.

They are so understaffed that you could walk away without paying a dime."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3ZxN3BnRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,Not bad. With good Dum briyani and local dishes. Halal. Clean.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnJiM2FREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,3,"This is only the second time I've been here but the last time was at least 6 months ago. In that time, the service has become a bit lackluster and food preparation time has taken a lot longer. The food quality is still as good if not better.  Now with the market being closed for renovation, this is one of the limited options you have for Indian food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNUo2RDJRRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"Never knew Mutton can be so tender. Had the mutton hot plate and the naan was the best I’ve had-garlicky, fresh and warm! Chicken tandoori too sweet for my liking. $17.50 including lime juice for 2 pax. Very filling but a bit salty for me"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eUxTek9BEAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,Both the naan n prata are good. Chicken curry also good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3F6R29BRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,1,"The previous store used to sell very good Indian food but not this new owner. Biryani was bland with mutton was scoped from curry mutton., clearly not cooked together. Butter chicken taste artificial."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c0llMm1RRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"staff generally pleasant. Prata, nan are good whole the bryani serving is generous. overall quite a good meal experience there over the few times, I hv been there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNExTNnpRRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"Wow.. I'm surprised by the Naan!
And Masala Tea is sold here!
Been here a few times but always feel nothing special. Until I realized they sell masala tea here. I loved masala tea and they did it well.

Have tried their fried rice and noodles but ok only la. Then today finally tried their naan and wow.

I ordered the Garlic Naan with butter chicken. Butter chicken is okay nice,
But It's the Naan that's special. Never see before naan is like that. Soft, Puffy yet chewy like as though got mozzarella but I didn't order cheese naan so it's not. It's just the texture of the naan that's somewhat stretchy like mozzarella , puffy airy soft like bread yet you eat and know it's still a naan.

Highly recommended to eat naan and masala tea here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MVBuQTJ3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,1,Not a place to eat North Indian food.  limited options that too very expensive and below par taste. they don't have price menu and they charged more then what they told me before I started eating.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpLWFEZjJRRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"The lamb shank is very tender.
Nasi briyani rice has flavour there. Was a bit lukewarm.

For $8 the lamb shank meal is a great steal, if not for the rice i would have given it 5 star.

Feedback to the lady boss... she was very responsive. Will check out quality consistency 2nd time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvZ1B5UUtnEAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"My wife and I ate several times there, the food was good (don't expect a candle-light dinner hey 😉 ), the staff very friendly, and the price hard to beat in Singapore (with rice/naan and curry combos at 6 SGD). I recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHAzNWpRRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,Delicious food! Amazing service!! Very satisfied with the meal and kindness shown. Highly recommend if you’re looking for authentic Indian food in Singapore! You won’t be able to find this kind of authenticity anywhere else! 10/10 recommend!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya1l1dUlnEAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"Service on the slow side. Waited 20 minutes for a dosai when there were no customers at 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. Turned out they forgot the order.  Dosai was the ""chewiest""  texture I have ever experienced for an egg dosai. Coconut chutney was tasty fresh and minty, dhal was thicker than most places (could actually see the dual!). Teh C kosong ice was disappointing though. Weak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN19TNDJBRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"ordered the bryani mutton.  the bryani rice is quite light on the spices fragrance. generous amt of mutton meat.  it's meat on bone which i like.  its tender enough. curry gravy was flavorful.  overall i would say the dish is good, but not outstanding. i would say the best in amk. when i was there, two staff were talking and they appeared not keen in taking my order.  after they're done talking, one of them then ask for my order.  the cashier is polite. dish cost 7.50 but for the amt of meat and rice, it's reasonable. will buy again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydTR5VDdnRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,Yummy butter chicken dish with tender meat pieces and gravy that is not too sweet! Will be back for more. Naans were also fresh.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMFBmSU9BEAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"This is my “go to” spot for Teh Tarik. I recently enjoyed my first Briyani Chicken Tikka. The portions are more than ample. VERY friendly service - they recall me by name! Quick service. You have the option of eating outside under shade, or in an air conditioned space. For regional muslim Indian food, I doesn’t get more authentic than this. This is one of the best “village” stalls that can be found in Chinatown."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOWZYekNREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"Ever since I know this place, I never stopped going here. As I worked nearby (Al-Muttaqin Mosque), I am so lucky to be able to taste from breakfast till dinner. My favourite? Tandoori Chicken, Briyani Dum, Teh Tarik and the Dhall! I will always help to promote to mosque goers to drop by this place and also, everytime anyone mention about Briyani or North Indian Food, Al Zouq will be the first in my mind and I will urge them to try!

Although it serves mainly North Indian Cuisine such as Naan, Briyani, Tandoori. You can still have your prata or Thosai fix here! Should try the noodle here too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdDZMZTd3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"Very affordable prices. Portion is big and not stingy on the meat. Butter chicken was so flavourful and was really unique because of the smokiness.
The lamb shank was really tender and flavourful. Loved it. Palak paneer was good too although I would have liked it if the spice was stronger."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMXBmMmFREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,Nice biryani. Friendly services.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaUpicTd3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,A nice quiet place that serves up remarkable roti pratas and nice teh si. A great place for a quiet breakfast or tea in the late afternoon.  Laid-back sleepy ambience for weekdays.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2VDTWNnEAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,3,Don't like the taste of the foods.

FOOD i ever ate super duper LOUSY BRIYANI fake dum briyani and fake butter chicken. The chicken is very dry tasteless  sound like almost rotten food they serving . BUTEER CHICKEN IS FULLY OF FOOD COLOURING AND  BONE VERY LOUSY FOOD. LUCKY I NEVER TRY ANY OTHER DISH. Not worthy for money and please AVOID to go there . Super lousy food and service so disappointed

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdGRqbFVREAE,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,"My favourite place to order takeaway butter chicken biryani rice and recently banana leaf nasi lemak. The rice was very fragrant, meat was tender and curry not too spicy. Can order small sides such as stir fried brinjal, ladies fingers, cabbages and dal curry. I wish their naan could be thicker so that there is more bite to it. Their portion is big and price is reasonable. If you're not a bigeater, $10 can buy enough food (without drinks) for 2 people. The male chef and aunties packing the food are always friendly. Will visit this eatery again!"

Will visit again soon :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1BLUjh3RRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,3,Not to our liking.

2 issues we hd ytd - the fried fish was hard n not fresh and d makcik forgot our Teh C kosong.
Pls maintain yr standard n you will last a long time here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMHQtVXdnRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,"Great food. Reasonable prices. Unusual but pleasant location. Nice ambience. Very gracious hosts.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5akxleWdBRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,5,Ordered the grilled chicken briyani and added mutton. Serving as large enough for two adults. The food is good and even better than some briyani restaurants.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3MEtXdHlRRRAB,AL Zouq Foods & Caterer,4,Good portions. Value for money. And quick service. Loved the beef biryani

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDZqdENnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Great place for prata. The Tissue Prata was really thin and crispy. They serve crispy type prata. The egg onion prata is delicious too.
We were first given chicken curry, and when we asked for a refill, were served fish curry. Both were flavourful and yummy.
It gets crowded, and there's not a lot of parking available. Go during off peak hours or travel by public transport."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbGZtOWh3RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"The first I came here, I could not get in as it was full and waiting time was waay too long for my hangry self. This time, I came on a weekday evening. At 8pm the place was half full giving me ample space choices. I chose to sit out. The food was good, not great but the prata was the star of the show. I had ordered chicken masala, which is a chefs recommendation but I did not like it that much. The mutton dishes and the plain gravy that came with the prata was nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa0t6T25BRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"One of the better tasting prata eatery in Singapore. The prata is thin and crispy. The fish curry is thick and creamy, not the typical watery type. The mutabak is huge and good for sharing. The teh tarik is fragrant and bubbly. The fish curry is nice too. They also sell assorted Indian snacks. The price is slight higher as it’s an air conditioned restraunt. Try to avoid peak hours ie 12pm, 630pm."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaTZ2VkRnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Decent prata and iced milo, however the murtabak is too dry. Long queues for a seat but it moves quickly. It’s a good idea to walk off the calories after a heavy meal. Will try it for supper sometime."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXXzYzSEh3EAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,Having a meal here is worth all the cravings. The Cheese Prata is very crispy and the curry has a subtly sweet but savoury taste. The Cheese Prata tastes very excellent and is full of cheese. The Chicken Biryani also tastes very delicious. All the curries have an authentic taste. The Teh Cino is not too sweet but it has a very pleasant taste of tea and milk.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcWFEYTRRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"Mutton Briyani is honestly a little disappointing at this price point. Rice was lacking in flavour and the mutton was mutton cubes.

Prata was also small and cold. They did not even bother reheating before serving.

There are definitely better Indian food elsewhere.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bHNPVG9RRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Ate there around 2pm today. Fortunately found a parking nearby. Last slot! Parking is not so easily available here.

Has mutton murtabak and teh halia ‘kao’. By default it will come with mutton curry. Asked for fish curry. Both curry is top notch. Had tried this place a few times and the curry is always top notch!

The teh halia is also very nice! Strong ginger and tea flavour.

The mutton murtabak is nice but I prefer the dough to be fried until crispy and it is not 😂😂. So the 4 stars.

Updated 23rd Jan 2022.
We went there for dinner today. All the food flavor is spot on and the texture of the various prata crispy and nice. The mee goreng also has nice wok hei. However, all of them was overly salty. The salt overpowered the rest of the flavor so definitely a minus point. So after today's experience, dropped to 3 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnFEMC13RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,The Indian cuisine is fabulous! My first time trying out and I am amazed by the flavour and quality of food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyczRXUV9BRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Great food and ambience. The egg Benedict prata not only looks delicious, the taste is indeed superb. Really enjoyed my teabreak."

Hygiene wise is bad. Oily utensils.

Last visit I order green tea… and in the cup of ice, there are seeds- looks like lemon seeds.

Asked the staff he say he don’t know… never even offer to change!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bE16WWFnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,Went on a Sunday afternoon. This place is big enough to accomodate many people. Our order came quite fast despite the lunch crowd. I liked their mee goreng. Murtabak was good but was a bit burnt. We requested for nonspicy for the kiddos and the staff prepared yummy maggi goreng with hotdog. Noticed different races dining here too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbklpSVR3EAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Terrible terrible food here. Ordered the briyani with Sotong and the Sotong is so hard and chewy. It tasted like it was cooked a few days ago. The rice was half cooked and was clumpy. The Maggie mee goreng is only half warm. Some parts of the noodles were cold. My drinks I asked for kosong, and I even reminded them no sugar, they added sugar to it. It was just a whole string of unfortunate food orders. Was good 15 years ago. It’s terribly disgusting now."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXOU9iSHhnRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,First time bought takeaway from this shop.  Most of the prata (eggs and plain) they gave me is burned.  How to eat like that. Terrible. This type of burned prata should go to the dustbin but they sold to takeaway orders which we can't feedback on the spot.  We threw most of the prata away. Worst prata and will be my last visit.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla2NEcTZBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Still nice after my last visit 2 years ago.
Always delicious and satisfying!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa0tUSGl3RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Seems like this is the only visible cafe around the corner surrounded by all the landed houses. My mom in law commented that this casuarina curry location is good because of the landed houses. I replied yeah but also due to the exit point of the awesome lower pierce reservoir trail. My mil and wife loved it although it seems to be a short trail maybe 1+ km only.

Anyway paper thosai is ok, ottapam (relive my memory when young treated by rajesh friend). Ginger tea are awesome after a cooling morning breeze walk!"

Personally prefer the egg or onion version as its prepared thin, crispy and long. vs the plain prata which is made thick and round.

Drinks are always too sweet, so I would ask for less sweet. Healthy living is the way to go.

Wasn't too crowded on a Friday evening."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NHEyNjZnRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Come here for prata on the crispier side - I had the kosong and the cheese + egg and both were great. Cost is on the pricier side, and the curry serving isn’t as generous as I’d hope. Quick service though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX2JxaHdBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Ultra disappointed! This family run establishment is a real shame when next gen took over..gone r the glory days..
Curry cold served, prata is like biscuits..n cold,,most lost important is they served all drinks n foods slowly yet the Teh Tarik n foods is cold diluted ..taste like yesterday drinks..the counter cashier stuck up, act like boss but apparently he isn’t boss,,slow, arrogant..
Believed they abandoned the restaurant standards and concentrate their catering business which is more profitable..
Judging on all past Low rating reviewers..is true facts! And management don’t learn to improve..
Bye, my very last time to eat here.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdHViN1d3EAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Everything is pretty bad including the drinks. Only the curry is nice actually.
I think they cant handle big crowds and just rushed to get the order out asap. Wouldn’t recommend at all. First and last time coming here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMXY2TVF3EAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Went all the way from punggol thinking it's as good as 10 years ago. I'm wrong .
Ordering - sorry aunty if I spoil your day dreaming at 1.15pm on a beautiful Saturday. Wasn't paying attention on my order.. but got it done.
Serving- was fast with my egg and onion prata and one kosong prata with a bot of mineral water.
Food- as u can see in pic is a little black with some charred black ash on it. Crisp...Yes it's crispy.. but a little bland on the dough. The egg and onion too was crispy but also tasteless. A nearby hawker can make slightly better one which Cost one dollar lesser. Curry was fish curry. A little sour but it's edible .
Damage is less than $7.
The *best* part was having my meal halfwaynthru and I saw a cockroach strolling in the restaurant. Hmm.. must be the captain checking on patrons. I got a video of it as I do not wanna alarm it. Should be the owner who need to check out his ""employed"" captain.
I was giving it a two star but dedicated one to the captain :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPekp2c1BBEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"Decent food but cannot deny a dip in standards over the last 2 years. Not easy to find tissue prata around but was slightly disappointed with a plain, tasteless tissue prata, had to add sugar ourselves 😅 Can skip the teh tarik too unfortunately"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHd2NqLUpnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"Pratas are crispy, but the curry sauce dip didn't impress. So if really want to try, don't take away. Only do dine-in for the crispy texture.

Tried the mutton biryani and it's not to my taste. The mutton is good (tender, juicy) with a favour full sauce, but my taste buds just doesn't exclaim with joy.

Return rating 6"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNmZ2MnB3RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Great ambience next to nature. Fantastic fresh air in the early morning and especially during the rain.
Food is good quality with nice choice.  Occasionally staff not willing to serve, otherwise friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2IzakxnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"Have to agree with the other reviewers that the standard here has dropped, and prices are also too high.

Butter chicken and ultimate murtabak (filling is mostly mushroom btw) were not bad. They also forgot to serve my egg onion prata and I lowkey had to argue with them for it HAHA but I did get it in the end la"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMVpHdENREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Ordered garlic naan. The naan came burnt on the underneath and it was bitter with every bite. It even left a bitter after taste that their iced limau did nothing to ease. I’m not even sure if it was iced limau or iced water with two limes. And I don’t know why the iced limau came in two different sized cups with different amounts (two of us ordered the same thing)

Naan was really so disgusting"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0xieFB3EAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,Famous for their prata but prata was served cold hence food was average
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXVHQmlBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Fast service, a bit long Q after 9.30 am, Prata good n the butter chicken so yummy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZzRpQ0lREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,What a fall from grace. Used to be very famous and delicious in the 90s and 00s. The prata was very oily which made them very gelat. The cheese naan.....practically had no cheese. So not sure what they served us. Drinks were rather bland. No wonder there wasn't any crowd on that Saturday evening.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3BfbXlBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"To be honest
One of the better Prata shops
Crispy hot (Most importantly)
Goes darn well with the fish curry (sour to kickstart your appetite)

Parking ample after 5pm and it’s free

Really can relax eat and chat with friends

Do come and try

(Non sponsored reviews, feel free to follow and discuss about food and places with me!!!)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcHA3TDZ3RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,We mainly ordered mutton biryani. The mutton wasn’t that tasty. My first time here so couldn’t compare and say whether standard has changed. It was just average.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNU5tV0xBEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,"Recent visited.. was disappointed with the lamb shank, it was not even warn..like a cold dish..Taste also very blend... disappointed and so expensive... However egg prata was still good..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbjdfMzVRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,One of the go to place after your morning walk around Thomson reserve. Prata and curry are okay. Like the outdoor seating as it isn't so hot and stuffy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNk5XbGRnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,"prata is pretty good and decent BUT the MILO TOWER IS A MUST AVOID. You would expect to get $13 dollars worth of milo but nope…the canister inside the tower thts supposed to separare the ice frm the milo isnt used, hence they pour the milo and the ice in the same compartment. Meaning tht your milo is going to get watered down AF. Its not like the milo is alrdy thick and the ice will thin it down. I tried it the second the milo was on my table and I knew the ice was gonna ruin the drink. Look at my photos

was quite expensive even for kosong prata. If im not wrong their egg and onion is like $3 but its ok i guess"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzhESW5RRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Improved ambience, more casual family dining experience. Great service crew, and received attention from presumably the establishment owner, who was keen to have our views on the test debut of the lamb shank, which we encouraged him to have it as a regular item on the menu. I had the briyani with the said lamb shank and it was both visually appealing and palate pleasing. I also managed to wolf down a couple of pratas as well. Am returning for a repeat meal in a couple of weeks' time"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MEx1MUtBEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"A hustling and bustling place with great prata (slightly crispy), drinks, curries. Staff is very welcoming. Plenty of seating. Parking is a bit of a challenge because the area has other restaurants and people come to hike the Peirce Reservoir. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LXRpZ1BREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,One of the best place for egg and plain prata in Singapore
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5dk5iLWp3RRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Favourite place to satisfy our Indian food crave. Bustling place with the aroma of the curries, chatter and the shouts of service staff orders filling the air. Service is always fast here and you will be in and out within 45 mins.

Love the fluffy white rice here, doesn’t stuff you out like other places. Masala dishes are all hits but the dry ones are more intense in flavour. Can’t miss dishes are the butter paneer, which is Indian cottage cheese and spinach.

Parking is sufficient but be prepared for a wait during meal hours and Sundays."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NnV2YXlBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"The food was normal not as what I expected. Serving of food is quite stingy amid the high prices. Ambience is just like at a hawker ctr but little better becos it's lightly airconned. Staff may be a little conservatively reserved,a smile could make us feel more welcomed. May skip this place for another visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc3ByOFFREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,"Ok this is the thing. When I ate at the restaurant years back, the curries were flavourful. I ordered delivery this time round, ordered a masala chicken, egg and kosong pratas.

Delivery was on time. The masala chicken curry was cold. It should have been at least warm. The taste, bland.

Hope they will make some changes and bring back the flavourful and savoury masala chicken curry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXVfdXdRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Nice casual and informal atmosphere, wide varieties of Indian food. The service is friendly and food served very fast. The lamb shank biryani is nice and good price. Prata, thosai, teh halia, milo donasaur are all very nice. Can be crowded sometimes inside the restaurant. Some prefer to dine in the five footway which is more casual  and relaxing. Good hangout place amongst the locals who need a nice Indian food fix."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaHZIQW1nRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Super Value for money. You can have food at peace. You can’t go wrong with your choices here. I love Teh Halia here especially along with tomato onion uttapam. Pls note tomato onion uttapam is not on the menu. You can request them to make one for you. It’s yummy. Curry along with egg parantha has just the right flavor to excite your taste buds. Don’t expect too high about ambience. If you Wana taste genuine taste, then this is the place to go for."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbFlYSV9RRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,"Superb quality indian cuisine. Located right between the junction of Upper Thomson road & Yio Chu Kang road.

They have air con seating on the inside & open area outside.

Ordered the $18.9 Lamb Shank to share. The best lamb shank I have tasted. The lamb doesn't have any single gamey taste or smell. The meat is just succulent tender & falls of the bone. They give a generous portion of basmati/biryani rice too. For the price I would say it can feed 2 pax.

Prata considered the crispier side which is totally my gem. $1.3 if I'm not wrong

The only down side to the place is that the teh tarik ice I ordered tasted very watered down even before the ice is melted into the milk tea.

Garlic butter nun $4.5 tasted light & fluffy but fragrant.

All the different curry I tasted tastes Abit on the sweet & sour side. (Mostly fish Curry if I'm not wrong) generally a decent standard restaurant price at a superb quality."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeXRPS3RRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"One of the heavyweights in prata in Singapore.
Prices have increased noticeably after recent renovations, and now is queue-order and pay-first, but food quality seems to be fairly consistent (read: still good).

Parking will always be a huge deterrent to visits at this outlet, so come during off-peak hours!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHFhU3lRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),5,"Always had a good meal here; although the queue on weekends are pretty long, they have an efficient ordering system, food is usually served less than 5-min upon order placed. Prices are quite steep with a Murtabak costing $9.00 but portions are generous."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cFkzWERREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),4,Prata was very crispy. Curry is tasty. Long Q on Sunday but short waiting time to get table. Fast service. Chicken bee hoon is delicious too. Will come back to try other menu.. woohoo
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcC1PT1NREAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,Wouldn’t recommend their side dishes at all.  Tandoori chicken and butter chicken were so dry that you can barely chew the chunks of meat. Saving grace was probably just the gravy from the butter chicken.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc2RmcTBRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Used to be my top prata go-to choice since it opened more than 10 years ago. However, quality has dropped drastically in recent years which prompted me to write this review after giving this place one too many chances to redeem itself. Last time, if anyone asked my fave prata I would say Casuarina. Sad to say, this is no longer the case.

Went a few times on weekdays & weekends brunch, and prata served was cold as it is bulked produced to keep up with the crowd dropping by from their morning exercises around the area. Even with this, service can be slow and inconsistent i.e., other people who ordered after you getting their pratas served first. Imagine waiting for 15 to 20 minutes only to get your pratas served cold to you.

Wanting to avoid having cold prata served to us again, we decided to strategise and go during non peak i.e., dinner. This time prata was served hot (thank god) as it was made to order BUT all the currys incl the curry/dal for the dosai we ordered was cold. They just can't get it right anymore.

What a disappointment. Its only downhill from here for Causarina if they continue to rest on their laurals and depend on their once good reputation.

There are much nicer prata, and prata curry around the area worth your money instead i.e. Al Rahman Banana Leaf Indian Muslim Food at block 603 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, or Sin Ming Prata at Upper Thomson. All the prata and prata curry is served hot. Theres also much depth to the prata curry!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N2NhSEJnEAE,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),2,"Been having it for years but the visit last night disappoint me alot. Plain prata size shrinked, serve COLD curry. Ordered their mutton curry, meat taste different, slightly warm, definitely not hot. Won't be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpeVBDcDhBRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),3,"Prata still crispy but lately a lot of flies (probably due to the hot weather) which affect the dining experience and they kept landing on food, on our straws and 2 even flew inside the drink glass & land on the inside. Quickly finished our food and left."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldThxcmxRRRAB,Casuarina Curry (Thomson),1,"Horrible attitude and terrible service. Will avoid at all costs. Says open at 7am buy the staff was inside and didn’t open the stall till 7:05. Yes. It’s only 5 mins but it’s the whole attitude. Customers are not considered anymore. It was raining and they don’t care about people getting wet. They don’t care and have a real stinky attitude. Really arrogant and not service orientated. Really rotten attitude. I asked when they opened, they answered me 5 mins ago which was 7:05am. They whole business stance is wrong."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycjlhTXRRRRAB,Spices & Curries,1,"Ordered a chocolate prata yet received one that tasted like a plain prata. I was told by the staff that the ""black"" part was chocolate but it was actually the burnt part. Staff ignored my feedback and mentioned ""today prata maker was a different person that's why the chocolate was very little"".

Refer to the difference between both photos of the chocolate prata from them and order it at your own risk"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bHFHc2tRRRAB,Spices & Curries,5,Food taste is excellent. Prices are really moderate and cheap
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla1BDbGhRRRAB,Spices & Curries,4,"The prata has improved a lot with less oil..had poori with 2 different sides of potato and spicy pureed veg dish. But most important was the great service,attentiveness and the effort of the staff who greets all customers in English and with their goodnights...prompt service too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3JmMnd3RRAB,Spices & Curries,5,"Loved the idli, dosha and meedu vadai. We ordered these dishes for our small Onam celebration at home. The food made the celebration a pleasant experience for all. Keep up the good work!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNmNtUTZ3RRAB,Spices & Curries,1,Terrible eatery! Ordered a Maggi Goreng that they asked if I wanted chicken or beef while neglecting to add that meat costed extra. Was served a dish of over cooked noodles that costed almost $9. Eat here at your own risk! Definitely do not recommend!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcjRyRmVnEAE,Spices & Curries,3,Had veg briyani here. Food is tasty but portions served are ridiculously small for the prices they are charging.

Just ask for some mutton cubes take away. Mostly $5.50.  Very very small portion ,a lot potato. 4 to 5 cubes mutton only. I was charged $8.50.   It’s take away. Not dine in.  Service charge??  Mostly I buy dum briyani from. Al haldeera Restsurant located at Toa Payoh interchange , basement.  Lots of rice. Boiled egg with papadam plus some salad bonless mutton and dalcha gravy.  It’s $8 to $9 only.  And the food taste so gd.  But at this amk.  Really disappointed and this is not the way to do buisness.  I took some photos of the portion of mutton will post it.  Pls pls.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcmFLSEdBEAE,Prata Raya,3,"Mutton Nasi Biryani

🍜 Food wise: Overall it was a decent biryani, it had some taste of cardamon, other than that, no other fragrance, probably too light for me to taste.

The mutton was quite good though, tender and succulent meat, with a good flavor of mutton!

The taste of curry was okay, it will be better if it was spicier.

✨ Ambience wise: Good place to eat in. Slightly cram sometimes.

🤵🏻 Service wise: Was alright.

💵 Price wise: $7.50"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaWR6dVpREAE,Prata Raya,4,"Came here for dinner.

Bee hoon goreng ikan bilis was not bad. But could use more ikan bilis.
Mutton soup was good and flavourful. Mutton was tender as well.
Masala dosai had slight crispy edges. Also not bad.

They also have prata promotion available only on weekdays. 2 plain or 1 egg and 1 coffee or tea for $3.30 which we got but didn't photograph cause I was hungry. Prata was good and curry was great. Tea was good as well. Doesn't have the astringent taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdTZPdWdBRRAB,Prata Raya,3,Mutton Briyani tasted good and soft but should have more given (accounting for the chunk of bone that comes with it). The bigger piece I had was 95% bone and the smaller piece was all bone.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOFpMWFpnEAE,Prata Raya,5,"01/01/2022 afternoon

finally, some good f××king food. delicious crispy prata not floury at all. kosong prata really hits home with its crispy exterior and soft buttery flavour. hot and delicious. teh terik and teh haliah poured hot and served, very yummy.

good customer service, friendly staff. free curry refill. fish curry is extremely savoury and piping hot.

standards have not changed and been consistent since 2019. show them some support! they only do deliveroo so eat there!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dl9iUjRRRRAB,Prata Raya,5,"Very tasty quality food!! Had the bee hoon goreng & quick to served. Bee hoon is soft & fluffy easy to digest. Cook in high heat & Still hot even half way eating, highly recommended!! Not much oil used to cook the dish compare to other Indian restaurants usually very oily is a great encouragement for the revisit. Price is a bit high with plain bee hoon with egg only at $4, but is worth for eating a delicious food in air cond place. So glad i never stir the Hot lime tea as a lot of sugar at the bottom. Hopefully they can offer more vegetarian dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDU2cnBnRRAB,Prata Raya,5,"Great prata place to get your prata and teh Tarik fix...
Prata is flaky on the outside and chewy on the inside and not greasy. The fish curry also deserves honorable mention.
Teh tarik really hits the spot... not overly sweet, fragrant and optimal consistency 👍🏻
Choice spot to lepak with friends....😄"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbUtXRFFBEAE,Prata Raya,5,Consistent quality. The fish curry for prata is the best. The briyani is 1 of the best here.. love it always

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydzRyazdnRRAB,Prata Raya,1,"Have been a regular customer and fan of their food here for the past 1year, but my experience today totally ruin my rating of them to the pit bottom.

Went in as usual and saw a number of customers at front tables sitting down which I assumed that they are either waiting their takeaway or some are food delivery people waiting too. So I stand at the usual spot to wait patiently for my order to be taken.

At that hour (3-4pm), its not crowded and there are empty seats and tables. Behind the counter, 1 staff is making prata and the staff whom suppose to take order is packing (what it seems like) a big order and so I waited patiently for him to be done.

Then two of the aunties initially sitting down which I stated earlier whom I assume are waiting for their orders, started taking a tray plate and picked their indian rojak along the counter area too. I didnt think much, and one of the auntie started queing n waiting beside me with her rojak.

Then the staff packing finally done, and first thing he raised his voice slightly at me ""you want to order, you stand at this spot la!"" while pointing to the spot behind the auntie holding the rojak. I was taken by surprised and assumed he meant I should be standing behind the auntie, so I said ""but I was here very long already!""
He said ""very long also have to wait what!""
He look at the auntie and asked ""Who come first?""
The auntie pointed at me.
Then that staff gave an LL face and said something along ""then I take your order la!"" as usual with the raised voice and fierce attitude.

I was damn upset by his lousy attitude and service that I told him i""ts OK, I dont want order already!"" And left.

Prata Raya, even if you have good food, with your lousy attitude to customers, you can look forward to closing down when more people like me boycott your outlet for good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeTZMUldREAE,Prata Raya,4,"Good Prata (kosong) and garlic, not so tasty kway tiao goreng, nice fish curry. There is air-con, and service was pleasant and waiting time was reasonable.

This was a bit of a random find on our way back from Singapore Zoo and it’s one of the best prata’s I have had in all my time travelling there. The garlic prata is especially delicious! They are the perfect combination of crispy with a nice soft centre.
I also have to say that the ice chocolate (not milo) was fantastic. I can’t have milk and sometimes that means the iced chocolate/ milos can be a bit flavourless but this one was amazing. Wish we had found it sooner on our trip."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWRfb3d3RRAB,Prata Raya,5,Cheap and Good.  Weekday dine in set of 2 kosong prata / 1 egg prata with a teh is so worth it.  $3.30.  Tasty asam fish curry
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcklQRVNBEAE,Prata Raya,1,"Ordered whole bunch of stuff for takeaway, including a pack of pappadum, 3 pieces inside. They took it to the kitchen for some reason.

When I open the pack of pappadum at home, there was only 1 piece inside. Perhaps the other 2 are in the pack of mutton briyani? Nope. It got taken out by them. Probably repacked and sold again. Come to think of it, my 1 piece of pappadum isn't as crispy as it should, it is a little stale, with a slight leathery texture.

While we are at it, mutton briyani's curry is waaaay too salty. 80% solid bone, 20% meat, tendon and fats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cV8yZ3J3RRAB,Prata Raya,5,"A random find stumbled upon it by chance on CNY, the Maggie goreng was surprisingly good not soggy and flavourful, the teh tarek hit the throat smoothly..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPczdiTkt3EAE,Prata Raya,5,Fxxking good pratas. I rate the best in the AMK neighborhood. Their goreng items on point too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOHJUTDhRRRAB,Prata Raya,1,Trying this for the first time and looking at the long queue so look like very popular. However prata is very ordinary. Got my order wrong. Long waiting time. If it’s good it’s worth the wait. But 30 mins doesn’t justify that. Better off going to the market and order the prata and finish eating still less than 30 mins. Consolation they do serve 2 different curry but what’s the point when it’s not nice. Try only if you have 30 mins to waste and a stomach for lousy fried dough.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdHNuVUJBEAE,Prata Raya,3,"Overall, a decent prata place.  Not too crowded, good to meet friends for prata and chat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPN3ZQZmlRRRAB,Prata Raya,4,"Yes it is nice, you can try it out by yourself. I very sure never let you down."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLTRQeXZnRRAB,Prata Raya,3,"The egg and onion prata is not bad, and I like the curry. However the mee goreng is too wet."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1enJHMUdnEAE,Prata Raya,5,Prata was so crispy and delicious. One of the best ones in Singapore.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJOVlmaXVnRRAB,Prata Raya,2,"Ordered chicken steak for take away, turned out to be potato masala. More potato and less chicken. Taste was satisfactory and still doesn't know how potato and vegetables end up in a steak!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNV9tbjF3RRAB,Prata Raya,5,"Cheap and good prata, air conditioned seating too.

Must order - mutton murtabak!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxM3BtVThRRRAB,Prata Raya,4,"It is cheap and its good. You are buying what its worth!

Pricing will equate the taste of the food. Actually, even better!

If i would want to eat prata in the neighborhood, this is the place to go.

Staff are friendly. Location is very accessible.

I wish though that the store will be tidier. Thus the rating is 4. It could be 5 if clean and organized."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbWRHVjdBRRAB,Prata Raya,4,Soup Kambing.... always the best comfort food.  Great taste. All that is missing is the french loaf.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN1BEWmJREAE,Prata Raya,1,"Garbage, even for a cheap Prata place.

One staff member sits by the safe entry and watches TV, the other little tyrant barks at you while you look for a QR code that they’ve forgotten to put up.

Meat is absent from food. Everyone is made to sit in one direction so it feels like you’re eating in a prison camp."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cXZqSVJ3EAE,Prata Raya,4,We are frequent customers despite the price. Get your sauce on the side for your roti john. You'll thank me later. The murtabak is pretty good!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNHZpSHR3RRAB,Prata Raya,5,Egg prata is really thick and nice...the curry is also not too watery and yummy😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cFlMNmhnRRAB,Prata Raya,4,Pratas are freshly made. Teh halia is good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNa1BpSUxREAE,Prata Raya,5,I love their winter melon vegetable. But its not always available. My mom and i would eat here after most of her polyclinic visits.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMVk2TEZBEAE,Prata Raya,4,Reasonably priced. The briyani chicken i had could be better if the food was warm.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb3JMeFJ3EAE,Prata Raya,2,"closes at 10pm instead of 2am on friday..

prata's the soft kind instead of the crispy kind, but okok only"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRODlqalhBEAE,Prata Raya,4,"nice place . prata is serve hot .chicken curry is nice and spicy .
a bit too pricey"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwb29tWU1BEAE,Prata Raya,4,Have a hearty breakfast as the food looks so appetising
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdk83RHV3RRAB,Prata Raya,5,1st time to this place also by chance as my hubby wanted to ear fried kway teow and bihun and also pack mi soup.He commented the food is delicious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NW9uaFR3EAE,Prata Raya,1,"Lousy food standard quality ...inconsistent ... ordered egg prata but turned out plain prata with some bit of egg at corner. Was told its like that bcos its busy period. Is that how they serve? ...can't do proper prata during peak period ??? Also most part of prata was so tought that can't be eaten!!! Lousy service, & bad attitude !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MHMybHZ3RRAB,Prata Raya,1,"I am a resident nearby and have been a regular at this eatery. We have been noticing poor attitude from the staff. If not for the 4 stars food, yes if you don't mind getting disrespect from the staff, demeaning looks from them, do patronise. They will make you feel like we are the reason for their sad life there. We owe them a living. It is times like this which makes me wish there is self ordering kiosk."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bzlQR19RRRAB,Prata Raya,4,Because the prata very nice n the place so simple 😎😉
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMHVPbk1nEAE,Prata Raya,1,The cashier indian lady has attitude problem at prata raya ang mo kio hub outlet. She is not friendly at all and never smiles when taking your order like not happy doing her job. I ordered egg briyani and charged me sgd 5.80 and my order came out the briyani rice with just 1 fried egg. Usually Last time they gave me 2 round fried boiled egg. I did ask her if there is egg bryani but she never even bothered to inform me that there is no stock and only have fried egg. Feel cheated with this overprice egg briyani. The management of this prata house need to consider this staff. Thanks
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc3Zma2FREAE,Prata Raya,5,I love their  prata and tea very  nice
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNeFl5SVd3EAE,Prata Raya,3,"Food taste good.  The prata is freshly made by order.  Expect to wait about 10 min or more after placing order.  Pricing slightly on the high side.  A simple meal costs approx $8-10 for 2 persons.  $2 for an egg prata.  The set meals looks more value for money. Though the place is usually crowded during meal times, the tables are cleared very quickly (even before my friend and I finished eating).  A little noisy here.  Need to raise my voice when placing my order and the number calling for your collection of prata buzzing loudly away.  My clothes smell of fried oil after dining in for less than 30 min.  Would recommend takeaway instead of dining in."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtazhMMFlREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Nasi goreng kampung and nasi briyani are my favourites. Kinda sad they have to close early recently due to some issues, and not 24hrs anymore. We always patronise this place, its one of our comfort food. Good food and good service! Hope they will be back in 24hr operation :("
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NmRPN013EAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"A quiet corner serving decent food. I enjoy the cool breeze and tasty prata that should be eaten promptly before turning cold and hard, albeit retaining good flavour."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaEpTWVlBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Full house on a sat night due to restricted seating arrangement. Waiting time to be expected as they were attending to food delivery orders. Prata and gravy pretty good! Maggie goreng is spicy but very little portion of meat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOTZ2d01REAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Superb prata. Slightly crisp on the outside, very fluffy on the inside. Curry is good as well and theres dalcha as well.

A much better place for your prata fix than a certain place two MRT stops down."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczg2MWlnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Very very good prata and teh tarik place. Came here because girlfriend doing manicure nearby. I thought it will only take 15minutes but Im wrong. In the end, I came inside this shop twice and to chill twice. Love this place!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NlpqQXJnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,2,Kway teow goreng is tasteless and there is no sign of mince meat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cHItaXN3RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,"I ordered roti john chicken with cheese on 27 July. Upon eating, I realized that they might had forgotten to add in cheese for my order. I approached the staff and asked him about it. He took a fork and poked on my food when I was eating halfway. It's so unethical and rude to do that to a customer. After that, he shouted loudly ""What no cheese?"" I was utterly disgusted by this behavior and I will not go back to patronize again. The old staffs before the renovation was so friendly and approachable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOUlQUzdnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,"Avoid this place ! Just had bee Hoon goreng topped with a Sunnyside up . Came without the egg and only maximum 5 small cabbage . Asked for the Egg, that guy just took from the leftover tray probably in the afternoon. And best of it with a the tarik , the damage was $6.30 ... Inflation ?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z3JPZVFREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"Love the Prata and teh tarik! I usually take out. If you don't mind dirty chairs and small spaces, you will have no problem dining in."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzLUxMWXZBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"24hrs. Great teh tarik, teh halia, wide range of drinks choices. Love their Nasi Paprik, Maggi Goreng, Masala & Paper Thosai, pratas, fish curry. I'll be going back to try more items on their menu. Very attentive service. Windy, open dining area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXRMZVFnEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,2,"Unsure if the worker’s there were lying or telling the truth but apparently they told me that they dont accept CDC voucher’s as mode of payment.

This is completely misleading as there is a sticker of CDC voucher pasted at the wall right beside the cashier, which made me question the honesty of the worker’s here as well as  the boss. Besides that food takes time to serve during weekends and thay you have to be upfront and vocal about your order in order to place an order.

To end off, Customer Service is at an all time poor 👎🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaUlQbTdBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Newly renovated! This is my go-to prata place in AMK. Way better than the one in Upper Thomson. Super crowded after the renovation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaF9xajhnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,Food is generally consistent. Prata is nicely cooked with a mild crisp.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMXYzdzZ3RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,Have yet to try the other stuff..thosai is decent. Not much on the menu is available. Nice quiet place for a meal
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzRfNl9nRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,Not much prata place left. Quite good too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNEptQ0lREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,Convenient. Just right at exit 3 at MayFlower MRT. Good Food. 👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc3ByRTdRRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Good place to chill. Nice ambience. The usual halal Indian food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeDd2SUNREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"I like the prata here because it’s really fluffy, and I think it’s better than the prata house at upp thomson.

the thosai was huge, but only came with 2 types of chutney.

great for supper as it’s open 24 hours!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzN3NDQ19RRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"My go to place of my kids want prata. There are stalls selling you very nice, crispy, and oily prata. There are stalls selling below par soggy prata. This stall serves prata that's just right - crispiness within softness. It's not overly oily too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcjZ6ZTlBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,"maggie goreng combo $8.90 - MUTTON IS COLD !!
soup tulang $5 - tasty but salty .
didn't expect much for the services . initially wanted to order tulang merah 3 piece $7 (only 1 person is eating) but they kept on pushing us to buy 5 piece $11 ... and even ask ""ENOUGH IS IT?"" ""WHY the rest never eat tulang merah"" even after informing CAN'T eat !!
and when i decided to eat soup tulang instead , the person's face who took our order changes . try not to push your ""food selling"" too hard when customer doesn't want to eat it . no second time at this rest."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcmJPeEZ3EAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Have to try their Remix Murtabak at SGD6 (with chicken, mutton, sardine inside) but take note different cook have different ingredients, so if you're lucky you get lots of sardine and cheese, which is awesome. Big plate, can share for 2 persons.

The staffs there are friendly and easygoing. Their prata is nice. Recommended for those who have prata cravings especially during midnight because it opens 24 hours daily.

If you're lucky, you may bump into Christopher Lee and Fann Wong with their son having their breakfast there too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJOU83RHdnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"Quiet, chill place to have your Indian fare."

Open 24/7 but certain items are not available at midnight."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOE5UdmlBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,"I have never eaten coin prata without sugar before and its the first time I hear them saying coin prata don't have sugar lol. Really disappointed with their service and attitude. Like literally think twice before buying their food.
Also, the fish curry has a weird taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNktEQmVnEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,Variety of Indian food during lunch hours.Reasonable and affordable price.Taste wise just ok..ok..and spicy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZeEx1R2FBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"Recently the restaurant was renovated. The good aspect is that this restaurant is open 24 hours
Food quality is good. They have verity of food which includes Indian, Malay, Chinese, Thai and western.
The owner and management are Muslim and food is halal but they don't have singapore halal certificate as they didn't apply for."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NEppSVpREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Prata is delicious, nasi goreng and pattaya are all delicious. A nice little restaurant at Kebun baru neighbourhood area. Nicely decorated. Not crowded during dinner time which is good. Will definitely visit often. Highly recommended 👍."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDN2FfdnVBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Prata is good and yummy.  They have just renovated the place and looks cleaner with more seating capacity.  Assortment of drinks and Indian Muslim food.  Price seem to be higher after renovation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNbU95X2d3RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,Nice food. Worth a visit
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpLWRETElBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,The stall said 24hrs open. When there after my work around 4am with my work friends. There are 5 of us. They told us they are cleaning so we need to wait for 10mins. After 10mins of waiting they told us that the kitchen are still cleaning & told us to be back at 5am? Really dissappointed on how they managed the shop.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3X3U3cW93RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,2,"If you're a fan of spicy food, this place will satisfy--unfortunately for us, even when we specified one of our dishes to have no spice, the dish was still overbearingly spicy! Our suspicion is that they cooked our spicy food (the mee goreng and maggi goreng) in the wok first, then cooked the nasi goreng, which was meant to be partially fed to a toddler."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMzlPeWdnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,Have tried their Lamb Briyani which was very tasty. Nice mamak place to have lunch and dinner. When I was there I could see a long queue so I assumed that this place is quite popular for this neighbourhood. My briyani was fairly portioned and I think it is fairly priced.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaFo3ZDJ3RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,"The food are not bad but they are not consistent in their service, for example, Nasi Briyani usually comes with the papadum but some days they don't give (not that they don't have). They charged me $2 more than their menu just now. His face looked threatening and insisted that he is correct. When I told him that the menu mentioned otherwise, he told me to look again. I didn't because I would rather let him overcharged and not patronize that restaurant in future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdWZuNHhBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,Honestly the nasi goreng kampung was the worst i tasted. Adding to that i asked for no veggies but mine came with loads of veggies. I hate wastage. The fried chicken and teh ice was good though. The food was quite pricey too. Overall decent.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLd28ybzRnRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,3,Standard Indian-muslim food options. A bit on the oily side. Birds do fly in to the eating areas. Staff could be more proactive in chasing the critters away.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzc1BfNW53RRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"Friendly place. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of cooked food this humble place serves. The prata gravy is much better than the one at Springleaf and Casuarina. Much much better.

Parking is also ample and convenient. Worth repeated visits."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJMmFHNVJREAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,Don’t go by Its long list of menu and the name that states it’s Indian. The prices are cheap but the food pathetically made. The mutton that we had was too hard to chew. The restaurant needs to improve a lot on its hygiene. They didn’t even provide a printed bill or break up of the items ordered. Cards don’t work here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVMnNpUjBBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,2,"So, Indian Muslim (Thai) food. Prata, Dosa, mutton, fried chicken, fried rice, fried noodles. The quality of the food, especially the prata varies with the cooks. Can be anything from above to below average. 24 hrs, so rather convenient. Don't expect good service through. And the cooks are always smoking behind the kitchen in the alleyway."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrM09TbGRBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,"Ordered prata which is served cold and hard. Vegetarian curry cold too
Ordered bee hoon goreng
Came with just bee hoon and some pieces of cabbage. Had to ask if that is all
The saving grace was the Teh halia (ginger tea) which is what this one star is for

All came up to $17. Is this expensive?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvajd5TEhBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Prata is nice. Masala dosai also nice. They serve other food too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwOXNtOVVBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,I like roti prata and ginger milk here. They have fried rice with chicken or anchve. Some have nasi lemak and teh tarik. Many choices for redidents and workers at May Flower station. Yum.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLX3RyZzFRRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,1,"Ordered chicken maggie goreng, indicate in the menu $4.50. In the end, chicken maggie goreng for $8 (chicken thigh with Maggie). The Maggie is salty and it is overprice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTd3R2OE9REAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"The place clean,and the food are delicious I use to go every day because I stay nearby,and I suggest everyone must come and try the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaFBHS2xRRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,"The typical Indian food store with lot of variety.
I have to say their indian food taste real good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeDYzOVZBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,4,Amongst all the parta and thosai are very ordinary with very less oil
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNXZQaDFBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Went for dinner, nice restaurant, cheap and best. Taste is good. Worth for money"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbDhXa2FBEAE,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,The place is located at AMK. Lots of prata variety and the place is cheap! I would recommend someone that is prata lovers to come here and try out their food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOGFTNnFBRRAB,Al Sahira Restaurant,5,"Great Indian food, mee / Maggi goreng is good. Rice set, especially with mutton, is amazing. YMMV"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1XzdxWXpBRRAB,D Rubinah @AMK,1,"Not sure if this outlet is newly open or what.

Went there with my few Indian employees...

Everything also like not available.
No Poori , No Chapati, No mutton soup.. No murtabak...

There are like 6 staffs in the kitchen cooking...
But seems like.. keep getting orders wrong...

The food... Is plain so so...
My mee goreng is tasteless...
And it is like...
They use chicken with bones...
Means it is like..
Those fried chicken they leave at The counter to sell....
When they cannot sell finish...
They use it to cook the noodles....

So as the same for my employee.. mutton fried rice..
The mutton was the mutton at the counter...
Never sell finish..
And used to fried rice...
Close to 4 dishes we ordered...
Are quite badly cooked...

My next table customer was curse and swearing.....
Finish his plate of noodles in like...2mins
And left....

While the customer behind...Was typing to his friend..
How bad the food was...

Left without finishing the food....
I think it was the boss that came up to us...
And asked why we didn't finished the food...

Saw that their other outlet.. got not bad reviews...
But this outlet..
The food is just really not up to standard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNEl2MklREAE,D Rubinah @AMK,2,"2nd time coming back after a few weeks. 1st experience was not good. Maggie goreng doesn't taste good. This time order prata, got my order wrong, banana prata became onion prata, despite having the receipt. Fish curry is too salty. Seems like they have a habit of getting orders mixed up or wrong. I missed the Malaysian indian cook and the local abang Malay guy who makes good teh tarik and teh halia"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbXFEQlRnEAE,D Rubinah @AMK,5,"Biryani is phenomenal. The rice was flavorful and the chicken was tender. It's a relatively new outlet, do expect some teething issues and be understanding. I enjoyed their outlet at sembawang over the years too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNXNHdjF3RRAB,D Rubinah @AMK,2,"D Rubinah is a well known chain of restaurant. However, the ang mo Kio branch is quite poor interns or food variety and service.

After month of renovation, the restaurant was finally opened. After 1-2 weeks of opening, I went to try their food and was quite disappointed with the system. Even though there were 4-5 people in the kitchen, I observed that many orders were delayed and given wrongly to other customers. Thankfully, mine was not. However, I observed that the supervisor (who was also the supervisor of the previous shop there) was very demanding with the workers though they were trying hard. His constant nagging didn't help. The food is over priced weighed with the quality given. For a mutton meal, the shop worker asked whether I wanted papadam and I said okay. In a typical Indian food store (even in restaurants), papadam is not charged but here I was $1, I only got to know it when I looked at the receipt on my way back. If it is charged, they should at least tell. The rice meal was bland. Since they are new, there might be teething issue but I hope they rectify and bounce back better, soon with a good supervisor/ leader to lead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteThXdFJREAE,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,4,"New management by AL Mubin.

Prata is good and now it's served with two different types of curry; fish and vegetables curry. Chicken tikka ia tender and juicy too. Masala tea has strong taste, great to go with the prata and curry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ejhqbzd3RRAB,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,1,"Staff treats customers badly. Did not show price and got mad at me indirectly when I asked and changed my order when it was too expensive. The cashier also did not get my order right because when i told them I was dining in, they packeted my food to take away. Food was a 6/10. Also it was too expensive."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleEtEemNREAE,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,1,"Do not order their Nasi Goreng Ikan Bills from Food Panda my first time buying give bad impression from AMK branch, look at the rice use curry and cook so little vegetables and almost blank, rice is so dry no much ingredients $5 expensive will never 👎 order again! I stick to my Bishan Srisun Prata 💯 better than your Al Mubin nonsense popular!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybE8yQ2d3RRAB,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,2,"Ordered the double egg cheese prata and it came very fast seems like pre cooked and totally no cheese taste and very soggy.
Ask the chef he claimed the cheese is grated into it I really doubt so cause I cannot taste any cheese at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1LVpiekxnEAE,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,1,ordered this for $8.50? 11 SMALL chicken? you feeding who? ur mother ah? rude staffs. claims 24hours but everything dont have. dont know if they’re purely lazy or what. first time coming here and i am regretting it he moment i see the people. took forever for food to come. waited 30mins for 2 naan. ridiculous.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NU5HTEt3EAE,Al Mubin Restaurant - Ang Mo Kio,3,"One of the staff give attitude just because we wanted to order more for the same dish. Not to mention, when the staff said that he would get back to us whether or not the dish still available, they didn't even care. So we went to ask the same staff, he still dares to roll his eyes at us. But food is good just that staff."

Standard prata and mama stall offerings. They're apparently 24 hours, so in case any one has a supper craving, they'd be open, together with the drink stall.

We were given a nice big booth seat at first, however due to my mum having some issues with her legs, she preferred chair seats... the manager gladly helped us with a change..🌻

🍱 Manpuku Salmon Set... the set comes with soup, chawamushi, Idako, baked clams, main dish, rice and fruit 🍊 . Idako was left out when served and came after my dad finished the set.
That was a pretty big set. My dad enjoyed it!😉

Teppan Gyoza was good, very hot🔥! Its 5pcs per order So good that we repeated the item for round 2.

🍣Sushi and maki items were all good and fresh! 👍
I like the Mentai Ebi Fry Roll.😍

🙋‍♀️Kids meal, gotten a Turbo Jet for my girl, she loves it. The set was filled with things that kids loved!
She dont quite like the fried chicken pieces due to the sweet sauce. Portion abit too much for her cos she is small eater.... but yes, she is happy with the cute plane set!🙆‍♀️

🍎Apple juice was served in quite a big glass. Value for money.

👍Service was good, Manager Magaret was pleasant, helpful and full of patience.. another male manager in specs (didnt manage to get his name) was also pleasant and jovial.😊

Upon payment, I had problem with my membership log in, Manager Magaret was patience and nice to advice me on what to do. I was asked to check thru the items before paying..
BUT.... Jus realised when i am typing this review and looking at my receipt 🤦‍♀️ ~ my last order for ala carte Chawamushi was not served!  😭😭😭.

Total $138 for 3 adults and 2 kids.

Wished i have more nice food pictures to show. Abit tough when dining with hungry kiddos.. 🤣

Nice! Will recommend! 👍"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaHFyc3hnRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"Ichiban is not the cheapest dining option around, but it certainly delivers in the set menus in my opinion. Simple, casual setting over some delicious food, sounds good to me!

Always a fan of their salmon don, will always request for an extra serving of sesame oil and chilli padi for that extra kick. Unagi is thick and lathered with sauce, accompanied with egg and rice. Soft shell crab is a hit as well, crispy and flavourful.

Overall, always a great time dining at Ichiban! :)"

Just like he is the only one who working like that. Give queue number. Call number, bring customer to table, help for any customer request and so on. Of course Other waiter and waitress is good also, Just lack of manpower on that day. Anyway thanks for the guy in front. U are the best. The food is very delicious. We tried the cold soba (i think this is how it call.) The teriyaki chicken set is yummy too. Will definitely come again. If u like sushi, there are so many choices. Suitable for ppl who love Japanese food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck9pNEx3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,oh .. great and yummy foods 😘. salmon are fresh and juicy. foods portion just nice for sharing. serving staffs are helpful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM1pfYXZ3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"This is still the Japanese restaurant I goto for good variety and good valued set meals. The negative point is that you have to wait a long while to be seated, probably becoz the food is great and value for money. Though I felt the staff should be more organised and alert, not to let some patrons laze in their seats for long time even after they have finished their food. The pork miso soup set has lots of vegetables, nice amount of pork and the soup base is tasty. The beef in the cheesy beef set, is tender and well seasoned; with the cheese elevating the tastiness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Nk9qbEt3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"Set meals are super value for money, quality food and portion is generous with  different varieties.Been ordering from grabfood but I think dine in quality is so much better.. only issue is there are lots of managers and servers but everyone is so u friendly and unattentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHM2WjVRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"I was here last Sunday evening with my hubby and a friend. The food was really good. We enjoyed it very much. The set meals are value for money and reasonably priced.Ordering is done through our own phone by scanning a QR code.

We were given a seat in the middle of the restaurant but due to safe distancing, we has to sit all in a row rather than facing each other. Would have preferred to sit facing one another so that it is easier to chat. Fortunately I was able to switch my seat after the next table left.

Date of review: 26 Sep 2021"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3RUWVRBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"We dine in ichiban for at least once a month and we are always satisfied but this time around, the quality of food degrades. The soup based dish has no taste, the kani roll became small and the ingredients became less, and taste is no longer the same. ☹️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMWNHaEFnEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"This place has been around for quite a few years and it seems to still be going pretty strong!

Expect to find decent Japanese food with generous portions at reasonable prices. They are definitely more affordable in comparison to other more known brands in Singapore. Although their food is nothing extremely amazing, it's still a comfort go to place where you can go without feeling too much of a burn in your wallet.

Their set meals are especially worth the price, as you can great portions at extremely comfortable price range :)

Their staff was super friendly to us even though we arrived pretty near closing time. Kudos!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyel9tNkJBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"Prompt service, servers are pretty attentive when we request to refill drinks. Food are good as usual."

If can, I would recommend to go early or during off-perk hours as there are always a queue and their waiting time can be between 20-30.minites. No reservation allow.

I really recommend this to everyone not to miss it! 👍👍👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNWViOG1nRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,Food is okay. The service staff blocked out the entire row of seats near the window citing that is reserved for their staff only to open it up after 5 min when more customers came in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybTZYV0VnEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Bad experience and service, the two of us eating gave us a table for two but really small, we wanted to order a lot of food so asked for a bigger table as there wasn't enough space for our food, but they would rather let us seated at individual tables side by side instead of a table of 4 with lots of empty tables for 4 as we were not formally dressed nor Singaporean and couldn't seem to afford it. Many other 2 people who ordered less than us (only 1 set meal to share) got a table for 4 and ate comfortably. The food was so so, but Hotate Mentai Yaki disappointed me as the pictures and the food really didn't match. Really not worth eating, will never come again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaWZUT19nRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Food doesn't taste great like before.  Standard drop abit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWFiNUNREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Average menus at average pricing... Quality of prepping not as expected.. but then it was advertised as affordable Japanese cuisine nonetheless. 3 stars because of courteous and kind staffs. May not return though.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMktEV0hREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Economical Japanese foods. Foods are well presented and value for money especially the value set meal. Just that the fried squids are over fried and oily. And not forgetting the staffs are friendly and nice at this outlet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNGZTMVpBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,Best for price Chicken Katsudon. Quality is consistent here. Been here many times over last 8 years. Tastes awesome. You wont be disappointed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc18zQU1nEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"If you don’t have the capacity to handle online orders, stop taking them. You are not only inconveniencing the customer but also the delivery person. Case in point, we ordered food at 5pm today (19 June) and the first scheduled delivery time was 5.30pm. Then it became 5.45, then 5.55 and 6.40pm. I am writing this is at 6.15pm. That is totally unacceptable and utterly irresponsible of Ichiban Boshi. The driver had to wait and potentially lose other deliveries because of your restaurant’s irresponsible behaviour. I will make it my personal mission to tell everyone about your ‘wonderful’ business."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcU5iTW5BRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"I have been coming here regularly as there’s no other Japanese options in Ang Mo Kio hub.  The QR code for ordering did not work thus a lady staff came over to assist with the order taking on the ipad. When she ran into some issues entering the orders, the managers (in black uniform) did not step in to assist to take the order.  It wasn’t a busy time. They left the lady staff struggling. I appreciate the helpfulness of this lady staff (Judy)..  The manager could  have given us another QR code to scan when i first alerted them that there was an error with the QR . None of the managers  stepped in to help understand or resolve the issue. There was also no apologies from any of the managers. Another slip of QR was then quietly placed on the table by another staff after the food arrived. There used to be a manager in specs who usually provide good service but he wasn’t around that day.  Judy was nice enough to come over to check if we got our food promptly. Kudos to her for her attentiveness. The same can’t be said of the managers.  I don’t know the role of the managers in this outlet - clearly they did not demonstrate service orientedness or proactiveness when I visited."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3NEWXdBRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"At this point, it is unfortunate that Ichiban is synonymous for awful service.

We have spoken to the manager after our meal and they were very understanding but this was what happened:

Walking to my seat, a guy pushing a trolly (with trash and a bin if i may highlight) came out from the kitchen and blocked the path so i went back and stood at the side so he could pass. I watched as he rudely used his hand to gesture to someone to move out of his way.

After speaking to the manager, it seems like that guy was the dishwasher and he was rude to the staffs too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXQtN053EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"Economic version of 🍣, just like our economic rice. Don't expect quality, but wide range in menu, great for quick fix and chill out. Could get crowded during peak hours as the seats are pretty limited and confined."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDclk2YVZ3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Decent spread of Japanese food. Sashimi is fresh. Personally felt the sushi rice was a tad too bland. Service is good in general. Won't mind visiting again

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaF9PMDNRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Super noisy.  Was there alone at about 3pm.  Theres this 2 chefs at the sashimi counter, a small build chinese malaysian and a vietnamese lady I suppose whom were busy chit-chatting all the way since I step in for my meal till I left, and still chatting!  Worst is I can even hear their conversation from the very far corner of the restaurant by the window.   Food is good I must say.  But ambience is a big minus!  Ordered a kimchi pot, a sashimi platter, a chirashi set and a soda.

Will go back again, but will peek first to see whether those 2 chaps are working together or not!  Lol....."

However, the unagi don I ordered doesn't seem to have as much ingredients as I expected, and was an off balance to the amount of rice that was given. Not sure about other outlets though.

But I gotta praise the service staff for being attentive! I called once for my green tea to be refilled and it was seen to automatically after, which I really appreciate. Thank you!"

The Garlic Chicken Wazen is very popular, and YES! you can't miss it.
Salmon Belly Mentai Yaki is also recommended, I ordered it almost every time!
Some dessert like a Motcha ice cream is a perfect treat after the meal.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaHFyc3hnRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"Ichiban is not the cheapest dining option around, but it certainly delivers in the set menus in my opinion. Simple, casual setting over some delicious food, sounds good to me!

Always a fan of their salmon don, will always request for an extra serving of sesame oil and chilli padi for that extra kick. Unagi is thick and lathered with sauce, accompanied with egg and rice. Soft shell crab is a hit as well, crispy and flavourful.

Overall, always a great time dining at Ichiban! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX0xyOTZ3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"Came here on mother day. Full of ppl but Luckily we come earlier. The person who attend us is very good. Just like he is the only one who working like that. Give queue number. Call number, bring customer to table, help for any customer request and so on. Of course Other waiter and waitress is good also, Just lack of manpower on that day. Anyway thanks for the guy in front. U are the best. The food is very delicious. We tried the cold soba (i think this is how it call.) The teriyaki chicken set is yummy too. Will definitely come again. If u like sushi, there are so many choices. Suitable for ppl who love Japanese food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck9pNEx3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,oh .. great and yummy foods 😘. salmon are fresh and juicy. foods portion just nice for sharing. serving staffs are helpful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM1pfYXZ3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"This is still the Japanese restaurant I goto for good variety and good valued set meals. The negative point is that you have to wait a long while to be seated, probably becoz the food is great and value for money. Though I felt the staff should be more organised and alert, not to let some patrons laze in their seats for long time even after they have finished their food. The pork miso soup set has lots of vegetables, nice amount of pork and the soup base is tasty. The beef in the cheesy beef set, is tender and well seasoned; with the cheese elevating the tastiness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Nk9qbEt3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"Set meals are super value for money, quality food and portion is generous with  different varieties.Been ordering from grabfood but I think dine in quality is so much better.. only issue is there are lots of managers and servers but everyone is so u friendly and unattentive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHM2WjVRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"I was here last Sunday evening with my hubby and a friend. The food was really good. We enjoyed it very much. The set meals are value for money and reasonably priced.Ordering is done through our own phone by scanning a QR code.

We were given a seat in the middle of the restaurant but due to safe distancing, we has to sit all in a row rather than facing each other. Would have preferred to sit facing one another so that it is easier to chat. Fortunately I was able to switch my seat after the next table left.

Date of review: 26 Sep 2021"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3RUWVRBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"We dine in ichiban for at least once a month and we are always satisfied but this time around, the quality of food degrades. The soup based dish has no taste, the kani roll became small and the ingredients became less, and taste is no longer the same. ☹️"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMWNHaEFnEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"This place has been around for quite a few years and it seems to still be going pretty strong!

Expect to find decent Japanese food with generous portions at reasonable prices. They are definitely more affordable in comparison to other more known brands in Singapore. Although their food is nothing extremely amazing, it's still a comfort go to place where you can go without feeling too much of a burn in your wallet.

Their set meals are especially worth the price, as you can great portions at extremely comfortable price range :)

Their staff was super friendly to us even though we arrived pretty near closing time. Kudos!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyel9tNkJBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"Prompt service, servers are pretty attentive when we request to refill drinks. Food are good as usual."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdXVES0NREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"The restaurant have wide selections of sushi and set menu. My opinion is that the food here are nice & good! Their price should consider reasonable.

If can, I would recommend to go early or during off-perk hours as there are always a queue and their waiting time can be between 20-30.minites. No reservation allow.

I really recommend this to everyone not to miss it! 👍👍👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNWViOG1nRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,Food is okay. The service staff blocked out the entire row of seats near the window citing that is reserved for their staff only to open it up after 5 min when more customers came in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybTZYV0VnEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Bad experience and service, the two of us eating gave us a table for two but really small, we wanted to order a lot of food so asked for a bigger table as there wasn't enough space for our food, but they would rather let us seated at individual tables side by side instead of a table of 4 with lots of empty tables for 4 as we were not formally dressed nor Singaporean and couldn't seem to afford it. Many other 2 people who ordered less than us (only 1 set meal to share) got a table for 4 and ate comfortably. The food was so so, but Hotate Mentai Yaki disappointed me as the pictures and the food really didn't match. Really not worth eating, will never come again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaWZUT19nRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Food doesn't taste great like before.  Standard drop abit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWFiNUNREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Average menus at average pricing... Quality of prepping not as expected.. but then it was advertised as affordable Japanese cuisine nonetheless. 3 stars because of courteous and kind staffs. May not return though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbWZuRW53RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,Our regular Japanese restaurant in AMK HUB we love to visit that's near our home.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMW9hWTdRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"The presentation of the delivery is terrible. Come on, $18 for the sushi, can you all get a properly sized container? And no ginger?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMktEV0hREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Economical Japanese foods. Foods are well presented and value for money especially the value set meal. Just that the fried squids are over fried and oily. And not forgetting the staffs are friendly and nice at this outlet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNGZTMVpBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,Best for price Chicken Katsudon. Quality is consistent here. Been here many times over last 8 years. Tastes awesome. You wont be disappointed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc18zQU1nEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"If you don’t have the capacity to handle online orders, stop taking them. You are not only inconveniencing the customer but also the delivery person. Case in point, we ordered food at 5pm today (19 June) and the first scheduled delivery time was 5.30pm. Then it became 5.45, then 5.55 and 6.40pm. I am writing this is at 6.15pm. That is totally unacceptable and utterly irresponsible of Ichiban Boshi. The driver had to wait and potentially lose other deliveries because of your restaurant’s irresponsible behaviour. I will make it my personal mission to tell everyone about your ‘wonderful’ business."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcU5iTW5BRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"I have been coming here regularly as there’s no other Japanese options in Ang Mo Kio hub.  The QR code for ordering did not work thus a lady staff came over to assist with the order taking on the ipad. When she ran into some issues entering the orders, the managers (in black uniform) did not step in to assist to take the order.  It wasn’t a busy time. They left the lady staff struggling. I appreciate the helpfulness of this lady staff (Judy)..  The manager could  have given us another QR code to scan when i first alerted them that there was an error with the QR . None of the managers  stepped in to help understand or resolve the issue. There was also no apologies from any of the managers. Another slip of QR was then quietly placed on the table by another staff after the food arrived. There used to be a manager in specs who usually provide good service but he wasn’t around that day.  Judy was nice enough to come over to check if we got our food promptly. Kudos to her for her attentiveness. The same can’t be said of the managers.  I don’t know the role of the managers in this outlet - clearly they did not demonstrate service orientedness or proactiveness when I visited."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3NEWXdBRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"At this point, it is unfortunate that Ichiban is synonymous for awful service.

We have spoken to the manager after our meal and they were very understanding but this was what happened:

Walking to my seat, a guy pushing a trolly (with trash and a bin if i may highlight) came out from the kitchen and blocked the path so i went back and stood at the side so he could pass. I watched as he rudely used his hand to gesture to someone to move out of his way.

After speaking to the manager, it seems like that guy was the dishwasher and he was rude to the staffs too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXQtN053EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"Economic version of 🍣, just like our economic rice. Don't expect quality, but wide range in menu, great for quick fix and chill out. Could get crowded during peak hours as the seats are pretty limited and confined."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDclk2YVZ3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Decent spread of Japanese food. Sashimi is fresh. Personally felt the sushi rice was a tad too bland. Service is good in general. Won't mind visiting again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeVpXTGRBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"everything was fine, but just this male waiter in black shirt , simply just walk away ,after serving my food.
without listening to my new request order due to unable to order through the apps."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3al96Z2t3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,Went to have the meal slight earlier than normal meal time can avoid the crowd or Long queue wait. The staff was attentive to customer and friendly during their service. Food are fresh and delicious. Serving if the food was fast to the order. Green tea was on refillable and they taste nicely.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaF9PMDNRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Super noisy.  Was there alone at about 3pm.  Theres this 2 chefs at the sashimi counter, a small build chinese malaysian and a vietnamese lady I suppose whom were busy chit-chatting all the way since I step in for my meal till I left, and still chatting!  Worst is I can even hear their conversation from the very far corner of the restaurant by the window.   Food is good I must say.  But ambience is a big minus!  Ordered a kimchi pot, a sashimi platter, a chirashi set and a soda.

Will go back again, but will peek first to see whether those 2 chaps are working together or not!  Lol....."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN1pYVW1RRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Assistant manager by the name of Mark was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude.
When asked how long the waiting time would be, he responded with an awful tone. Even rolled his eyes at us as he was walking away."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb3VfSFRBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),1,"Green tea was not hot enough, sushi rice is overcooked and marshy, chawamushi with roe the roe is not fresh, gyoza tasted doubled fried and sitting in a place of sweet sauce. There are also fruit flies around. Never will visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNamVTVmt3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"A budget Japanese restaurant which gives good value for money. This is a busy outlet with queue number system so be prepared for a long wait on peak hours.

Another successful chain by the RE&S group."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNHBTOGl3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,Ichiban Sushi is one of my fav sushi place.Aaahh their salmon mental sushi is one of their new dish and its just so delicious and pleasurable. Beautiful ambiance and the prices are affordable. You can eat everything here and they provide big meals☺️Truly perfect for me and my friend❤️Definitely will recommend it and see you again❤️
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLakp5TDZ3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"First time at Ichiban, was looking for light foods, friendly staffs,reasonable price, facing to Ave 3  along with Angsana big tree."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNU9LQmpnRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"Dusty and dirty.. even the food is nice and service is good, but the hygiene at the counter table is just awful, how come no one take care of these basic hygiene ?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeWNhWUVnEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,Food and services good. Especially their fried Salmon fish head soup which always finish very fast. Hope they can have more on the menu for the day cos usually it's sold out by lunch
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3ck9TV21nRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"The foods are good. Been here plenty of times, and they managed to maintain the quality. But be prepared for long waiting (queue) time, especially on weekends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhbC1lRVNBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,Nice Tendonburi. Always feel good to dine in. Look forward to another meal here.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ0tMVTNBRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,"Been coming here for a while, but in the past month, the food has been way tooooo salty. Suspect chef has long covid anosmia.

The saltiness is obnoxious, such that when u drink the miso soup, it is tasteless because everything is sooooo salty.

Please do something"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURva0tpT0hREAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),4,"The newly renovated space looks better, and seems to fill more crowd too with seemingly more chef's counters. Food wise, as expected. However, the unagi don I ordered doesn't seem to have as much ingredients as I expected, and was an off balance to the amount of rice that was given. Not sure about other outlets though.

But I gotta praise the service staff for being attentive! I called once for my green tea to be refilled and it was seen to automatically after, which I really appreciate. Thank you!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX01QcGxRRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),3,"Just had dinner here . Nothing special about this restaurant. Food is normal
There are ala carte and set for you to choose with other side dishes. Plenty to choose
Prices depend on what type of food you choose.
Happy eating happy life !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4N2JiVGl3RRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"The food is absolutely delicious and served by friendly staffs too! Will definitely come again! 😊👍🏻

The picture below is named Half Curry Udon for $6.90, and I loved it!  😊"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaHMtN1RBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,Sushi was passable at best. Fairprice sushi is better honestly.. Soba and tempura wasn't fantastic either. Definitely NOT worth the premium
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OEx5YWV3EAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),2,I wasn't expecting the food quality to be so poor given their other branches are good. The service is good but the food quality itself (down to ingredients) is well below expectation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc3ZpdzZnRRAB,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"All time favourite. Located at the 2nd level of AMK hub.

Fast and good service.

Love the food but it lacked pork katsu.

Service staff are friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdUpudVFBEAE,Ichiban Sushi (Ang Mo Kio),5,"As a regular customer of Ichiban Sushi, I tried many different combinations, no matter sushi, tampura, udon, ramen, sashimi, or the beef, pork, chicken, Ichiban Sushi never disappointed me.
The Garlic Chicken Wazen is very popular, and YES! you can't miss it.
Salmon Belly Mentai Yaki is also recommended, I ordered it almost every time!
Some dessert like a Motcha ice cream is a perfect treat after the meal.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd0xLTTdRRRAB,ToriYard,4,"I love how the outdoor seating makes you feel that you are enclosed with the greenery and you do not feel like u are in a park.

food was average but we like how the staff listened to the feedback we gave to Cook the chicken liver a little less done. and they managed to perfect it !

special shout out to the staff Sam (sum) whom managed to salvage a situation we encountered while dining. he also has good knowledge in the sake there and was able to recommend to us.

would definitely visit them again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtamJ1NXZ3RRAB,ToriYard,4,"Cozy place for gathering with friends and family.

Surprisingly the skewers tasted quite good, although the price is slightly expensive than those Japanese food you can found in town like orchard area.

Best to go if you’re looking for job-crowded place for lunch. Definitely can give a try if you’re looking for beers and wine at night. 🌸🌸"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPd1BudGxRRRAB,ToriYard,4,Came here in the afternoon and had the set lunch. The pork and ginger is recommended. It comes with a soft boiled egg which when poured over the rice really makes the dish quite nice. Prices are on the high end. It is set in a park and there is ample parking nearby.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX1pmWGxRRRAB,ToriYard,4,"The dinning environment is unbeatable. Surrounded by greenery. We were greeted by the guy restaurant manager during lunch and he was very friendly always served with a smile. Typical Japanese set lunch that you can find elsewhere, I feel their food is rather average but all their service and environment save one star. And Their complementary dessert is nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtemEzME1REAE,ToriYard,4,"First of all, amazing alfresco setting. My partner and I went during weekend lunch and fortunately it wasn’t that crowded. Able to enjoy the peace and nature in a well-ventilated place. I like how the restaurant is well maintain and there’s a small washing area with soap and sanitizer for those who were in the outdoor seats area.

I only see 2 service staff during our visit. Not sure if the restaurant is understaffed because you need some patience to get their attention at times. Otherwise no complain about the service.

Food wise, the price is definitely on the much higher side and we were glad that the food quality and taste justify the price paid - except the dessert. Simple cake, ice cream and sweet red bean cost $15++ which I thought it’s way too overpriced. 2 simple appetizers, 2 assorted plates and a dessert set us off slightly above $100.

Overall it was a satisfying meal. Maybe will come back again for the ambience and to try the sake and beer."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODlLdlFnEAE,ToriYard,3,Great ambience and cosy. The restaurant wasn’t too noisy and ideal for family and couple. Food was alright and a bit pricey. No drinks was served and we have to pay for chilli🤪. Service staffs are friendly esp the guy in white and the humorous lady with black rim specs. Overall my family enjoyed ourselves and the beautiful surrounding.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM3JTaDBBRRAB,ToriYard,5,"Great ambience and impeccable service. Food is above average but not the type that makes you feel like you must come back again, especially because it is slightly pricey. Really enjoyed the wagyu don - the wagyu was super tender and the rice was well flavoured. Skewers and sushi weren't anything to shout about tbh. Loved the tartness of the cheesecake."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybXVpdk9REAE,ToriYard,4,"Brought my mum to celebrate Mother’s Day at Tori Yard. While the food is on the pricier side, as per all Japanese restaurant, the quality of food is worth the price. The cold soba was surprisingly good (my guess it’s handmade due to uneven strands of noodle). The sashimi is fresh and thick cut too. The waiter forgot our sushi order, so we waited quite a while. We were pleasantly surprised when he served us free cups of tea for keeping us waiting. Unfortunately the sushi was abit underwhelming. While it tasted not bad but we preferred the traditional kind as compared to this new creation that has a crisp batter. Overall, it’s a nice place to catch up with delicious food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcU5IckpBEAE,ToriYard,5,"Had a family dinner here to celebrate the start of Q3 and Q4. Ordered sashimis, agemono, sushi (salmon and tuna) based on the wait staff's recommendations. Food were fresh, really delish and service is good. Ambient is also very apt for a nice chill family time. What stood out? The yellowtail collar, stingray fin, house sushi, wagyu don, and kurobota pork. Really had a great time. Feel relaxed and ready for the work week again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHBiUi13RRAB,ToriYard,4,"Have a great time with friends here... Tempura not bad, could be better. Enjoy the desserts, delightful ending after a heavy meal, must try the special dessert! Server are friendly but might be a little bit understaffs as we needed to wave a few times before they can attend to us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXek5mRTBBRRAB,ToriYard,5,"The food here is really good! We came here on a Saturday for lunch and the ambience at the park was nice. Their service staff are also attentive and easy to get their attention. Would recommend their wagyu beef don ($30+) and chawanmushi. Nice place to spend a bit more money and chill vibes.

Near the carpark too so it's easy to get to.

Would come again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaElqV0VREAE,ToriYard,3,Had a bite here after a hike. It's beautifully nestled inside the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park so there's greenery all around. The entrance is very insta-worthy & the night view imo is nicer. Service was prompt & we got seated and ordered their ToriYard signature maki. We waited a good 20mins+ for it to be ready and it wasn't served cold. The rice was room-temperature & so were the ingredients. Pretty disappointing after a long wait. I would still give them another chance as we went on a public holiday & they were probably overwhelmed. Wanna try their Yakitori - it was serving up plate after plate at good speed unlike our maki 😢
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM0l5c1F3EAE,ToriYard,4,"Good range, food quality , ambience were ok. But nothing is really memorable and making me want to come back again. Think it’s a little overpriced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTlmUFBnEAE,ToriYard,4,"Love the embience in Bishan park. Enjoy the big cooling air even in outdoor sitting. Service is good. Food is tasty. Nice place for beer, sake, in the late afternoon."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGUzV1ZBEAE,ToriYard,4,"Delectable donburi and yakitori coupled with relaxing environment with alfresco & indoor dining. If not for its overpriced draft beers, this restaurant is definitely worth the praise."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcjVic1JREAE,ToriYard,4,"One of the best salmon sashimi I've had in Singapore! The slices were thick and fatty, and sushi quality was excellent. The salmon made us happy campers. We both had the sets, I had the saba fish set. It was well cooked and tender, and was de-boned as well so was very easy to eat.

Only thing is I didn't enjoy the soft boiled egg that the set came with as I felt it didn't compliment the dish. I poured half on my rice but preferred it without.

Sets are also very pricey.

The staff and service were great and very attentive, even though we were seated outside, we had no trouble calling the staff who seemed to be able to predict when we would need them."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ2ZqRHVBRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Beautiful yard seatings. Plants and even we spotted a carpenter bee around the flowers!
Don are just okay - may not be their specialty - still the price is at the high end.
Come early or very late is the key to enjoy the outdoor seatings. Before 7pm people are rushing in and the breaking of quietness breaks the beauty of the serene environment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOXMydmZREAE,ToriYard,5,Price is a little on the high side but it is reasonable for the superb quality of the food. Wide array of choices from Yakitori to ala-carte dishes as well as a few choices of Don. 😁 sashimi is quite fresh too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMjhYMktnEAE,ToriYard,5,"One of the best Japanese restaurants we’ve dined at in Singapore. Great service and good food. We liked almost everything we ordered especially the yakitori, king oyster, scallops sashimi."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMmZIUk1nEAE,ToriYard,5,"Food was really good, but the price is on the more expensive side. Spent about $170 (with taxes) for a 9 piece skewer set, Gindara Misoyaki, Ten Soba, 3 Rice set, 4 piece skewer on the side and 3 genmaicha. The Gindara (cod fish) was pleasantly sweet and the skewers especially the chicken momo was have a nice charcoal taste. The pork belly skewer was a little tough though. Some food with sauce is slightly on the stronger/saltier side (which i enjoy) so do a small sample before gobbling.
Service was generally good.
Note that some items can only be served outdoors such as the grillset.  Both indoors and outdoors seating were comfortable at night.
Not crowded when I visited but it was late (845pm). You can book before visiting and ask for either indoor or outdoor seating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNU11V1N3EAE,ToriYard,3,"Japanese restaurant serving yummy simple food, located in scenic Ang mo kio- bishan park.  Lovely alfresco area & great for a stop before or after a walk in the park.

We had light bites which was the skewers & they were great
Chicken tsukune with onsen egg gives a refreshing take on the item as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aU11UGd3RRAB,ToriYard,3,"All park restaurants have that added charm which is usually offsetted by the premium price.

Toriyard is no exception. Food wise, quality was average, pricing slightly higher which was not unexpected. Service was quite good, pleasant wait staff, common man type rather than those posh places.. attentive and smiley.

Worst thing about the place is the menu. First off, menu was only online and connection was extremely slow. Page took a min each to load. And.... It had no pictures.

So skewer chicken had a difference with grilled chicken... Although, because there wasn't any pictures... I couldn't tell what the differences were. And because there were no pictures, I didn't know what the plating was.

Buckwheat noodles in soup... Could really look very appealing, or go the totally opposite direction and be a huge letdown.

Anyway, all in all, 3/5."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaS1ISklREAE,ToriYard,4,"Ok to have simple meal. The service is ok. But not happy with the waiter Sam.. we arrived early and made reservation but arranged bad seats while others got better view one without reservation.
The food is ok but the eel is not ok, so suggest to go for the rest if possible."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNjk2eWh3RRAB,ToriYard,4,"Flavorful Japanese Cuisine in the park, with flora and fauna surrounding the whole eatery. A must try when you finish your activities nearby at the park!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX3RLUXFnRRAB,ToriYard,4,Not crowded but crowds starts to build after 7pm. Food taste are okay but the price is steep for out of town area.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLU5meE1REAE,ToriYard,4,Food is really good! But price is quite steep! Nice  Veranda setup.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdjk3S29RRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Food is great. Value for the money. The main course Saba Shioyaki Teishoku came as a set with soup side dish, rice and dessert.  I came for late lunch and was their last order. But they did not rush to cook,  the food was done well and it was delicious. One comment l wish to make was l ordered a cold Genmai cha, and l request to refill with hot cha, the waiter said it will be charged. I was  puzzled because its just fill my cup with hot tea and not cold. But anyway l know its a policy.

Besides that the atmosphere is great and cosy.

I came here today because 5 years ago l brought my late mom here to enjoy tea in a garden. She passed away 5 years ago. This place brings back good memory of my mom.

Thank you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd01HcEVREAE,ToriYard,5,"We got outdoor seat for dinner, chill and greenery environment. Great food and service, recommend for family or friends casual dining."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOXIyYnRBRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Food: Shiitake was big, juicy, chewy, not too salty, and most important it had this smoked taste that makes you feel like you're at a barbecue without suffering the heat and smoke in your hair.
Chicken thigh was smooth, juicy, slightly crunchy skin, and no charring.
Quail eggs with pork belly wasn't anything amazing though the combination was new to me and much appreciated. It might have had more impact if the pork belly was more flavorful.

Ambience: BEAUTIFUL. Excluding the one guest who spoke way too loud at times, the place was generally pretty chill. A nice place to spend a night in the park enjoying some delicious food.

Staff: Attentive, friendly, and most importantly, chill. No issues getting someone to take our orders. Refillable drinks are refilled very timely. Just very nice people in general.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was because the online menu was a disappointment.
For a restaurant with such enjoyable delicacies, the new menu decided to go with the standard izakaya style of having NO PICTURES.
Your food is great, and your menu is digital, so why not take a few photos (or grab some of the amazing ones here) and put that on your DIGITAL menu?
Maybe not for the drinks but definitely the food and the desserts. You have nothing to be ashamed about your food, so build a little anticipation and excitement for us by putting some nice photos of the food in your menu! I feel it's especially important for first-timers to this wonderful restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejZIaExnEAE,ToriYard,5,"Came at 8.30pm with seats available. Good ambience, great staff and super good food. Sushi was one of the best I've had in Singapore, expensive but very worth it. Black pork is super flavourful as well. Will definitely come again, highly recommended! Opens till late (around midnight) so great for drinks and hanging out with friends."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ak9IWDBRRRAB,ToriYard,1,"It was my first visit.
Service can be improved. It was hard to get the attention of a staff to take our orders as serving staffs do not take orders.
Everything went well until my Tsukune came uncooked in the center. I felt disgusted because I already took a big bite.
They did replace my tsukune but I don’t think I’ll visit again. Their service recovery weren’t the best."

Service can be improved because it took some time to take order. Food was pretty good! I like the skewers, toriyard sushi and fried squid. They have an extensive list of sake. Great sake menu and I love their cups. Overall will visit again! :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLVlLWVhBEAE,ToriYard,5,Today we had a impromptu lunch at Toriyard. Supposed to be 8 of us however some didn't manage to join us. The chef is very courteous during introduction of the menu. We especially like the lady server who sent us our food!! Heard that it was her 1st day there..Keep up the good work!!👍🏻Will definitely be back😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNF92QUt3EAE,ToriYard,2,"Ambience was beautiful, but service time was extremely slow. Cooked food served should be warm but some were not. Our food was uncooked and the restaurant waived off the price for that dish. Not a very good experience as one would have greater expectations given the price point."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OC1qR2hnRRAB,ToriYard,5,Nice ambience. Food is good. Beer is strong. Staff and service is engaging and friendly. Ive nothing to drop a star. Will come back and totally recommend. 👍 picture dont do justice. All is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2N3UzUW9RRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Extremely good service! The food selection is quite huge as well, their donburis are really good and the portions are reasonably big, as well as their skewers, highly recommended to try them.

The prices are a bit on the expensive side, but that's the standard of such restaurants, I think it's worth a try if you're willing to spend a bit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbTZyNS1nRRAB,ToriYard,5,"We are surprised to receive 1 slice of birthday cake as Jack heard that we have birthday girl when he served us ice cream.

Salmon sashimi is fresh, chicken curry don has large portion and sesame ice cream not so sweet.

Good service  and attentive to customer needs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNakt6ejNRRRAB,ToriYard,4,"Not open in the morning. But they seems like selling more and promoting beer. Perhaps a heaven for beer drinker in this neighbourhood. There are many trace of Japanese decor, with huge lanterns and many seemingly art object that represent Japanese culture spew around the premise. The garden is well kept to look so natural and I love the entrance to the small tavern. Yes tavern. Hidden away in the garden on a small mold. The rising step tells me that I am ascending to some higher plane. Drinking. LOL

We came here again yesterday. Love the food and the environment. Will come more often."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdVpuaDlnRRAB,ToriYard,1,"The Mentaiko Hotate had an extremely dodgy taste. By chance the Mentaiko fell off the scallop and I tasted the scallop on its own, it wasn’t fresh and had a questionable taste to it. 🤮

The sushi is pricey at $5 a piece.

The only saving grace is the Skewers.

Really did not feel that this was value for money.

The Hotate and Squid was an absolute rip off. I really wished I hadn’t come here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMUxLZWRREAE,ToriYard,1,"Such a pity. Food was good but overall experience was ruined by the staff in a white uniform, which I understand was the assistant manager. Very unwelcoming and hostile as a service staff. What was supposed to be a happy and positive experience was turned sour the moment we entered, no thanks to the Asst manager. Pls consider retraining this staff if he is going to be the first point of contact for all patrons."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyajZpQ3d3RRAB,ToriYard,4,"Situated inside Bishan Park, nice place for a good Japanese meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX2YtM2V3EAE,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,2,"Located in B2 of AMK Hub where Fairprice is, just beside the Dessert shop.
Bought voucher from ShopBack. Service was ok and prompt, waiting time was okay.
But food is subpar. Ordered curry chicken katsu and gyu don.
Look at the gyu don rice that looks like mui fan or porridge. Totally wet from the sauce which is not to my preference. Note: I didn't mix the rice btw. I'm not sure if donburis are supposed to be this wet. Beef was average, not too chewy. Red ginger not sweet enough.
Not sure if it's just an outlet problem, but I might reconsider getting mains from here next time. Sushi for quick fixes are still average and sufficient."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXazZPcW9BRRAB,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,1,"Visited the AMK hub branch on 5th March, 1:27pm bought the maki mix set that costs $8.20. Despite their sushi looking less appealing compared to other takeout sushi competitors around in the mall like Mr Sushi@ NTUC and Kuriya’s, I still decided to give them the benefit of doubt and went ahead with my purchase. Upon consuming, I was appalled by the sourness of the chuka maki. I then sniffed and taste tested the rest of the set and realised they have all gone bad too. Sadly, the only ones that were still edible were the mini cucumber, tamogo + crab stick ones. The sushi rice were tad disappointing too, lacking in the vinegary touch that usual sushi should have. Service wise was fine but food quality could have been better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNUlILVpBEAE,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,2,Grateful to Cecelia but left because of peer pressure.  The kitchen is very unsafe both because the management does no business in improving safety and pricing of items sold . I judge the whole entity as a failure..well in disguise and in perceiving that the big boss is too arrogant and too flamboyant to the shareholders and only thinks highly of the brand which is not even original in Taste.  Japanese people will tell you this whole set-up is corrupted to a certain extent and there is going to be a dispute soon from logistics down to distribution networks. In fact the NEA is going to task and remove the label from the kitchens of UMISUSHI. Appreciate your concerted effort in making the disorganisation review and help throw the disputed managers out to the public and private eateries for further questions.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkxiMThBRRAB,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,4,Decent yummy Japanese food which is reasonably priced! Kids loves the oyakodon and chanwamushi !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcXVicTNnRRAB,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,1,"Just bought the Umi birthday Don set from this outlet today at 7.25pm, it was so disappointing because my Onsen egg was broken, there was insufficient sauce for both rice and the chicken and worse of all, the 'fresh greens' were definitely not fresh! The broccoli in particular tasted sour, and it wasn't the vinegar kind of sour, but the sourness that comes from food gone bad. As I stayed nearby, I returned to the outlet at around 9pm with my bento, to feedback to the staff at the outlet about the sour broccoli. The staff replied me that the sourness was probably came from the wafuku sauce added. I explained to the staff that it was only the broccoli that tasted sour and no other part of the bento, which would not be the case if the sauce was added to the bento. The staff took my bento over and looked at it for a good 2 seconds and then asked if I wanted him to throw it away, with no other follow up action like checking if the existing stock of vegetables did go bad. This is my first time trying the bento and it was definitely not worth my time, or any others for the matter!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMTdMazFBRRAB,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,3,"A cheap fix for your sushi craving. The sushi does tend to get left on the shelf for Long hours depending on the sales volume of the day.

It looks appetising and is a decent enough fix. However, the food has tasted/looked off several times towards the shop closing hours.

I would suggest adding different flavours of sushi to entice more customers to buy.

But I will return as their food is 3 stars worth of tastiness!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcHQtRzZ3RRAB,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,1,"The worst decision I made today is to have lunch at Umi sushi Mount Alvernia.

Order a ramen and found a piece of plastic roughly 5cm long and 2mm wide inside the soup. Brought the item to counter and the staff gave me a “new bowl”, old noodle with new soup, probably boiled together as the previous one with the plastic in.

I am a breastfeeding mother and I am really worried that I may have ingested plastic (thus causing harm to the baby thru my produce) becos the plastic surely doesn’t look like a complete piece! Decided to stop breastfeeding my baby from now on, thanks to the excellence  service of Umi Sushi.

I noticed on Google review, that just two months ago another reviewer has encountered the same “plastic incident “ at Mount Alvernia outlet! Well done management!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaVppOFd3EAE,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,1,"We ordered the poke bowl and paid about 15 dollars but it was outright inedible. The fish was tasteless and the rice was regular white rice. The rest of the toppings were okay because they were just shredded vegetables. The one star is for the staff, and the best part of the meal was leaving."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeW82TFBnEAE,umisushi Ang Mo Kio Hub,1,Was at their Mt Alvernia branch for lunch today. Ordered their Tori Teriyaki Bento. The meat was uncooked and still red. They took it back to recook the meat and placed it back to onto the bento. Half way thru eating found a piece of plastic inside. It looks like a handplaster but they claimed it is just a plastic wrap for their seaweed that they accidentally dropped into the bento!! What a lousy restuarant with poor hygeine standard. Will never go back!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4ODQyRWdRRRAB,Sumo Japanese Food,5,"I’m surprised that there’s just 1 review done for this food business. Since COVID-19 CB, my family have ordered several times (if not weekly) for their tasty and affordable meal delivery. We were initially attracted to the fair pricing (think $5 for a Chicken Chop with delicious Brown Sauce, and 2 well portioned sides well packed in divider tray). Then there’s no turning back... we start trying all kinds of Japanese & Western food selection, and almost all satisfied. And for the 1 Sushi Tray which we commented that the rice texture is too hard from excessive pressure, this flaw is corrected immediately on next order. Very impressive business owner, who take feedback seriously. This is also the reason why I felt compelled to leave this positive review. They deserve to do better and survive current difficult wave. By saying that, I’m also helping those who order food deliveries on frequent basis. Their pricing is Very Affordable!! Especially if you live around their stall @ Koufu NYP. I reside in Sengkang and enjoys special discounted delivery fee at just $3 when I order in for my family of 4. Imagine $5 x 4 meals, add $3 for transport and that is just $23 nett for a good dinner delivered to doorstep.

Finally, I would like to recommend our family’s favourites: Chicken Chop with Brown Sauce ($5), Hawaiian Chicken Chop ($6), Mexican Chicken Chop ($6), Mashed Potato that are served with the mains, Oyako-don ($5) and the 8-piece Sushi Tray ($7)."

Ordered the saba shio fish, Koebi (fried small prawns) kake udon, and okonomiyaki. All were delicious and very much like having a meal back in Japan! Portions were bigger than expected, but value for money!
Had hot barley tea, came in a big pot, bf got iced one, free refills! Must come and try, won't be disappointing!

Overall, a homely little place I wouldn't mind retuning to again if I'm in the vicinity. Otherwise, it's located at a pretty inaccessible place - best to drive there."

The potato salad is good but relatively expensive at $5.80 before service charge.

Food is ordered via scanning a QR code."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxa2RLcW93RRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Tamako Meal has always been in our must visit list of Japanese Restaurants in Singapore. Their meals are simple yet authentic, never compromise in food quality and always ensure us with sufficient portion. Never miss their Giant Squid and Tuna bowl for our every visits. Owner is always friendly and chats with diners occasionally. Awesome place. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdkpTSmN3EAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Great value Japanese food. I always felt the bento set was one of the most value Japanese meals in Singapore.

I added on the squid from Hokkaido based on their recommendation and it was great too.

The place is always kept clean and tired so it is great especially for a season of covid19."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHNHU2VREAE,Tamako Meal,3,"Had the katsu Don, katsu curry rice and salmon roll. Decent meal for the price paid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2M3NPd0VREAE,Tamako Meal,1,"This is a really bad sushi to be honest .  Cheap ingrediants and selling it over price except for the ebiko the rest are cheap ingrediants like egg,cucumbe, crab meat . The sushi rice is quite sweet . Salmon is cut as thin as a panty liner . Whats worst … Soy sauce is not japanese soy sauce .. its some breakfast egg soy sauce/cooking soy sauce … Would highly not recommend …"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMWFTbEZBEAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Alright! It's well deserving of their ratings... Staff are friendly and helpful. I would recommend anyone to come and try their dory fillets and bentos anytime.

The location is in a accessible location with nearby parking. so whether you are coming via public transportation or private vehicles you can always get a slot at your convenience.

Enjoy their hearty meals and story of Tamako!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MDZlRnR3RRAB,Tamako Meal,4,"Dropped by for dinner without reservation on Saturday night. Had to wait a bit for seats. Ordered Tamako Teishoku (beef yakiniku) using phone via a QR receipt they provided. Food took quite awhile to come but understandable as the restaurant was packed and there was takeaway orders too. Teishoku set is value for money as it comes with rice, miso soup, ebi fry (prawn tempura), nikujaga (potato with meat), deep fried dumpling, chicken karage (fried chicken) and beef yakiniku. Every item is hot and freshly made. Beef yakiniku is on the salty side but rice complement well with it. Overall had an enjoyable meal!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ajdfa29nRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,An old-timer cosy Japanese restaurant that have existed as far as my memories could take me. The daily set meals are good value-for-money and worth checking out.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN2JpZWVnEAE,Tamako Meal,2,"Feels like a food court eatery. There was a musky smell indoors, and there was only one wait staff (who seemed tired even though the shop just opened) on a Sunday lunch. Expected good food due to the many good reviews, but alas somehow my family didn't like the food we ordered. Even the basic udon broth has not much flavour and is just a salty broth. Sorry we won't be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHVYOTRnRRAB,Tamako Meal,4,"Small eatery offering delicious, home-cooked styled Japanese meals and dishes. Prices are reasonable. Just that waiting time can be a bit long during meal times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMXRhdlp3EAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Excellent no-fuss affordable Japanese food in a homely setting. I love the dashi stock being used and the miso soup was not overly salty, yet very flavourful.

Lower Pierce reservoir is round the corner; very scenic, plenty of monkeys and good for a stroll albeit very humid.

It was full house when I was there. Will visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNm9tSFRREAE,Tamako Meal,2,My family has been coming to this restaurant for more than 10 years. This evening was the first time we had a very disappointing dinner. Quality of food has dropped a lot. Even hot tea wasn't hot. May not go back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cUtIMVF3EAE,Tamako Meal,2,"Waited for some time before food was served though there were only about 3 tables. We waited about 25 minutes for our food.  Staff was not attentive to customer's needs. Was busier on phone . Food was not up to expectation.  V disappointing with the food standard.  I used to patronise their shop fee years back regularly.  After pandemic,  food quality dropped tremendously."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X0pMclJREAE,Tamako Meal,1,It was not a pleasant experience.  The sushi was soggy. The rice had the texture of porridge.  It tasted like the sushi was frozen and then defrosted in the microwave.  The staff was unpleasant and did not seem to care very much. One of the male staff who looks like the owner/manager walked in and out of the kitchen without a mask.  We will not come back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2NIdXpBRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Today's tempura Don was excellent. Perfectly done. However the miso soup was bland, couldn't taste the miso at all!. Dish cannot order take away, as it will be soggy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdl9PZ0xREAE,Tamako Meal,4,"Was around the corner so came to try out this place based on the good reviews on Google. Like most reviewers mentioned, this restaurant really does give a homely vibe. Ordered a bento set (recommended by staff) and a katsu curry don. Bento set of  $15.80 is really value for money as there was 8 dishes in a bento box. Curry was really good but katsu was too tough. Almost 5 stars, but we waited 20-30mins for 2 packets of takeaway so minus 1 star."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTNE9Yb2pnRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,A nice and homey little restaurant. Food here is delicious but sadly some or the item on the menu is perpetually unavailable. Will be back again if we are in the neighborhood
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycWNhb21nRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Nice cosy place for a peaceful weekday lunch. My first time here, further down from the famous prata shop. A very low key shop front. I nearly missed it. I went on a Wednesday afternoon. Parked at the public carpark nearby.  The place is cosy and comfortable. Nothing fancy, very homely ambience. Ordered the Wednesday special bento set. Portion is big. Comes with a big pot of tea. The sashimi is very fresh. I love the miso soup. Rice is sushi rice. Overall, I like this place , good food, reasonable price. Will bring my family for dinner some day"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNGVHX3VnRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Don't expect restaurant fare, in fact, Tamako's greatest selling point is the very heart-warming, homely meal you can't help but get addicted to.

Cozy place but still spacious: Portions are quite generous and doesn't really break the bank. 9/10 for me with the missing point easily gained if you request for the sides to be served separately.

Will be back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNFBqNW9BRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Casual dinner with a couple of friends.
Had the teppanyaki beef set (changed rice to garlic fried rice), chicken chahan, mentaiko okonomiyaki, koebi and a few more dishes like salmon sashimi and sushi. Happy that we're able to order from sister restaurant Tamako Meal!

Price very reasonable, friendly staff, 10/10 will come again 👏🏻

P.s. parking might be hard over the weekends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTenN5WU13EAE,Tamako Meal,2,"Again I got tricked by google reviews. 4.3 stars erm no! We came with full excitement after reading the reviews plus hungry stomachs we were looking forward for this meal, we came on dec 25 evening, the woman cashier is clearly unfriendly. Quite grumpy and irritated, heard her screamed loudly at kitchen for every order and checking if food is done, it's really not a good feeling having someone screaming/yelling near you while having your food from beginning till the end. Plus when i asked her a question about the food in the menu, she seemed to be unhappy.

I got a mother and child don, chicken isn’t fresh and has a strong chicken smell. And a unagi don isn’t good as well a strong smell of soil. Bloated after eating their food.

The food in don donki at harbour front tasted a ton better, I seriously doubt the reviews here, is this 5 star food?"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNVp1UlZREAE,Tamako Meal,4,"Home-cooked Japanese food that’s easy on the wallet!

Paired udon with karaage and katsu curry.. ooh yummy. Simple meal but satisfying!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3clBiNzJRRRAB,Tamako Meal,3,"Your friendly neighbourhood Japanese eatery that's oozing with simplicity and charm. Don't expect any fancy games, it's just pure straight home cooked style Japanese food that's decent and economical. 98% of the dishes in the menu are below $20. Can't get better value that that surely, especially when this is not one of your usual hawker stall.
Again, the food's quality is decent and service is good too. Believe it or not , the chef cooking your Japanese meal is actually an Indian chap (see pict). How diverse and inclusive is that! 😁😋 3.5 stars."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMU8ySnN3RRAB,Tamako Meal,4,"Been around for as long as I remembered. For when you just want a quick fuss free home styled prepared 'Japanese' meal. Not cheap, but still nonetheless pretty reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaDRqd0FnEAE,Tamako Meal,4,Nice cosy Japanese style family restaurant.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjLTdPU3R3RRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Our family go to place. Great A5 wagyu steak and the fried rice, on top of our usual order of kawa. Next time , I would like to try A5 wagyu shabu shabu or sukiyaki with our usual with the sake..Look forward to this....."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c3ZfTHd3RRAB,Tamako Meal,4,Homely and affordable. Reached at about 1+ close to 2pm and they still allowed us to order even though they close at 2.30pm. Can change udon to buckwheat noodles. Also called Sanpachiro
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkxIb253RRAB,Tamako Meal,4,Great service staff and the food is affordable and tasty. I come here often for my meal. It could be quite pack during the weekend. I order the daily set meal which I find it very tasty. The unagi fish very done perfectly. The prawn roll was nicely done too. The potato salad was crisp in taste. The mini octupus was not quite good though. It comes in big size which does not match the tiny name given. Overall I still love this restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cDUzeUdnEAE,Tamako Meal,4,"Tamako is run the way a warm-hearted Japanese mom would: with simple, authentic dishes. Really enjoyed the Hokkaido grilled squid and unagi sushi."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbG9tRUR3EAE,Tamako Meal,4,"I doubt the authenticity of this Japanese place but this have not stopped me from coming here over the past 10 years. I like the simplicity of their food and warm vibe of the place itself. My absolute favourite is their Zaru soba which is seemingly simple but deceivingly delicious. Go for their kani mayo sushi too with 2 big generous servings of crabmeat mayo at just a few dollars.
I never leave this place feeling dissatisfied."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMzlxcmNBEAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Great service, sushi is fresh. Menu options are good. My frequent haunt."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaXJmaGxRRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Been passing by this restaurant for many times but never stepped into it.
Today's my 1st and definitely will not be my last.
Authentic tasty homely Japanese food. Ordered a salmon bento + grilled squid + udon.
The food isn't salty. We love the grilled squid. It is soooooo good. Highly recommended dish.
The portion of bento and udon is satisfying."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOTkzTVlREAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Location: Nestled between some high profile eateries, so you won't miss it. You may find it hard to find parking space during peak hrs, so come early to avoid the stress.

Menu: A decent variety of japanese food, whipped up by a legitimate Japanese chef. You can read abt the history of the shop on the menu itself. Have attached some images for reference.

Waiting Time: Approximately 15 to 20 mins during peak hrs.

Quality of Food: Homemade, heartwarming Japanese food. Decent considering the price factor! Delicious.

Overall: Value for money Jap food that is worth coming for."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OFk2SWtRRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"it would be an understatement to say this place is the best place for authentic, cheap and absolutely, mind blowing Japanese food. the staff here are world class and the decor feels comfortable yet not overwhelmingly upscale. the place is kept spotless and well mantained. the restaurant itself is joined with another right beside it essentially doubling the menu and giving you the option of grilled yakitori or udon, ramen soba and Don and much much more signature drinks and side dishes. would give 6 stars if I could. 11/10"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaWN2THFRRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,"Unpretentious and good Japanese food located in a quaint estate along Upper Thomson road.

I've exclusively ordered the katsu-don here many times and have always been satisfied by it. The flavor reminds me of what I used to have about 10 years ago as a kid which I distinctly remember the taste of but could never find it again until here (cue the ratatouille flashback scene). The tender tonkatsu soaked through with delicious dashi stock and the egg cooked just to the right doneness to coat every mouthful of rice with egg and dashi sauce.

What you'll expect here is homely, good food with no fuss at a reasonable price tag. I cannot recommend it enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3M0xXd1ZnEAE,Tamako Meal,5,"If you’re looking for a simple, honest Japanese style cuisine, and you’re nearby, Tamako is a no brainer.

You get this feeling that families frequent this place, which says a lot about the affordability and accessibility of the food. We ordered a don, and various side dishes; I recommend the home made potato salad and the croquette.

The oyako don we had was sumptuous and filling; the egg was both runny and had texture at the same time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrM29uaEdREAE,Tamako Meal,5,Old school Japanese home cook feel. I've been having their curry rice for the past 20 odd years. Their grilled salmon taste great too..!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwc2R5eFV3EAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Splendid,the experience I had in this store is perfect.The service is commendable,the food was good,pricing was affordable,and the people there were very proactive,Everytime I finished my drink,they would immediately refill it regardless of iced or hot.In a nutshell,I am extremely satisfied with this store and will definitely come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydkp5MUp3EAE,Tamako Meal,5,"Homely food, friendly owner, great prices! Love their very reasonably priced teishoku sets which allows me to savour so many things at once - on top of the main item of your choice, you also get nikujaga (my comfort food!), potato salad, ebi fry, gyoza, chicken karaage, edamame. Only downside is limited parking spaces nearby during peak periods."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaVlydXJ3RRAB,Tamako Meal,1,"Made reservation. Double confirmed my reservation when asked again.
Arrived at tamako and was informed that ""we are full"". When asked for waiting time, ""must wait for tables"". So, what's the point for double confirmation of this reservation with no tables??
Tamako has become Cannotgo. Even waiter went to hide inside the cashier."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdEthUmhnRRAB,Tamako Meal,5,Affordable and good quality Japanese food.  I like the service where they provide free flow of hot tea.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZekxIOUlREAE,Tamako Meal,5,"We had these and then some!

10/10 would return!

Awesome service and ambience as well!
Great array of selection for sake lovers too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMHNlR3VnRRAB,Tamako Meal,4,"Homely food options. Noodles like soba, ramen or rice bowls are available. Our dons came with miso soup."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dkpEdG5BRRAB,Tamako Meal,2,"Food served cold during weekday lunch . Waited for long time to be served lunch.
Service was bad with staff more interested in their phone than customers.
Service was bad.
Food quality deteriorated ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQya3BMWElnEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"We tried the following:
》Butashoga Ramen | Their signature shio-tonkotsu broth topped with hand-pulled pork sautéed in a sweet soy sauce and ginger was absolutely delish, I totally understand now why it's one of their bestsellers. The balanced flavours coming from the rich soup, saucy meat, sweetness from the braised bamboo shoots and green scallions was delightful.

》Miso Ramen | Such a hearty ramen which was infused with a generous amount of roasted Hokkaido red miso tonkotsu soup base, perfectly paired with the various toppings of sweet corn, slow-braised chashu pork slices, thinly sliced green scallions and beansprouts. The robust medley of flavours were simply delectable.

》Takoyaki | These Octopus Balls had a pillowy filling complimented by the mayonnaise, Japanese BBQ sauce and seaweed toppings. I took a mouthful and the flavours just bursted in my mouth, so addictive.

》Deep Fried Gyoza | Crispy deep-fried dumplings which had a substantial amount of chicken/veggie filling.

》Chilli Crab Matcha Macchiato with Fresh Milk (New) | Being adventurous at heart, I instantly knew that I had to give this one a go once I saw it on the menu. It was quite (weird) unique and certainly not for the faint-hearted! Try it for yourselves if you're brave enough like me ~"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaTRDNmpRRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Good location, ample carpark. Small eatery, be prepared to queue. Wonderful aroma while waiting helps to whip up appetite. 24 hours. You have traditional pork ramen of choice or singapore inspired flavours like chilli crab, salted egg yolk and bubble tea.

Good place for your cravings quick fix."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMkwzWnZBRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Wow very nice. Authentic taste at 3am. Got the Takagi ramen. Close to Tonkotsu. Very nice broth. Chashu a bit thin like ham, but for $6 how to complain. Super value.

Venue a bit tight but ok. If you go late the tray collector thing gets filled so old soup bowls overflowing.

Got ePay but nets only. Parking’s a bit far unless gamble right up front."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXZUclR3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,"The menu here is quite extensive with lots of variants and the flagship Butashoga is a pretty good at such a low price-point. Sadly, the other ramen we tried was a flop and the extra sides we had are pretty run-of-the-mill fried food. But nonetheless, at the rate they “Kanzen”, we are sure to be back again to try their other ramen."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydGY3czZnRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"The ramen at Takagi are very affordable for the average Singaporean. Craving for some spiciness, we ordered the Karaka and their seasonal Chilli Crab Ramen.

Initially I thought how spicy can Japanese Ramen get, right? Then I realise I was wrong. The spicy ramen here at Takagi are really spicy. I enjoyed both the flavourful ramen especially that Ajitama Egg that is done well with runny egg yolk.

We also ordered the Nori Tempura with Truffle Mayo and their most popular Deep Fried Gyoza. Love the crispiness in both the side dish that added a crunch to our meals."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNS1icG13RRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,1,"I see the comments are positive, but I don't think so!
Bad attitude of the staff!
I ordered with extra noodles, but the staff forgot to add noodles for me, So I went to Ramen Station ask for extra noodles with the staff, When I asked the staff,he was quite , when I asked again he threw the noodles in front of me!
Felt like I owed him money or killed his family!!!😡😡
Restaurant was very small , All is self collect self service .
Food was normal,but is cheaper."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXd3M3aDdRRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"I find this place good and cheap.
Order the truffle Ramen the taste not that much of truffle but it's smell incredible for that price below 10 leh.
And the karage also combo with drinks.
It's cheap and also very delicious at the price of such.
Highly recommend it!
The place also seating now due to covid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X0pQRGVnEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"The only ramen place that you can get free Raman and additional raman for 0.50. The Raman is worth the money generous portions of the char siew. First time eat Raman and had trouble finishing the meat. They having a promotion 1 for 1 for student and the tako ball is really nice and the taro drinks with the Pearl taste great and refreshing.

Love the value the owner is giving. nowdays hawker food can cost even more than takagi."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWUyRy1RRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,Decent ramen at much more affordable prices. They also give the additional noodles.  Good service. Can save time by ordering online then collect at store.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMXVfVHpnRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"My waitress, Peggy was very friendly and helpful. She took good care if us. The food was very good and freshly made. Great place to eat ramen. Highly recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cDQ2ZVpnEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,Limited seats ramen served warm not hot at all Self pick up and even condiments just grab as u wish as the condiments fill up to only 1/4 of it waste of container. And no Hygiene put in place when they won't notice if I throw back any unused condiments after I took them out for says 45min. But staff was good tho will give it a 3 for that. Not recommended for anyone who loves their ramen to be served Hot.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0ktVVh3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,2,"Food was decent. But there was a fight among the staff during peak period lunch time. Fighting was pretty loud. Partly due to the overwhelming orders both walk-in customers and food delivery orders.

The worst part was that I overheard the kitchen staff telling one of the staff to inform the customer to get their food while calling the customers 白痴 (idiots).

Note: it’s a self service restaurant which people might not know and the self service counter is all the way at the back.

This incident occurred on Sunday, 10/04/2022,  1.45pm."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcC02Z1JREAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,"Cheap and affordable and taste good as well. Don’t recommend the bubble tea though - taste weird.

For delivery, please be aware that the restaurant will take way longer to deliver than whatever is stated in the app. I took them an additional hour to deliver my food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2NXRlZnVRRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Visited this outlet yesterday to try their ramen. The prices are really more affordable than usual ramen restaurants. Generous portions given for all noodles and free extra noodles too!

The broth is not bad, not too oily imho while the char shu is average, although they do put in a lot of pieces :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaExxT1N3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Splendid, 24 Hours, customers queuing and best of it is I work here ! Just joking

( Hi owner, my just joking means That the outlet is popular because of Me working there, sorry for the confusion )

Anyway one if your staffs, which I can said is my colleague, Named David is a very cool and nice guy. No bossing around, no putting on airs, very patient with me and understanding too. He's a great guy.

We Tagaki Ramen at AMK is Hydeine 1st."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydHFTZEV3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,Best ramen! Authentic Japanese ramen with rich broth and generous servings. Free x1 serving of noodle but I think it’s not needed as they already gave a generous portion of noodle in the soup. Highly recommend and will definitely come again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyc0lHdU93EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Served by Auntie Peggy, friendly staff. Free additional ramen per order, i finished all as it is yummy. Affordable price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2LTZiVnNBRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,Ordered self pick-up through Grabfood and the items were packed nicely. Noodles were ok and sufficient to fill me up. The price is quite reasonable for the quality.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMUpMM1RREAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Located right behind the S11 outside of AMK Hub. The stall is fairly sized to accommodate for 7 tables of diners, orders are processed quickly too despite the vast amount of delivery order the store has.

Do note that the ramen does not comes with egg by default, it will be available as a $1 top up. Broth is not overly oily and noodles are al dante. Nothing spectacular over the ramen but it serves its purpose to satisfy your ramen cravings.

Bonus: Noodle upsize is available for free!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdWFfR2dnRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Finally got to try the legendary 24h ramen raved about by Steven Lim korkor and it was top tier…on the list of most mediocre fast food style ramen. We got the karakamen + egg + cha shu and it was most certainly a hearty supper. I like that the cha shu slices are thin and relatively tender, though you’ll have to soak the extra pieces in the broth for a while to get some added flavor."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdGJpaTl3RRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Cheap and delicious!! The space is a little bit small so if coming in group of more than 2 person, high chance will have to wait a while as there are limited seats for bigger groups , but the staffs are super friendly and nice!

Their ice flavoured tea is good, along with the Pearl, which is probably better than the ones at Koi HAHAHA"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbklLYnFnRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,Auntie Peggy was super friendly and she was mindful that my children and I was standing in the sun while queueing got a table. She showed us to an area under the shade outside while looking out for a table for us..her service is tip top and food was sumptuous and value for money!! This is our first time trying after seeing long queue outside always..we’ll come back again! Thank you Auntie Peggy!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcW96MXdBRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,Pretty decent tongkotsu and miso ramen! The free ramen noodles top up comes in a huge portion. Knocked one star off cos personally I found the soup on the saltier side. Otherwise glad to have found a 24H ramen place!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbnZIOW5BRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Lovely food , only down side is that the place is very tiny.  Had to squeeze when someone walks past"

Kudos to the team's training and upholding standards to good customer service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhby0zMEJBEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Ordered from Foodpanda a couple of times. Loving the environmental conscious packaging! and the cute little sincere note with every order, really brings up the positive experience with the brand! Not the most amazing ramen, but it's half the price and the service is awesome so heck yeah I'll support!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ2VYWHR3RRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,"Tantanmen is nice, tastes more like Chinese cuisine instead of Japanese Ramen though
Takagi Ramen is also nice, quite thick broth, flavourful
Gyoza and Takoyaki is average, don't feel like it's worth the price
Matcha Latte is tasting close to Starbucks'

So why the missing 2 stars?
For starter, there are fly fly throughout our meal
Then, I saw a drop of 💧 attacking my Gyoza!! When I look up, yes indeed the Airconditioner is there...
So yea, the 2 missing stars are due to the environment, very bad, I'd be trying other outlets for the ramen, but not this outlet, scared liao 😆

I mean..., such a waste to lose points in environment..., maybe some renovations should take place 🤔"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNV9lRlBBEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Despite the 10 min wait to eat during lunch hour, we were well attended to by Peggy. She offered to have my son stand in the restaurant area as it was really hot outside and gave him tissue to wipe his sweat.

Yea!Your shop has the worst type of system ever!
I advise my customer to cancel after explaining the situation.the customer even gave me a thumbs up and agree to cancel.If not I think I will wait for 2hrs tonight and miss all my other earnings.

If you have only a few staff,remember! Customers in your shop are your priority!Not deliveries!Understand so far!?
Your shop already is so so so small,delivery riders like us crowding at the collection area you think is a good scene?

Use your brain Use your brain!"

1 star for the very very very long wait.
Went at off peak timing at 5pm. Place was relatively empty but due to numerous super huge delivery order, had to wait almost 25 to 30 min for food

So average out to a 3 stars here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb1lHUzh3RRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,My daughters and I enjoyed the breakfast selection which are suitable for Sunday morning brunch. The service was quick and friendly. Peggy was particularly helpful 👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcHAyMlJ3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,1,"It’s been an hour since i placed my order for delivery and even the delivery guy waited at the restaurant for more than half an hour… the restaurant is STILL preparing and pushing back the delivery time. Assuming it is expedited right as I type this review, it would have reached me more than 90min since I placed the order. When my delivery arrive, the delivery man also say it wasn’t busy and they must have missed out the order. Yet they denied. Worst late night meal ever. Avoid ordering at all cost!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bnJ1LU93EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,2,"Food quality not bad for the price but the soup is not flavourful enough. Bad service. I asked for help as it’s my first time. The staff only pointed the ordering machine to me and did not inform me that I have to collect my drink at separate counter. When I collected my ramen, I asked where’s my tea, then the kitchen staff shouted loudly telling me to go collect from the front. They shouted as if it’s my fault for not knowing and they did not say clearly which part of the “front”! During my short meal there, I witnessed same treatment was given to another customer. Such horrible service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTZ01YYU5BEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,Came around 1.30pm not much queue. The spicy ramen is spicy enough but if you are hungry recommend to add extra noodles. Staff very helpful -asked for more spring onions and got them
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpeE5YTlRREAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"I have to say that I really enjoyed the ramen at this little joint Takagi. Expect to wait as it’s a small place. I ordered the tantanramen with extra spicy, which is really delicious. Even the gyoza was tasty. The experience was like one of those little eateries in Japan and you have to order through the machine at the entrance. Will definitely come back again when I have ramen craving at anytime as this place opens 24 hours!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aWRhb2JREAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,"Service was good but what disappoint me is the dish. When the noodles are served, the soup was already cold where it make me loose appetite when i’m adding the additional noodle as it became hard and cold. This only happened today. Previously when I visited the shop, the dishes were served hot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDVfWFZBEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Well priced for what you get. However, noodles were a tad mushy. Soup is decent!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaEtXaWV3EAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,Definitely affordable.  I think portion is just right.. they have self order kisok at the entrance.. the only thing is instructions were not clear that there is drink collection and food collection counters. May be hard for first timers to self figure out.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNTd2RmVBEAE,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Peggy  is very friendly n helpful, got us a seat pretty quick even though the place is already pretty packed. We’ll come back again for sure because of her.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvM1ppSTBRRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,4,"Hidden at a popular heartland area, this gem definitely serve up a good bowl of ramen. Broth are fantastic but the noodles are a little lacking. The convenient location pretty much makes up for it though!

Would have given it 5 star if their self ordering kiosk accepts credit card as a payment method."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4ZzZTZm5nRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,5,"Enjoyed the affordably priced meal and sides. I also appreciate the self ordering machine that mimics the Japanese style.

Place is a bit cramped though, and the table looks like it can fit at most 4 people."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bjR6Q2lBRRAB,Takagi Ramen - Ang Mo Kio,3,"Ordered via Grabfood and was rather disappointed overall.  It's a place for affordable, alright food but avoid the drinks.

Good
+ Affordable
+ Rather eco-friendly package
+ Appreciate thought towards packaging food and drink items properly - the noodles came in a presentable manner and even tho the drink spilled, I saw that the restaurant already used tape to tape down the cup cover to try and avoid that

Bad
- The drinks were not cheap and tasted really bad. The matcha latte cost 3.6 on Grabfood after discount but tasted like sugar water with some artifical matcha taste. Tastes like a diluted + sweetened version of those 3-in-1 matcha latte mix you can find in supermarkets, definitely not worth a few dollars
- Got the ""melon milk"" buddy set on Grabfood and the melon milk also tastes diluted and artificial"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaHFENVJ3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,2,Ordered the beef curry and the fried chicken on grab. The food was ok at best and the rice was a bit too wet and mushy for my liking. Would prefer for them to separate the curry from the rice so the rice won’t soak up the curry.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHF6clhnEAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,3,"Need a quick dinner so decided to settle it here. Used Burpple 1-for-1 deal so it is very affordable.

Ordered Katsu Chicken don and Tempura don. Each set came with a miso soup. Miso flavour is not very strong.

The tempura did not come with a dipping sauce which is a bit disappointing. Katsu Chicken was acceptable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcF9YVnRnRRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,5,"The stall presentation was interesting and fascinating. I was drawn into the stall and made an order here. Wanted to try their wagyu or curry but I know my son won't eat those instead I got ebi tempura. It wasn't the same as donburi at other stall. It came with sweet potato tempura as well. The egg was nicely shaped and looking nice.

Didn't manage to try the ebi cause my son took them all. I will come again to try their other dishes."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbV92VjN3RRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,5,"Seems like many bad reviews.  I ate once at the stall and do a take out once.

Eating there is perfect. Waiting time was acceptable. maybe about 5-10min? Food served warm, condiments was all at the side table. Chilli powder, wasabi and soy sauce. Egg onsen was ok, beef was good as this is a coffee shop. Agree is more expensive but Wagyu beef and it tasted good. I don't mind paying for it..

For take out, it dries out a little for the rice but thats acceptable.  They gave me soup also. Packaging was good. No leakage."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxa3BDcUl3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,2,"I have to say the food here is super inconsistent.

My first time ordering:
Got their beef donburi with broccoli, salmon Miso soup and mentaiko sauce.
Beef was good as it had flavourful and wasn't too dry. Broccoli we're kinda disappointing as it was just plain broccoli boiled in water and there were only 2 pieces. For the salmon Miso soup, it tasted good without being overly salty. Mentaiko sauce is spicier that your regular mentaiko and somehow the mentaiko is milder.
Overall I enjoyed my meal and this taste better than Yoshinoya if you need comparison. I also like how their portion is slightly larger.

Update: I ordered another 3 more times from them so a total of 4 times on 4 different days.

For my 2nd order I was super impressed. They added more seaweed to their don And the flavours were good. Only sad thing was the onsen egg with the broken yolk. But other than that it was a wonderful meal.

For my 3rd order, it was HORRIBLE, just look at the pictures attached. The rice was just lump together and mushy. How could they actually serve such rice to their customers? The boiled egg though perfectly cooked was just roughly handle, look at the broken egg white. For the protein this time, I got their wagyu flank beef and boy was that a mistake. Tough, flavourless piece of meat with some parts having some black pepper taste. For the price I was charged, I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED with this meal

For my 4th order which was during the week dine-in was allowed, I decided to give them another chance. Let me say I TOTALLY regretted my choice. Rice was AGAIN lumpy and mushy but this time it wasn't that bad only like 1/2 of the rice had this issue. This was during dinner time. What is wrong with them? Can't they even get the basic right anymore? Also I got the SALMON soup which this time apparently didn't contain any SALMON. Instead, was replaced with a small cube of tofu and a lot of kelp.

Hope they can really look into it and be consistent in their execution. My first 2 experience were great but the 3rd one and 4th just left be disappointed. Honestly if that was the first bowl that I had, I would have never chosen to order from them ever again. I don't know if their standards are dropping or if I'm ordering at very bad timings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbWN6OHBBRRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,3,"Value for $ deal, 2 x Unagi for $18.

Taste wise pretty ok, rice was ok. The Unagi lacked the sauce the gives the flavor but nonetheless it wasn't dry and meat was tender."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtekw2QWpRRRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,3,Not the cheapest donburi but the portion is larger than most and tastes similar to some restaurant chains. Plus point for being halal
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeTlDYTF3RRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,3,"Ordered the saba fish don and it comes with complementary salad and miso soup.

Fish is a lil too light in terms of flavor. Could’ve been crispier on the skin and marinated more."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeGRYX1h3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,2,"Tried out the Wagyu Don but was utterly dissapointed. Presentation was well but the beef was hard and tasted gamey probably not removing the enough blood from the meat or not well marinated.

Same as what other reviewer said, I'm giving 2 stars for the sake of the stall is Halal which is rare to find one in a food stall environment."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X003M2FnEAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,1,Uncooked and dry rice. Not even sure if Japanese rice was used. Terrible pre cooked fried chicken which is cold. Beef has no sauce this dry . Please don’t waste your money. I want to put zero stars… because was deceived my the Japanese chef’s poster so gave it a try.

Nice japanese food with restaurant standard but in affordable price. You can mix and match your favourite set with the sauces based on your preference.

Overall worth giving 5 stars 👍🏻"

Upon collecting my way Signature Wagyu Flank Donburi. To my surprise I saw the beef looks like well done. The person in charge mentioned that the beef is like that don't bother seeing the picture as it's illustrated and he quoted 'this is OUR standard'!!!!!

The beef was dry and tough, the rice was too dry and it cost $17. Its my WORST experience.. its so bad that I have no words to for it. I went to ask around and many had experience it too. SO Please don't go through this terrible experience!! And learned from our mistake..

Ps. Do not be fool by their Head and Master chef marketing!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeUpuMFF3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,5,Just found out this halal restaurant  recently & ordered through grab. It serves salmon & unagi meals !! Hard to find halal food that sell this kind of meals.  👍👍  love the sauce too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbGZTWkF3EAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,1,"Ordered Mentai Salmon Don, chicken katsu curry sauce don and tempura platter.
Salmon tasted like it has been boiled then pan fried.
The batter of the tempura platter is extremely hard and the prawn is slipping away when you take a bite. It is as though they fried it when the prawn is frozen.
The chicken katsu curry sauce don is average. Not worth the price at all"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NGZyVkxREAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,2,Tried the signature wagyu steak and it is quite dissapointed. Meat is a bit tough and need more seasoning. Rice is too much.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNDh2RllREAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,1,"Mentaiko Salmon Don is terrible taste. Overpriced too.. if taste is good then price will be acceptable. But taste is low quality, no standard. Mentaiko sauce like machiam mayonnaise. Don't waste your time ordering Mentai Salmon Don. Add mentai sauce (mayonnaise taste) for $2 not worth it also. It would be ok if the taste is good. Unagi is decent and taste good for $12. Recommend to go shopping mall eat better, aircon, cheaper, taste better. Only wanted to support local but the result is disappointing. Enjoy your meal. STAY away from their fake ""mentai sauce'"

One of the best Japanese delivery on grab💪"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM09LZzFRRRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,5,Excellent food! Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard of Halal Donburi. Definitely fine dining bought into hawker centre atmosphere 😂 It can be expensive but worth it and they do different deals on different delivery platform and they even have Burpple (1-for-1). I have purchased from them through Foodpanda and they got like 50% OFF so it’s worth checking them out before you order your donburi. You could save alot! Highly recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb1plLVFnEAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,3,The portion is quite small and it was about 10 dollars for a curry don which is overpriced and the food was not that impressive.It is halal.

I had the curry don. The curry was a little less unfortunately, but the meat was thick and tasty.
Will return for more."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOFlqV2tBRRAB,Donburi no Tatsujin,1,Ordered the wagyu flank for $17. Portion and taste  mediocre. Sweet potato tempura was poor. Potato salad was ok. Not worth the money or time.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdHZlMVJREAE,Donburi no Tatsujin,5,New Japanese food stall tucked in a corner of coffeeshop. Their food is nice. Average $8 to $9 per person. You can choose two sides and either rice or noodles to go along with the food.

Teriyaki sauce too sweet. Sliced cabbage potion is miserable.
Long queue, its because one man operation.
Overrated, not really worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaDhlaUpREAE,Konomi Zen,4,"Went around lunchtime on weekday. The queue is long, waiting time about 30min. Ordered the chicken teriyaki bento set. The chicken teriyaki is nice. Priced at 4.50."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4eDdUT0xnEAE,Konomi Zen,5,Have been a regular devotee of their tempura set for the past 5 years. It's basically sushi teh quality at hawker center prices. So  reasonably priced that you can patronize every day. The boss is very hard-working and friendly don't be taken aback when he talks loud because the environment is noisy. I also recommend their salmon dishes which are very popular. Do visit early as there will be a take out queue that form during peak hours. Highly recommended and a culinary gem that showcase the best of Japanese food at down to earth pricing. 💎
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bTlLMUhREAE,Konomi Zen,1,"Standards dropped a lot, and I mean a lot. Ordered chicken don earlier for lunch, waited for more than half an hour, yet rice is not fully cooked, chicken is either not fresh or not defrost well. Awful experience and probably not in my lunch list moving forward."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX3MyVTFnRRAB,Konomi Zen,5,"Tried the salmon bento and fish bento. The sheer length of the salmon slice is impressive, and while the regular fish looks slightly more modest, both of them tasted fresh, flavourful, while not being too salty. The amount of fish to rice ratio was great. The tempura carrot was still crispy at the end of my meal and the soup also wasn't too salty or diluted. Probably the best Japanese food I've tried, especially at this very affordable price point of $10.50 for two bentos. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwbklyeGx3RRAB,Konomi Zen,3,"“Restaurant standard Hawker price” is what you will find on their signboard instead of Konomi Zen which is not reflected.

Past them by so many times but never bothered to try so today finally ordered their Teriyaki chicken set.
It’s lunch time there’s not much of a Q, but the customer flow is quite consistent.

The boss/Chef has an aura about him, feels like he was the head chef of some high end Japanese Omakase restaurant.
Back to their teriyaki chicken set. At $4.50 it is quite a steal if u compare it with Sakae Shushi.

I believe they use calrose rice (short grain type), it was a bit dry.
The chicken itself was oki, but becomes an impact when u eat it with their panko
Came with a fried sweet potato which was fantastic.

Overall it’s an oki but affordable Japanese lunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcnV6VGJ3EAE,Konomi Zen,3,"Food wise, value for money. But one thing I never like about this stall is, the queueing system. No one bothers to organise the queue. Sometimes when you stand there, you don't know if the person in front has ordered or not. And the owner and assistant don't care. When you try to order through the assistant, he will tell you chef will take order from you and hack care. I never like this type of disorganised queue system. If not for my kids, I won't bother patronising."

I ordered the teriyaki chicken bento for $4.50, very reasonable priced for  Japanese food. The teriyaki chicken pieces rested on a bed of tempura crispy flour with drizzled sauce, chicken taste soft and nice but to me is not marinated enough. The rice is probably Thai rice version with salad and a bowl of soup. The surprise touch was the freshly fried tempura carrot slide, nice and crispy!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRenZmWHBnRRAB,Konomi Zen,5,Truly restaurant standard hawker price. The salmon so big I was surprised it's only $6 per set. And it's delicious too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBaUxiNWZREAE,Konomi Zen,5,Taste and portion size is decent considering the price. Most of the food are cooked on the spot. Stall owner is friendly and will address you as bro or sis regardless of your age.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOGJydU1BEAE,Konomi Zen,5,Good Japanese food at a hawker centre! Their signature salmon set gives u a large piece of salmon fillet and love the tempura there!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGVqZmlnRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,Enjoyed the concept of solo BBQ! It can really be done within an hour! The portion is just right for me. Choice of sauces were good. Didn’t have a long wait on PH lunch time~ will go back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybHB2SU13EAE,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),3,"A neighborhood joint to get a quick yakiniku fix. Food wise is alright I guess. Price to portion rato is on the higher side. Service was ok. Expect to queue during peak periods; but the online queue number service was neat. While I think the quality of the standard meat selections was fair, the premium selection touted as A5 was below expectations. There was a wide variety of condiments for the choosing. Drinks were served right out of their commercial bottles. The interior is rather cramped and quite hot, thus not a place you would want to be in other than to eat and go. The relatively short timing (yes there is a dining window) also made the whole experience feel a little rushed. Do note that the buzzer doesn't ring and just vibrates. For a while I thought there were some renovations going on only to realize it was the buzzer all along, LOL. Parking is plenty in the Hub itself."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM0l5WFJnEAE,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),5,"No frills yakiniku outlet at AMK hub. Our first visit here. Jun Ming was patient enough to explain how the restaurant works (different from Suntec) and introduce us their seasonal menu (Hokkaido pork) which is a must-try.

Even though queue was pretty long, it was moving along just fine. We had a great dinner and would be back again in the future. 🙂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ3NMMnpnRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,"Interesting concept but quite pricey given that everything is self-service. Meat variations offered in menu was good but portion wasn’t enough for me even with 200g of meat. Most of the meat was mildly pre-seasoned but you can add more salt/pepper/others as you like, was delicious. Kimchi was interesting, had strong alcohol taste."

Ordered the Quattro set as well as extra beef tongue and short ribs.

The staff are young and some are obviously new but you can tell they are trying their best at service.

So give them a smile and they would appreciate it!

The rice was the only thing that I would pick on as it seems a tad too mushy for our liking."

Ordered the 300g pork belly + chicken rice set, as well as 100g sukiyaki beef.

Love the garlic soy sauce with the meats!
Chicken tigh is chunky, and not marinated, hence not as flavourful.

The grill pan area was not cleaned throughout on this visit, hope this can be better!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdThLeXlBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),5,"Prime Karubi and Pork Belly were really good and able to select rice amount for big eaters. Price is reasonable and there are different sets available for selection, or you can order the meat a la carte. Layout of the place is ideal for people who are eating alone as well. Payment is fast with self payment kiosk as well. Long waiting time of about 70 minutes so be prepared to wait during peak meal times."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOGQ3bjNRRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),5,"Curiosity cause me to visit this newly opened self serve quick grill establishment. Quite a refreshing alternative to the pepper lunch outlet above.

Recommend to come early as I did before lunch or dinner hour as queue is norm. I selected the sukiyaki karubi set and it was delicious 😋.

The secret is in the marinate and the quick sear cooking that locks in the flavors while maintaining the tenderness of the beef which pairs well with the soy garlic sauce and the onsen egg 🥚.

Comparatively value for money especially if you compare between other meat based offerings.
Will come back again.. 😄"

The Wagyu and karubi had nice marbling, and melts in your mouth. I like that the kimchi is sweet before the spice hits. Miso soup is alright.

Will visit again."

This is probably only concern from me."

Do also come early to avoid the extremely long waiting time, which may take up to 2 hours during peak hours. For those who can’t afford to wait, you can always go for their takeaway menu bento meals which features the exact same items and the meat is properly cooked for you!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbC1qQktnEAE,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),1,Was here early so no q. Meat was decent for the price paid. But the hygiene standard definitely needs to be improved. Found a super long strand of hair right in middle of my bowl of rice. Disgusting
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWF2SFBnEAE,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,"Tried the Karubi and Harami set. Meat is well marinated and the sauce complements it quite well. Quite a huge serving of rice for the sets - that's what makes you full after perhaps 200g of meat.

Order is done via scanning a QR code and submitting your choices via a webpage. The buzzer on your table will ring when your food is ready for collection. Payment is made via a kiosk at the exit. This self-service concept is different from other outlets. It's slightly weird because most of the staff are just standing around doing nothing most of the time.

Update Jul 2022: The staff will bring the food to your seat when it's ready. However there's a long wait for the food after you place the order."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMGVEcE5nEAE,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,Nice setup with individual grill for each person. Do be prepared to wait for a table and allocations of tables will run out. Love the array of sauces that can accompany your meats.

Yakiniku offers BBQ lovers a quick and easy way to enjoy it, without the long preparation times and smells on your clothing.

Prices are affordable and value for money.

Quite a popular chain restaurant, so do come early.

This outlet is self service, very intuitive for customers that listen to instructions from the staff or who bother to read the signs. No fuss dining."

Saw this piece of plastic among my meat and told the staff to tell their kitchen to be more careful, she went “uh ya okay” her reply toward other customer was rather substandard too.

I gave 2 stars cause the salad was nice, the rest for this price you can pay a bit more and go for free flow."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN0stVXVBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,"Affordable yakiniku place, however for big eaters may not be the best price(Big eaters may have to go for large rice[Upsize is free] and more meat). Meat is ok, ordered the Like set which has harami, short plate and tongue and ordered extra pork jowl. Best meats were the harami and pork jowl. The grill can be set to high or low temp, which is good for giving meats like harami a nice sear but not cooking it entirely to keep the inside juicy. However given that you are only given 50 mins i think most people will just set it at the highest temp. The grill is quite small, recommend going solo cause even if you go as a group you are still using the same sized grill, so 50 mins may not be enough. And because of the 50 mins time limit maybe hence why the meats are cut thin for quick cooking time. Same concept to ramen shops in Japan, you're going in for a fast meal not a social gathering. I would go again solo but if i we were to gather with friends i would go other yakiniku places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyemNqMnpnRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),3,I just feel I can get more food per dollar spent at other bbq joints. I wasn’t even full after eating the 200g beef set.

They should use the same booking system as sushiro, where you need to go down to the outlet physically to check in again in order to be part of the queue.

Nice food though, been here many times 😁"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaXJic3ZBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),2,"First outlet to have a self service concept. BUT I’m not entirely sure if this self service concept is going to work.

What happened was staffs basically just stood around doing nothing. 2 staffs stood at the entrance, basically doing nothing. Another stood at the self payment counter, who tried to give instructions that isn’t clear nor loud.

Further back, you have more staffs gathering together, talking among themselves, or standing behind customers, asking them if they can clear their plates the second they picked up that last piece of meat to grill.

Food wise, standards aren’t exactly comparable to other outlets, the spicy miso sauce seemed to be a lot thicker and salter; the garlic miso was quite diluted. The meats also came drenched in sauce which made for uneven and inconsistent cooking.

Management needs to look into their staffs at this outlet. If they are already this unmotivated to serve customers within their first 3 days of opening, it does not bode well for their future. Either they need a new store management who know how to handle operations, or these staffs need to go for customer service and communications training. Self service concept is not something for you to hide behind while your staffs stand in 1 corner and slack."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNW9pTThBRRAB,Yakiniku Like (AMK Hub),4,"Joy the bandwagon to try why this one always have a long queue.  We waited for more than 1 hour to get a 3 pax table.  We ordered 3 sets with Wagyu steak, harami, beef steak slice, ox tongue, karubi and premium karubi.  The Wagyu beef is disappointing, not tender enough and also not strong enough for the fatty fragrance (already can tell from the marble pattern).  The beef steak slice is very dry.  The harumin is ok, tender and tends to be a bit chewy (but is ok).  The karubi is very good.  Ox tongue is extremely tender.  Last the stove is not coal but gas.  And the sauces are good - the Like BBQ and Salty sauce.  Overall it is not exception ally good but is definitely value for money, especially for the lower price point items - karubi.  Worth to try.  Last last last, why can't the queuing system can ask the customer to input HP number and can send SMS to us like 5 tables ahead?  This is a very common feature is many systems."

As it’s a fairly new concept of a self-service outlet from their other outlets, there’s always areas of improvement. I just hope people are not so quick to criticise the staff & or systems, but rather to provide more positive & encouraging words for their growth. Everyone needs a “booster” now & then for continuous development.

They have a few outlets across the island also. Of course they are not your authentic Japanese or Korean cuisine that you would die for, but the taste is somewhat there. With such affordae prices and their portion of a meal is value for money, I can't complain.

Most of their food are made to order. Mostly are fried or teppanyaki style. The usual sauces or ingredients are teriyaki, Japanese mayonnaise, katsu items, pickled vegetables and Kimchi.

Their hotplate soba fish looks quite popular here. It comes with a seaweed soup and rice. Their bento sets looks nice too. In total they have about 40 items on the menu.

Overall its good enough to eat for lunch and dinner if you just bored of Chinese or western food."

I give it 4 stars for doing what it is doing with this budget.

Had the teriyaki chicken don. The chicken taste a bit like western chicken chop, but it was pretty good size. The overall taste is conservative, maybe because of the neighborhood taste.

We are in smiles to have a robot bringing us to our table, so cute!

We love how the food is delivered in an enclosed conveyor belt like a bullet train  zipping around and only opens up when our food is delivered to our table like a suprise box.
Thumbs up for being hygienic as I would not like to have my food, going around like old school conveyor sushi belt, uncovered and getting expose to whatever is in the air.
The service staff are attentive too.

Menu selections are very interesting, we tried lots of variety that wasn't common. It's a welcome change.

Gonna bring the kids along next time, they will be so excited over this Futuristic robot concept.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZzdfbmpnRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"I see a lot of mixed reviews here so I decided to try for myself. Heard was quite hyped people queued for hours when it opened.
I visited on a weekday lunch there was no queue got immediate seating. Was quite cute there was a robot which showed me to the table. Way or ordering food was quite standard. Didn't like the table for 2 was really small and narrow.
Wowed by the menu. Didn't expect they had such a wide range of dishes, and the price was really cheap. Kept scrolling and took quite a while to order the dishes. Time taken for food to arrive was quite fast except for the Agedashi tofu, okay since they had to fry it upon order and it was hot when it arrived.
Was a hit for me for the food quality as I found them pretty good and satisfied. Nothing was not fresh or tasted bad and seriously nothing to complain for the price you are paying.
Things I didn't like was that the table for 2 was really small, so if you really order quite a lot of things you find yourself not having space to put the plates. They tried to consolidate orders by putting a few types of sushi in a plate but still the space was lacking.
Don't know if it's because of this the staff keep coming to the table trying to clear the plates. It was a mixed reaction because on one hand I found it quite disturbing wondering if the kitchen is lacking plates or they are trying to be nice to free up table space. I didn't like it when you are having a meal and conversation and the staff keep coming to disrupt.
Although the staff keep coming to clear the plates, when you need attention from them you just can't get their attention. They served the matcha cheesecake without any spoons we raised our hands for a few minutes before someone noticed us. Think it should be default to provide dessert teaspoons with the dessert or have some in the drawer under the table.
The only thing I felt funny was a female staff whenever she came to clear the plates she would always knock into something and go ""oh my god oh my god"".
Meal wise the bill was really reasonable. Enjoyed it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d2FtVkpnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"Came in with decent expectation but was utterly disappointed by the quality and taste of the food :(

Sushi go, you have so much potential. I think you can do better.....

Fried Salmon skin very hard and clumped together.

The unagi thing really taste very creative/weird. Please don't."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0xLY3N3RRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"Waiting time is almost an hour on a weekend lunch time. Recommended to go at around 2:30-3pm where there are lesser crowd.
Sushi standards were mediocre, for the price I would prefer other express sushi place or Ichiban Sushi instead. The butter soyu is a tat too sweet. Maybe it’s newly open, they always forgot the customers order. I overheard 2 tables with missing orders, same as us when we visit, orders forgotten but were marked as Completed in the system.
The seating is pretty small, I guess petite size people will feel more comfortable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a2FUSEZnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Just want to say thank you and congratulations to the crews! The two days opening specials are crazy especially for them, I got the queue number at 12 and only dine in at 8 yet it was definitely satisfying. The crews did extremely well to cope with the demands and imagine how much pressure they have to handle whole day from the customers. The manager even came to apologise to me for waiting so long which to me is already going extra miles for the customers. Keep it up 💪"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc0lUckNnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"Alright sushi in AMK Hub with an alright price point. Interior design is cute and clean. Food quality varies vastly between different sushi. Most of the sushi we had were pretty alright, with the exception of the yellowtail which tasted really dry and weird. Also because of their train system, some of their sushi arrives toppled. Another flaw would be that the 2 pax table is a little small after all the tea and shoyu and tissue box taking up the space, meaning that you can't order too many plates at once. Then again their sushi comes really slowly and one at a time. Waiting time could be improved. One of our orders was also forgotten by the kitchen and had to remind the staff about it, but due to lack of staff it was hard to get their attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bllPN2N3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Love my dinner there. The interior was really cute and attractive. Was lots of fun even for adults to have their food come in the cute bots. Every time it opens, we get a surprise, more hygienic than the other similar concept. The staff were very polite as well. Understand there might be some teething issues due to the sudden hype which is pretty normal. Hope everyone get to try Sushigo at least once!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NzlqZmtBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Nice place to bring kids along.  Sushi is nice, affordable prices.
AI leading to our seats, interesting for kids."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlby1yVkdnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,Visited outlet around 4.30pm off peak period. We glad to have Sushi Go in Ang Mo Kio Hub cause previous only have one which is at Jurong Point. Even its not much customer but we found that two staff Vicky & Poh Lian providing good service. They keep attention on every customer. Always keep our table clean and tidy. Company should rewards their good service. 👍🏻  Keep going!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cE5TN01nEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Had A Quick Lunch @ Newly Opened Sushi-Go. Waiting Time Wasnt Long . A Robot Ushered Me To My Seat. Scan & Order Via QR Code. Staffs Over There Were Friendly & Welcoming Too. Those Diff Emoji Faces Of Go-Bots Delivered My Food Looked So Cute Plus Efficient. The Sushi And Fried Stuffs Taste Great Too. Hope To See More Dessert Choices In Future Like Sushi Express. Spend Abt $19, Pretty Affordable. Located Near TimeZone/ Cinema, 4th Level."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aTRMd3ZBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,Nice place to get catch up with friends. Saw a lot of parents bring kids to see the fun train delivery of food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a2NEeE5nEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Queue is arnd 4hrs, went during $1 promo, started queuing at 1030. Started eating at 1430

Staff were friendly and helped us made our 3 tower stacks

Sashimi is 4/5 due to not being as cold as I'd expect. Nonetheless, great experience there"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXJ5dXVRRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"The new sushi conveyor belt concept. Very fresh Japan speed train decor. We love the conveyor belt because of the automatic delivery. The kids were having fun. It is also hygienic that the food is covered up until it reached our table. Sushi Go is very comparable to Genki Sushi in terms of concept and pricing. However, Genki Sushi's food is way much better than Sushi Go. Although the kids love Sushi Go's conveyor belt, i will still go to Genki Sushi for the nicer food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MG83bV9RRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,4,Decent price point and varieties to choose from. Ordered thru QR code and the food will be delivered right in front of you via the 'train'.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWJUQ013EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"For an experience not bad. Quite a number of sushi varieties to choose from. The Hamachi sashimi is a big disappointment, not fresh at all with the 4 pcs for $5+. Wonder why they serve unfresh sashimi in the first place to spoilt their branding.
And for $25 for 1 pax not a cheap option, didn't even order a lot of things.
Ok for 1st time experience, not really a regular goto place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGRLOTRnRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Absolute chaos upon opening time. Queue up for 1 hour+ to the end only to get a queue number that is estimated to be 3 hours or even longer, by the time it becomes dinner alr.😂 quite a number of people ragequitted. Could have just blanket cutoff the queue and not make everybody waste time queueing further. Probably will give this a miss."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWFLb25nRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"Cheaper than other “train” sushi places but you can taste the subpar quality as well.

Take something you like and make it better, not worse."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDdmQjhBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,4,"After the opening craze calm down, we manage to dine in for dinner. Food was alright, service is prompt and the sushi train is cute 😁 only downside it can be abit pricey, but im guessing the recent inflation cost went up too. ( so minus 1star)

The fries was surprisingly not bad. Maybe will come once in a looong time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d3VDUnBBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,Fun concept with robots serving the food. We waited an hour for our food even though we entered the store at its opening hours. The experience seems consistent as the customers who entered at the same time with us were all waiting as well. New store opened with lots of teething things to sort out in its operations.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMk5qVE5nEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,4,"Was initially reluctant to try this place given the many unfavourable reviews, but am so glad I gave it a shot.

The quality of the food considering the price point was excellent, way better than expected and definitely a mark above the sister restaurant ichiban sushi, also in amk hub. Loved the fried salmon skin (soo crisp) and potato salad (daughter claims its the best version ever). Miso soup was too salty for me though.

The robot ""waiter"" and cute trains will appeal to kids. The digital queue system was so convenient as well - you'll be prompted via text when your table is ready, so you can run your errands in the meantime.

Staff were sincere and customer centric. Well done!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjRmSk93EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"POSITIVES:

Food was alright, all the dishes were yummy and pretty good. Soft shell crab maki was yummy had this yuzu dressing inside which was refreshing. Staff were lovely trying to compensate for robot’s technical failures. Poor design feature. No call button to get staff’s attention, need to stand up to walk to the staff..
Being led to our table by TEMI robot was a novel experience.

NEGATIVES:
Spicy salmon sushi came smelling weird and like smelly socks + tasted weird too.

Ordered salmon belly sashimi. Never came. One robot came but inside was empty. The order  was marked as completed order. After a few requests, staff came personally to serve it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlemN6ak5REAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Dine in around dinner time on a weekday. It was fairly packed but the service was fast. The robot belt was super interesting!
Food quality was good! The price was reasonable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMk1MTW9RRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Food is ok, the wait is bad.
Not sure if they forgot our order. First few orders came about 10-15mins. Our handrolls however took more than 30mins, asked the waiter to check for us, came back saying the chef will make for us NOW?

THEN our orders came 5-10mins later. Then we noticed the people who came in later than us have handroll orders go to them first.

So is the system not working properly? Or did they forget our orders? Highly doubt I'll be going back again.

Not worth the wait at all. Highly NOT recommended"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWN5Z0hREAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"I'm totally disappointed with the service and regretted coming all the way just to have my first time experience with Sushi-GO yesterday. We reached there around 1:45pm, long queue found outside Sushi-GO and was told by one of the male staff that is the the queue to take queue number and need to wait around 3 - 4 hours to dine in after getting a queue number. I don't mind waiting for a few hours, by then it could be dinner time. I got my queue number at 1:57PM for queue number A276, there is still long queue behind me. I spent my time walking around,  went for movie etc. At 3:55PM, the queue number is only A052. ! came back at 6pm. I asked one of the female staff at the counter, the queue isn't really moving, what if we cannot dine in today? Can we get a compensation like a queue number for tomorrow? She answered, they didn't expect such an overwhelmed response. The queue started as early at 9AM this morning. There is no time limit for dine in so customers tend to eat slower, chit chat. They can't give me queue number for tomorrow as it is a first come first serve basis. I'm like? So you want me to come all the way here to try my luck AGAIN? I replied, by doing all these no one will want to even come back for such service. Long waiting time. Not getting dine in. No compensation. We overheard that the queue number got until 500ish till they stop taking in. At 9PM, we received a message from Sushi-GO that they are calling our queue. We can join Hungry Ghost Festival if we have waited till 9PM for our dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bG9MYkp3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Freshly made sushi served by cute robots in many expressions. A good variety of sushi at affordable prices. Very satisfied meal, will be back for more!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OHZDT0N3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Food - quality and taste was a 3⭐, as is typical sushi chain restaurants. The variety is quite a letdown. Many of the basic items are not available. The $1 opening promotion for sushi is only on 30 & 31 July.

The wait - ridiculously long waiting time of 1hour for a post-lunch timing and on a Monday. This is partly due to the closure of at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the restaurant and manpower shortage. Any other sushi chain doesn't make customers wait 1h.

Not elderly friendly - from the queueing system to the ordering system, the whole process aren't the friendliest and definitely not elderly friendly. There is no physical menu (except at the entrance) for elderlies to choose the sushi."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaEpTN0FnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"I believe this is the worst train sushi I had in my entire life. Nothing can be much worst than this. It's a total disappointment , waste of time n your stomach space.

The fried food was cold and bland. Sushi was way below average. Sushi go deserve 0 star. Whenever I need assistance, I need to walk to e counter n find staff for help.
And this one star is for floor staff Vicky. She is e one n only staff tat offer to help us clear e empty plate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ODdmSFZBEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,Everything is extremely slow. It took 30mins for my food to even start arriving after ordering. Half the time the food was served by servers. They even forgot some of my orders. I saw someone attempting to serve a plate to an empty table. Make sure to count your plates. There is a good chance you may have missed items.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NXNtOGtBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,Great place for families to enjoy sushi delivered to you by cutesy robots. Quite a novel and fun experience. Go for the thick cut sashimi - no regrets!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a1lUQ09REAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Extremely disappointed at the experience I had today, went there at around 2pm and was told by one staff that waiting time was about 3 to 4 hours and another that it was 4 to 5 hours. That seemed reasonable enough so I came back after 4 hours and asked for an update for how much longer it would take for my turn, the staff went to check at the computer and told me that it would be about an hour more. So I came back after another hour and this time I was told by another staff that it was likely that even if I waited till closing time, my turn to enter would not come.  I don't mind waiting for hours for the food but being told that it would take 4 to 5 hours and 1 hour more after I asked for an update, I would never have thought that I would not even be able to eat. In the first place, the management should have known that having this opening promo would bring about an overwhelming number of customers and should have set a maximum eating time like how genki sushi does it. I asked the staff why a maximum eating time was not imposed, the staff replied in a rhetoric manner asking me if I want a 30min time limit or a 1 hour time limit and told me they cannot control how long the people stay there to eat. I was also told that I should have estimated the waiting time myself, but I was already told by the staff that the waiting time was about 4 to 5 hours. Additionally, by 2pm the staff should have already been able to realise that they have given out too many queue numbers judging from the trends since opening in the morning and should have cut the queue number collection. My number was in the 200s for the 2 seater tables, and it was no where near my queue number near closing time, and to make it worse the last queue number is  almost 400. I am not sure how they estimated so badly the waiting time. The management was really awful and I am very disappointed.
To summarise:
1. not imposing a maximum eating time.
2. given an extremely wrong estimation of waiting time such that I was not even able to eat by the end of the day
3. not cutting off collection of queue number when it was very apparent that they had given too many queue numbers.
4. staff making it seem like it was my fault for not estimating the waiting time myself when they already told me that it would be about 4 to 5 hours

I would give 0 stars if I could, this is really unacceptable"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHViLWV3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,Waited for 45 mins for mediocre food and non-existent service. Sushi was overcharged and some of the orders didn't come. No apology given and no service recovery. First visit also my last visit.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnNPQ1pREAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"Quite innovative, serving by robots train. Even the entrance to table, ushered by robots too. Menu looks nice but not attractive to foods. Can be improved with more unique dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld1BLQXdRRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Waited so long for food, orders were messed up (people who came later than us got food first), and the food quality was just sad. Not a single food that was good. Haven't had such a bad meal in such a long time, not to mention one order was missed out (but by then it was more like thank goodness...). Sorry this is a no-go."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NTdpcXZ3RRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"its very bad. we waited for like 2hours just to get these tiny small bowls of noodles and rice worth like 5bucks. i mean it iS a sushi restaurant but like the waiting time was solong?!?! at first we entered we wanted buy rice and noodles but they were SOLD OUT. so we waited. LIEK AROUND AN HOUR. then finally after we ordered.. we waited AROUND WNOTHER HOUR. (might be highly exaggerated, but basically we arrived around 1130am then we left around 1pm+)  then the food come so less one ): right now we ate at mac donalds bcs our stomachs arent full😔

but the staff are attentive and served us well, its just the kitchens kinda slow. and i guess when u go to a sushi place, just get sushi👍 btw, food is kinda ehh average."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eFkySmxRRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,"Love every aspect of this place! The cute robots, the fun interior, and of course the yummy food (esp the thick cut sashimi). Plus points for keeping the kiddo entertained with the robots..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbllqeXVRRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,5,went last week and got a great service  Despite the peak hours was able to continuously help me with the countless refills of ginger and hot ocha.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NDRuYTdBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"A new outlet just opened. After submitting the order online, first shushi came abt 30 min later.   Sushies were nice and fresh. Price was reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1djZlUUZnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"There was lesser queue on a Wednesday 2pm. However, the varieties are seriously lacking. Many popular items were not available. Sushi was not even cold. That said it’s edible but the portioning alone didn’t even feel satisfying. Not just any rice & seaweed makes sushi.

Mentai Aburi salmon was barely torched and looked pathetic with the salmon wrapped around the rice. It was also overwhelmed by the amount of mentai sauce on top.

Kani salad gunkan looked fresh with the crispy looking seaweed but all the goodness ended there. Salad was warm and not even delicious. Just meh.

Sushi express had better standards. Feels like $1 promotion has caused them to cut corners leading to unsavoury  and warm sushi. Save your money for something better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ZzRfV0ZBEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"First had sushi-go at the Jurong Point outlet, it was pretty good and worth the price. When the AMK Hub outlet opened, the queue was superrrrr long and they close the queue as early as 7pm (on a weekday!!) Food doesn’t seem to be as good anymore, kitchen seems to be messy as a few of our orders were messed up (gave the wrong item, sent the same item twice, food did not come after awhile). Probably not worth the wait at the amk outlet 🥲"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld05PSWF3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"Omg I'm so shocked that all the food is so tasteless and super bad. Not expecting it until we ate it and I saw the review/rating and we waited for 1hr for it . Tako is rock hard and same for the fries. All the rice is so bland plus it keeps falling apart, the sashimi also gone case cause it's room temp and not fresh. By far the worst Japan restaurant ever. What ultimate sushi satisfaction? Yucks!!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajlIcjFBRRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,"No number to show that the food order is ready, no one wraps your food in a paper bag, no wasabi, soy sauce provided.  I have to asked a customer service to help me,He said that the chef in the kitchen was preparing, and let me wait there for nothing. and then I would ask the customer service to provide it. Poor service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Xy12V2RnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"Sushi go is seriously so underwhelming.. kinda expected more since there is so much hype previously. Price don’t justify the portions given, I would still go with either sushiro / genki over this"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aEpHekp3EAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,The service is very bad. My queue number was called but have to wait for 5+mins for me to enter.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGNma0JREAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,1,Takes a while for the food the come out. The plates are not clean. There was something stuck to my salmon sushi (not part of the dish). The food was subpar. 10/10 would NOT recommend.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bWNtbUZREAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,2,"While this is a Known concept for sushi chain. Compared to other sushi chains, the speed of getting our sushi is so so so slow. We waited 30mins and only 3 out of 12 plates ordered came."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjdyVG13RRAB,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,3,"Visited the amk hub branch for lunch at 1140am. Waiting time 20min for 2 ppl still reasonable. But food tasted a little meh. The rice didnt taste like japanese rice, not enough vinegar. The sushi that tasted best were those with lots of mentaiko sauce, enough to overpower the rice taste. Tea is powder instant tea which is also a little meh.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcTVYYmZnEAE,Sushi-GO @ AMK Hub,4,"was really skepticial of this place at first due to mixed reviews on google
so came here today and tried myself!
ordered vary dishes and i think it was ok! the ramen could be salty-er because it was no taste HAHAH. so added soya sauce myself
but the chawamusui (imo) beat genki when i love eggs myself
the chawamushi was full of taste & nice!
piping hot :)
salmon was nice too
price wise is u get what u paid for! like $5 for una tama don the portion not v big but ok to share ba!

but overall is good! can come back once in awhile to try :)
went during peak hours and service prompt

Upon seeing me with hands full of stuff today, she rushed up to me and helped me w my bags before ushering me to the cashier for my takeaways! She's so thoughtful even towards the end of service that she took a big pc plastic bag for me to put all my stuff in! I was literally blown away  and touched by her thoughtfulness, empathy and wonderful service!

Hope the organisation will have more staff like her as it's hard to come by nowadays.

Thank you Stephanie and keep up the good work ! Hope to see you soon again 😁"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNVByMkFREAE,Taiwanese Teppanyaki,4,"Located inside Foodfare @ AMK hub. It was just on the left side of the main entrance, you couldn’t miss it.
All the items were sold in set, no option for additional items, meaning there was a possibility, you could be ordering 3 sets for 2 pax.
Service was alright. The cooking was done fast.
The taste was full of pepper and a bit hard to enjoy the food’s original flavour.
Also the stall only accepted cash, no other mode of payment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMU03WHB3RRAB,Taiwanese Teppanyaki,1,"I was there on 28th June 2022 to try the new teppanyaki store that replaced express teppanyaki. It was dinner time and as usual crowded. I was seated behind the first counter and a few more customers came after me.  I do not expect any service as it's not fine dining. As I was waiting I noticed the cook (won't call him a chef cooking for the customers who came after me. The young boy noticed that I was not being served and told his colleague to cook mine as I came first. He told the young boy not to bother about me while he's cooking for other customers. I also noticed that instead of cooking based on sequence, he pick and choose which one he wants to cook first. I asked for a refund and the boy mending the cashier was nice enough to give me the refund. Having said this, of course I did not taste the food because I've already lost my appetite. Never experienced this when I dine with other teppanyaki stores."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbk11VFlnEAE,Taiwanese Teppanyaki,2,Since the new stall replaced the previous one we seldom eat here.. Too much pepper in the sauce.. unable to taste what we are eating.. standard not as good as the previous stall. Ingredients are also not as fresh..

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa2JpOEtBEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"Just had a couple side dishes here. The gyoza super nice, just the right amount of crispness. They are homemade according to the shop worker. The stir-fried mushrooms, wow. They got a little smoky flavor from the grill and if you're a mushroom lover you'll definitely want to get this. I don't even like onions but I ate all the onions in this too because they were cooked well and the sauce was very flavorful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNU5qOFNREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"The Tonkotsu Special was tasty and reasonably priced. The noodles were cooked al dente and had a nice bite soaking up the Tonkotsu broth nicely. The chashu was slightly thicker and tougher than I prefer, but still good. The Tonkotsu broth was rich and smooth yet not overly salty. The torched chicken drumstick had a nice sear. The meat was juicy and tender, coming off the bone easily. I got it as an add on, so I would recommend getting it as part of the clear chicken broth for the full experience. The pork gyoza were a tad pricey, but the filling was very fresh and not mushy, while the skin had a light crisp. It was fried on order and nicely done. Overall a satisfying meal. Recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNjd5UVpREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,Very hard to find coffee shop nestled under the HDB blocks. The ramen was prepared very quickly and it’s definitely value for money. I tried the all ingredients ramen bowl and the ramen was cooked al dente and the broth was really flavorful. Definitely worth a try! I would have given it a 4 stars if the coffee shop was in better shape.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbnZheU1nEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Visited this stall at AMK and gave their Tonkotsu Special Ramen a try. I really liked the soup, which was rich and thick, with a meaty milky flavour. Noodles were good, springy and had a nice chew to them. Their Chashu were neatly sliced and tender, which had a mild smoky flavour as well. The eggs were delicate with a silky texture. Overall, it was a competent bowl of ramen with a great value."

I had the ramen with chicken drumsticks. ⁣
In comparison to a typical Japanese restaurant, the ramen is slightly thicker. Chicken is incredible. You can simply tear it off with chopsticks since it is so soft. Clear chicken broth serves as the soup's foundation. It has a Chinese soup base flavor to it. Everything in this bowl is average. Will come back to try the tonkotsu ramen. ⁣

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcDZpR1p3EAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Visited with my family for the 1st time on a weekend.
Thoroughly enjoyed the food here, considering the price point the quality is really comparable to restaurants.
The gyoza is really the main star here, perfect meat to skin ratio.
Karage fried to perfection
For the tonkotsu broth, I find that it could be even more creamier.
The choice of ramen noodles wasn't what I expected. A thicker noodle would better complement the broth in my opinion.
Otherwise, really hope this place keeps being consistent in the standard of the food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ2ZpVkNBEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,"Knowing how much calories is in a bowl of ramen.. this is not quite worth my calories in my opinion. To be fair.. it's not bad.. but I won't say I like it. Soup base was average, noodles was average, everything was a tad average. Pricing wise it doesn't match ramen shops in the malls (which is the right thing to do)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb0x2Zm9nRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"We had the Tonkatsu Special and Chasu Tonkatsu. Decent ramen bowl that I wouldn't mind coming to eat again. While definitely not the best bowl of ramen you can get, but considering this is located in a neighbourhood kopitiam with kopitiam level price, I would say it is well worth the price for a restaurant level dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGRfdDJ3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"Chanced upon this on Google maps which is near my place. This ramen is restaurant standard, but just located in a coffeeshop. Even bowls and plates used are those you usually use in a restaurant.
Price point is for sure lower than those in restaurant, but the type of ramen variety seems to be only those few. They sell fried rice menu as well.

Broth is thick and good, I like it a lot. Chashu is slightly tasteless, but it's to my liking. Feels fatty and seems like will melt inside your mouth. Eggs are the runny kind as usual, and the seaweed or nori is super huge. They have black fungus as well. If they could add bamboo shoots I think that complements the taste.
Special mention goes to the gyoza. Steamed but fried on one side. It's juicy as well, so once you bite it, the juice oozes out.
Recommend if you are nearby 👍🏾"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOE9EMlFnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,"The total cost of all the items here cost $30, the noodles are $10 and $6, while the side cost $4-5. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is not because the noodles are bad. Oh no, the reason for this is because the gyoza is overcooked and from the photo, you can see for yourself.

How could the staff send out food like this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLVl5aGpnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Ordered the basic tonkotsu

Broth, a bit light on the pork flavor, but compensated with strong mushroom fragrance. I suppose to get a deeper flavor without being too greasy.

Char siu, nothing special, thin. A bit bland, a bit tough

Noodles, pretty good, thin-style, semi-firm; not overcooked.

Price: very affordable. $6.90 for tonkotsu, but they have a $5.90 chicken soup version available"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bVlDVm9BRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Chanced upon this while we were trying to visit a fried rice stall at the same coffeeshop during its rest day on Mon.

Really competent bowl of ramen at coffeeshop prices - chasu is flavourful and sliced to a good thickness, ajitama has perfect molten yolk and absorbed the soy sauce, tonkotsu broth and ramen are well executed. The spicy black oil was different from what I tried at some Japanese ramen restaurants, tasted a little bit like light curry broth.

Interesting to have more international influences coming into the coffeeshop scene."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHd3VqZ3d3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"2nd visit, this time remember to take picture before I stir. Lol.
Ordered their specialty again @10.80 which is good priced since it is in a coffeeshop (no point to pay high price at shopping malls just because of their high rental)
Different people has different preferences for ramen so I'll just share what I like about this.
Thumbs up for the texture of the noodles and the thick, favourable broth (those who love thick broth shld try)

Ramen lovers Should at least give it a try to see if you love it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM2NyS2xnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,2,"To be honest the broth does not taste authentic. It has this bitter taste and not refreshing or tasty.

But what surprised me is the teriyaki chicken ($5) is pretty good. The gyoza ($6) has this thick skin covering the meat inside. Worth a try too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybjhLYzh3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Found this on sethlui intro for AMK food. Must say the clear broth chicken drum stick ramen is unexpectedly nice! Meat literally comes off using my chopstick, so no fuss! I asked for less salty and yes you can ask for it on their menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aVlEdDd3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"This bowl at $6.90 is one of the cheapest good quality ramen I’ve tasted. It’s not overly salty like other ramen (if you like more salty you can let them know). The broth is not those super thick but thick enough to be flavourful. Tabao the gyoza home and it was very good too.

Highly recommended for its great price and qualify"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd2VxZnB3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Chicken that falls off the bone. Rich broth. Went with normal taste. Next time will try less taste. Finished the whole bowl, including the all the broth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMk1iSFVnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,Meat is slightly dryer but the soup & ramen is good. Love the gyōza.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajZlenl3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,1,"Priced way over the market rate for a coffeshop stall. Nothing outstanding about the food. Too expensive n yet stingy on the food ingredients. Order the special w extra ingredients but they gave the $4 cheaper version, had i not realised n asked, i'll definitely but short changed. Ramen soup had almost all been absorded by the noodles even before comsuming onsite. Noodle n soup has a bitter taste to it. Definitely NOT recommended to patronise. Better off w other better n value for money foodies at other stall in the same coffeshop.
My first 1 star review as imo, seriously this stall need a major revamp on its pricing/food quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcTdHZ1NREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,$8.30 for a bowl of char siew ranmen. .all OK except I find the photo and manual not so clear. Hope u can improve on the manual part. See until blur.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcWNqbFFREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"SHINJITSU RAMEN.332 Ang Mo Kio Ave 1. Happened to come across this place after sending my dog for grooming a few doors away. We ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. The soup base is very rich with creamy texture. Two large pieces of very lean chashu and the hosomen or thin noodles is firm and tasty. This is their cheapest ramen at $6.90 per bowl. I give it a score 8/10. Will come back to try the other dishes like pork gyozs , chicken teriyaki stick, etc."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc0pHdFpnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,"Average. Cha Shu is on the lacking side, pretty tough to chew. The rest are ok, not exactly cheap and affordable factoring quality. Compare to many local raman F&B which are just selling slightly more expensive but taste way better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcVpUNzNnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,"Good bits first; egg was lightly cured and still had a soft runny yolk. Chashu was lean but still tender. The nori sheet given was also quite sizeable(folded in half in pic)

Asides from these, the rest of the components were somewhat lackluster. Noodles and wood ear mushrooms were meh. Broth looked promisingly creamy but was salty and only had a hint of pork flavour. Considering that the majority of the price point of Ramen comes from the broth, 6.90+ isn't really justifiable with the quality that I've received. Maybe just get the basic ones and accessorize it with your own sides at home?

Definitely room for improvement."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cDhXN3pBRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,2,Their normal taste is too plain for my preference.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc0pQenVBRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"A decent ramen sold in a coffeeshop stall.

Soup: Decent

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN2ZfYm1nRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,1,"It really bad. The soup is not rich, creamy and salty. It just bad. Super bad. Cant finish"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbE9UWjV3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,2,"I'm really sorry but have to say quality is quite bad, broth tasteless, meat is hard. Got stomach-ache right after the food, terrible. Not worth the money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbmE3VDF3RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,"Great stall in a coffee shop to get your pocket-friendly ramen fix without going to the crowded malls. For its pricing, the ramen bowls sure have something going on, especially the soup base. Would visit again! 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHNyZktREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,One of the best hawker ramen. The mushroom plate is comparable to expensive japanese restaurants even though its half the price
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaW9YTnZBRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Discovered it after my haircut nearby. Quality was good but a tad pricey for coffee shop location. Compared to nearby stalls with average prices of $3 and up, the ramen special bowl is $10.90. But it was tasty and looked and tasted authentic. Onsen egg was good, a whole large piece of nori seaweed and generous 4 thick slices of chashu. I recommend. Worth a visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcllMRm53RRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,"Didn’t take photo, will do so next time and remember to ask for stronger tasting Ramen although the norm is already good enough. For $10.90, worthy dish to try though a tat expensive for coffeeshop setting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd09uVGtnRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,Great tasting ramen at coffeeshop price. Love the broth which is thick and yet not overly salty like most ramen soup. One of the better ramen stalls that is affordable and in a neighbourhood coffeeshop.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcXNTLUJnEAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,4,Taste wise ok for coffee shop price. But can't be compared to the usual Japanese Ramen shops. Conclusion: good for coffee shop standard.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaTdIXzhBRRAB,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,3,Ginger pork belly with onsen egg  taste average and cos $5.50 is definitely value for money!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2N2MtN0pREAE,Shinjitsu Ramen @ AMK,5,The pork gyoza is delicious and I can taste the juice comin out from the pork filling.   The quality can be compared to Japanese restaurants quality. 👍🏻

Not to mention you can use CDC voucher here so it’s definitely worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNF9qN2tRRRAB,Ramen King,5,"Hidden gem in an unassuming coffeeshop.

I had the Kurobuta Toroniku Ramen and Takoyaki. Portions were good and soup flavour was *chef's kiss*, not too overly salty (which is what you would usually find in other ramen stores) but at the same time very flavourful. The star of the ramen was definitely the meat, it melts in your mouth!

Will definitely be back again for more 😋"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnRfNGN3EAE,Ramen King,4,"Ordered char-siu spicy miso ramen at S$9.50.

The broth tasted good and the ramen texture was Q enough.  It was not spicy but was acceptable.  It would have been better if the char-siu was tender / succulent.

Both the staff were very friendly and have good customer service.

Will return for other ramen :)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cEs2TGV3EAE,Ramen King,4,"Soup makes the ramen overall taste good. However serving-wise not very 'King'-like. Little serving of soup for takeaway order, more like sauce, half the ramen showing above the broth. Half an ajitama egg non-marinated, no flavor if consumed without soup. 2-small slices chasu, taste pretty good. The good tasting broth saved the dish overall. (Edit: Ordered Tonkotsu Ramen)"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMWF1VGVREAE,Maki-San (AMK Hub),1,Absolute garbage. Tried it before 2 years ago and it was pretty good. This time I thought to order the bowl. Paid 18 dollars for it because I decided to add extra unagi and beef (sold as roasted striploin). Food is just microwaved meat on iceberg lettuce. (Picture is as delivered)
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPc19UaHNRRRAB,Maki-San (AMK Hub),2,"Before ordering, I was wondering why this outlet had 2 stars, I thought it was maybe due to service so I just proceeded to order. But after eating, I now understand it’s actually the food standards. I always eat Makisan but this outlet’s sushi standards r pretty bad.. the sushi rice was like old stale rice n wasn’t pleasant and all the fried things i got such as the fried tempura enoki and baby potato chips were all soggy n not crispy etc. The sushi was also a mess everyt was falling apart :( Just a feedback for improvement! :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dG9hd2JREAE,Maki-San (AMK Hub),2,"We tried Maki-san from the Junction 8 store last year and it was better. We ordered Grab delivery from this store in the recent weeks and it seems that either the quality has dropped, or this store does not have the same standards as the Junction 8 store:

1) the rice was not up to standards and mushy.
2) the fried items were so hard that they might be leftovers from the previous day, and they just heated it up either by re-frying or using the microwave.
3) some of the non-fried food items might have gone slightly bad (because there is a smell).

We have forgotten to leave a review on Grab though.

Also, do note that the amount might be smaller than you expect."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWVIaWRnEAE,HHJ Japanese & Korean Kitchen,1,Way below average food serve here. Worse than my medicore cooking. Pictures speak a thousand words so i straightforward. Hot plate korean chicken is bland. Hotplate egg pork katsu overcooked. Miso soup like lukewarm hot. Saving grace for the one star is the rice. My bad for not reading review as i assume their standard will be consistent across their franchise outlet but my complacent has caused a very unhappy dinner on a weekend.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eU9UVWpRRRAB,HHJ Japanese & Korean Kitchen,1,"absolutely worst “kimchi” fried rice, absolutely tasteless and even mushy.  pure rubbish, should have checked out the reviews before buying food from here."

Fish & prawn is surprisingly fresh 👍 I love their pork, coz it's sliced to the best size and when u grill it'll be a bit crunchy.
Their Tomyum soup is not too spicy which I like."

Very good to satisfy cravings for Thai food in the neighborhood. The atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable. Thailand's standards, make me feel like I’m in Bangkok. Boss Kathon very smiley and friendly person who always makes happy to each customer. TKS"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMi1qeVl3EAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,5,"I have so many good things to say about this place. Went there for ala carte buffet dinner with my family of 4. To be honest, we did not have high hopes and we were not expecting us to order more than 2 rounds of food. But each dish that came, we finished it immediately. Portion size was just nice for 4 of us. We ended up ordering 4 rounds of food, a total of 11 or 12 dishes excluding desserts!! Durian sticky rice is a MUST order!!

All in all, the food here way surpassed our expectations. The chefs cook the dishes upon ordering. Will definitely recommend all to dine in here at least once.

Only thing is that the location is quite a “birds dont lay eggs place” 😆"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydDZIYWh3RRAB,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,1,"The most annoying thing is the food take more than 30 min to serve us. And the durian sticky rice we ordered 2 but only come 1. We need to keep remind the staff which dish not served yet. Taste wise also not as great as described on social media.
Not near to mrt nor bus stop.
Definitely won't come back anymore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLTl6eUVREAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,5,Very good food and reasonable price. High ceiling for indoor seatings. Service good too. Alfreso dinning.  Mask off!!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ09QVTZ3RRAB,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,1,"Reached at 8pm for our buffet, waited for almost 40min for the first snacks to be served. Chicken cutlet was served FROZEN. After almost 2 hours of waiting and they informed that they were closing, we decided to just forget about those dishes that weren't served yet.
The waiting time super SUPER long (we met a group of friends who were there at 6pm and by 9 they still got couple of dishes tat werent out yet), to make things worst, the pork and mussles weren't even fresh.
Drinks were not included in the buffet price so their strategy could be to drag time and make you order rounds and rounds of drinks and they won't even serve you all the dishes you ordered.
Absolute waste of time, you can get better tasting food at most hawker or Thai restaurants, we ended up paying $45 per pax and got full on drinking water."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzd1MFBREAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,2,"Had to wait for very long because our order was apparently cancelled and the waiter did not inform us beforehand, instead she watched and did not say anything. We later on went on to ask and she only told us then, I felt that the customer service was bad because of the lady. Food overall was good tho. We came at 6 and received our first dish at 7+"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeWNYLUxREAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,1,"Dinner was open 6-9 for this restaurant. We came in at 6pm for their buffet and orders were sent at 6.10. waited till 7.45pm for our food not to be served yet. There was a table beside that made a scene for their food not served and they got theirs served when they were clearly at least 30min later than us to arrive. Did not want to cause a scene and left after paying for what we ordered based on ala-carte pricing.

Clearly a NEVER come again. Unless you have a great patience to wait 2hrs for your food to arrive when having a buffet. It was just a pure terrible experience"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyeVptMjFRRRAB,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,1,"Saw their Ala-Carte Buffet on Facebook and me and my family wanted to try. When we reached the restaurant we were told that it was full so we were sitted at the outdoor area, there are oil smoke coming out of the top of the building every 10 mins, and we got choked multiple times by it. We came at about 6pm and waited till 7pm and there is only chilli sauce on the table, we were served the fried squid, but we believe that it belongs to the other table beside us. We continue waited until about 7.30pm and i start to have gastric. And there are still no food on our table. Ended up we gave up and went off. Totally wasted all my family time for coming down. We kept asking for the food but the waiter kept pushing to us that they are short handed and there is also a lot of table waiting before us. Understand that, but if you are unable to handle this much customers then you should not have accept this many customers and even offer ala-carte buffet. And also, since you have advertisements on facebook, you should expect more customers coming right? This is my worst dining experience ever. Totally BLACKLISTED, come at your own risk. 😡"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOEttd19nRRAB,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,5,"A wide variety of dishes. We ordered garlic pork, honey chicken, deep fried sweet and sour fish, fried enoki, deep fried squid, green curry, phad Thai, broccoli. Portion is huge, price is reasonable, food is delicious. Phad Thai and green curry are my favs. Its not crowded as well. A rare gem indeed! Will definitely be back for more… Boss is friendly and service is great too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z3N2d2VBEAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,1,"one of the worst buffet ever.

2 paying adults can only order 1 x scoop of ice cream and prawn/crayfish.

Stingy af policy, most of the items on the menu comes with rice or noodles that is served compulsory.

Order takes long to come and staff needs many reminder to get it right.

1/10 star would not try again."

For the very reasonable price, the mookata was great (particularly enjoyed the garlic chicken n beef)! The place was bright n airy, with more than adequate safe distancing between tables. The extremely high level of hygiene was also a huge plus for me - hot plate looked pristine, table was wrapped with a sheet before food was served, kitchen looked spick n span. Service was warm n friendly too. 10/10 would visit again!

Understand that patronage has dipped recently due to the surge in omicron in the community. Do support them! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ck0yN3RnRRAB,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,5,"Forgot to take picture of food but I'm posting the photo instead.

Three things I would like to talk about

1. Food and price

The food they served was fresh and delicious, especially their corn and marinated beef! Their bomb is the signature sauce, superb! I'll rank it my top three favourite sauce. My friends and I were praising the signature sauce profusely! Another innovation of them is to use butter to grill the meat, it was super delicious! Total price we paid after 10% discount was $52 for 4 pax. That's super worthy and even without 10%, it's still under $15 with your stomach full!

2. Cleanliness

Normally mookata place will be very dirty and unhygienic and oily, but they're otherwise, the whole environment is clean and not oily at all, table don't have any dirt or leftover food. Which we all were very pleased with.

3. Staff

Staff was super friendly and attentive, despite they have to attend to other customers, they will drop by to ask how's the food and if there's any assistance needed, and also offered to take picture for us. I will rate the service 10 stars if Google allows.

Even though the location can be very ulu, but it's really worth your time to walk in and try their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHFTcktBEAE,Lark Lark Mookata - GARDEN by the BEER,4,"The Thai Sea Bass was tastefully done, so does the mookata. But room for improvement is that they could ensure the fire of the Sea Bass and mookata was bigger, because the soup and gravy did not boiled at all..."

Service is good. Eric & team are friendly and very easy going.

Price : $28.80 for a meat platter for 2.

Food quality : fresh and big serving of meat. We had to push each other to finish them

Location : a lil isolated. But if u drive, it’s easy to find parking spots and it’s free. I think there are buses on the main road. Not too far in to walk"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycGREUzRnRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,We were here for the vet's appt and was so glad for a cafe that welcomes little friends. Better than that the food is very good. The pasta was fresh yet light. We also had the croffles with a very crispy chicken. I would have stayed longer for dessert but with the current humidity we have to come back when we can sit indoors without the little friend. Very good dining experience and good offering of wines too!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMDY2WnN3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a weekday for brunch, was a nice and quiet place to chill. Really enjoyed the pasta, which is a recommended dish . Quite a decent amount of seafood (scallops, prawns, clams) given 👍🏼👍🏼"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMHVPSlBnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,A nice cafe tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Consists of both indoor air conditioned and outdoor seating suitable for pet owners which is a plus. Ample seating space inside as the restaurant stretches quite far in. Service is good and relatively fast. Decor is pretty and they have interesting pieces of furniture and contrasting wallpapers and panels for a varied effect. Tried their speculoos latte and Peter’s Pancake which is quite good 👍😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPME1heGRBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Pretty good food and service at reasonable prices. The rosti waffles were very delicious, although we wish they could be even crispier. Pancakes are fluffy, scrambled egg is creamy, bacon is not too greasy. The melon tea smells very calming although the melon taste itself wasn't very strong. The online ordering platform was missing photos for several items, which made it hard to visualize what the dish would look like or the portion size.

Relaxing simple decor. The outdoor area is pet-friendly, lotsa cute dogs there! Indoors has plenty of seating. There is also a small garden area on the other end, with goldfishes swimming around in a little rock fountain."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnZxRzVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"Wow.. love this place for its space... wide spacious and hippy green ambience... Nice!

Simply the space and deco makes this cafe super comfortable to laze and chill in.

And I'm glad the great food goes well with ambience too..

Been here twice already. And their pastas and burger is great!

And their online loyalty program is definitely tempting me to go back a 3rd 4th time...
And its only tempting because food and ambience is great..

Would definitely be back many more times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3UzRUpBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Found a nice new cafe. Great food, pet friendly and can cycle over the next round. Just a bit longer waiting time for a seat so better to book advance 🥂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMTlyQ21RRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"My first attempt lunch experience.

Personally, I like their main menu items, the savoury items are not to my liking.

Overall dining experience is good. Nice place and ambient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyekxpSkxnEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Strong contender to the existing upper Thomson road cafes like Columbus Coffee. Overall good brunch food, with nice platting and interior design. However could do better with their coffees (quite awful Americano). They should like consider providing better utensils (fork,soon) as the current ones are obviously of sub standard quality, similar to the ones we see in food court. It’s the non polished type and didn’t look or feel sparkling clean. Furthermore, all of their fork has stains between the grooves. Asked for change but all had stains. Ended up not using their fork. Lost my appetite a little. Chicken was great but wished they drained the excess oil before serving. The plate was filled with excess oil from the chicken midway during meal. Overall 3 stars with lots of potential for improvement."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb1ozQkRBEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Good food and pet friendly. Will visit again
Not bad for a 3 week old cafe 🙂

Update:
Went back on their 4th week of business with more friends. Waiting time improved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbGFxeXhRRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"A bright, beautiful, and spacious cafe with lots of greenery - reminds me of a laidback Balinese beach club/cafe. It has a open, pet-friendly outdoor seating area too!

Not your usual cafe fare, ordered a few unique items to try. They were all delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzhHM0hREAE,Cava Singapore,3,"This cafe is pretty near my place but first time trying. Reservations is recommended especially for weekends. Surprised that the indoor dining area was so big.
Found the price of the food quite expensive. Breakfast for 3 easily exceeded $100. They had a promo with Citibank but we had lots of problems with it as it couldn't accept applepay or if the credit card is stored inside the phone without the full 16 digits.
Order a few dishes to share, the one we enjoyed most is the Chicken and Croffles. Both croffles and chicken were well cooked. The Roffles platter was interesting because of the rosti waffles and also liked the way the mushrooms were cooked.
Service was very slow. Not sure if they forgot the order or what. The staff are all very young and had to call them over a few times to check the status of the dishes. The sides came almost last, the Spicy Chicken wasn't really nice it didn't taste Korean but the sauce more tasted like the Thai sweet Chili sauce. The Sakura Cream Tagliatelie also came late and serving was very small which left us unsatisfied.
Drinks were just pretty average.
Really need to improve on the speed of the food served. Not sure why the cafe wasn't even crowded at all early in the morning."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N0tDckJ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Lovely ambience and tasty albeit junky food, has a nice al fresco area for pet owners and their fur kids. Deep fried chicken and croffles very yummy. Fries were good too. We'll be back soon."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b0lxNmlBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Loved the interior design and spacious. Also has an outdoor sheltered seating area. Our group of 3 had the croffles with fried chicken, the crispy chicken burger, the rosti with mushrooms & pork sausages, chicken tenders with korean spicy sauce - all of them were decently good. The letdown came in the form of their tarts where the crust was soft, and it just felt liked it was kept for too many days."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGFMT2JREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Visited the place on a weekday afternoon and was delighted that there’s no crowd. Huge space with ample seating area. Had the fried chicken, sakura pasta and the creamed corn (CCB).

The pasta and chicken were great but the corn was just alright. The sour cream was not a good addition to the corn. Drinks were on the expensive side too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM0lXVzNRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Didn't expect the food to be good, but it really is! The chef does fried chicken super well. We ordered the spicy Korean fried chicken it was out of this world. The CCB is also super yummy. The CAVA burger is huge but also very tasty. My husband and I were stuffed after these three dishes due to the generous portion of the CAVA burger. For the portion, the price is very reasonable. The downside is the waiting time, it took 40 mins for us to have the first side on the table. We had to approach the service staff to check on our order. The last dish, the burger took 1 hour. Service staff is quite friendly and attentive in terms of refilling water. Easy to get their attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc0tLQ1R3EAE,Cava Singapore,2,"The colors they utilized in their interior design were fantastic. The colors are black, white, and jade green. This is a fantastic mix. I went on a Friday night when it wasn't too packed. ⁣

Dinner menu is so-so, portion can be bigger even though the food is good. Love the place as it allowed furkid to accompany the hoomans under shelter. Nice cafe in a quiet estate."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnNmR2pnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"May 2022: This cafe has really good potential. Love the space - bright and spacious. Food was also good. Order the Cava Burger (chicken thigh) and the wild mushroom pasta. Both delicious. I liked how the cheese was melted on the bun and the mushrooms in the chicken burger. There is an option to choose wagyu meat instead of chicken for $2 additional but I read about how good the fried chicken was and hence was not about to lose this opportunity to taste it! Was happy I didn’t! Anyway, I wonder how the burger which included a slice of pineapple would taste if I had chose wagyu!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1B1SmZnEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"5 stars service, staff very patient and polite. They have special food and drink. Delicious and satisfying. The pet friendly zone is spacious without worrying about rain or hot weather."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaUw3WUxBEAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Love the recommended dishes : Sakura Tagliatelle, Cava Burger. Food is really good, best part I can get to see beautiful fur patrons playing at the outdoor area. Didn't enjoy the lemon meringue tart though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a09EVUZ3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great neighbourhood cafe with brunch food. Rather big space lots of seating outside and inside. We ordered the fried chicken and croffles, mentaiko fries and the mushroom risotto.

The fried chicken was really well battered, light and crispy and not oily. The coleslaw was also a really nice touch cause I’m not a fan of putting maple syrup on my savoury food. I would say a must try when you come here.

The mushroom risotto was everything you would want in a risotto dish. Simple and rice was cooked just right (slightly Al dente but cooked through).

Mentaiko fries were decent but nothing special.

You order and pay through a QR code which is always a plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldDhUbDZBRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"We came here after seeing Daniel Food Diary’s review (though we know to take all the bloggers’ reviews with a big pinch of salt).

In a nutshell, the food here is decent. Just skip the desserts and the coffee (which is a collaboration with local Hook coffee but the cafe does not have a barista in house). After lunch, simply hop over to Thus Coffee which is just around the corner.

It’s nice, quiet and spacious spot for catching up over lunch. On a Monday noon, it wasn’t crowded at all. We had a nice far end spot where behind the doors is the backyard with a water well.

We ordered the otah bruschetta (sourdough), seafood aglio olio, fishy business (salmon), roffles platter and wild mushroom risotto. All of us rather enjoyed our respective main course.

Thereafter, we shared the ondeh ondeh cake, yuzu cheesecake and a warm apple crumble and also had cups of coffee.

The Apple crumble looked really funky and unnatural (take a look at the last photo) plus it was too sweet. The ondeh ondeh was nothing to rave about either. Coffee was served without inspiration (no latte art cos as mentioned, no barista) - it was just bland, normal coffee but at a barista price tag of $7."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNThPX3lnRRAB,Cava Singapore,3,"Do reserve before going especially on a weekend as it can get packed.

First visit - Order didn't go through the online ordering system and we ended up waiting for awhile to realise it didn't go through. But technical fault, can't be helped. Anyway, reordered and our food came in adequate time. The spinach cream pasta was quite nice.

Second visit - Decided to try the otah, and sakura pasta. Interesting menu, both were alright.

In both visits, the drinks were slightly underwhelming. Nice atmosphere and staff though!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb19iNUFREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Went there for lunch recently for a family of 5. Overall food is nice and the service is good. However, and that is a HUGE but, the waiting time for the food is ridiculously long at 70 minutes after ordering!!

They did let us know that waiting time for food will be at 30 minutes or more. I think it is good that they let customers know that they need to wait. Hmm... but we waited for 70 minutes... AND even if there is lots of pre-warning or notification that food may take some time to prepare, waiting for 70 minutes for the food is not acceptable. They really need to look into streamlining the process or expanding the kitchen capacity to have faster turn around time.

Apart from that, please do make reservation ahead! With such a long turn around time from ordering food to serving, you don't want to be queueing outside waiting for table + waiting for food later!

The service of this place is good. There are many attentive young servers.

Food wise, it is tasty and unique. Some notable dishes are the Spinach Creatm Tagliatelle ($15), Seafood Aglio Olio ($15),  CCB (Cream Corn Bacon $9). We ordered quite a lot of other stuff too. Can look at the photos. Food wise, it is 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNXRDYmVnEAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Beautiful interior and very spacious, quiet on thurs evening. Food was veryyyy average. Melon tea by the pot, teabag type. Speculoos Cafe Latte was good because its totally not sweet at all though the name. Roffles Platter was very homemade... the roffles was not crispy and abit mushy. Sakura Cream Tagliatelle Pasta was below average, too much residue water from the seafood so the whole dish was very watery but the prawns were fresh. Seafood Aglio Olio was average. Fries with truffle & parmesan was good, very generous and huge serving, highly recommend. Visited this cafe to celebrate a friend's birthday so we also ordered a Lemon Meringue Tart which didnt taste fresh, below average.

Will recommend this place only for small bites and drinks. Good for a teatime break."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaU9XbERREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Great all-day brunch and coffee. I had the open faced wagyu sandwich and my wife tried the Rosti waffle platter which is gluten free. Both are well presented and tasty. It is cavernous inside with lots of space and good ambience. Pets are allowed in their outdoor seating, which is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0tpcnVBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,A really spacious cafe newly opened just months ago. Comfortable and cosy seating.. serving great pasta towards the Asian texture. Love❤️ the small portions available for the small eaters🥰 #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcC1lQUhBEAE,Cava Singapore,3,"Was looking for coffee after dinner and stumbled upon this cafe. Big and spacious dinning area. There is also a huge alfresco dinning area where you can bring your pets along. Very comfortable environment. At around 9+pm was still quite crowded on a Friday nite.

Cafe pricing is on the pricier side for this order. Drinks are quite unique. Ordered the iced puffed rice cafe latte and a hot speculoos cafe latte.

Puffed rice went quite well with the latte adding some texture. Giving a cereal feel when it is soaked up with latte. Recommended to try. Speculoos latte is ok but hope that they can be more generous with the speculoos topping.
Cheesecake is average.

Nice place to chill after dinner. Will be back to try their food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnRLekl3EAE,Cava Singapore,4,Came with hubby and kids on Sunday late afternoon . Kids and pets friendly . Quite a busy cafe at that hour so I think quite suitable for noisy kids to dine in . Ambience was great as I faced to a small tropical garden ! Love the plants especially for plant lovers . haha . I think chicken croffle was not bad-recommended . English BF and spam fries soso. Cappucino can be better ( quite bitter ) as I think the other cafe around the corner has better coffee . I was expecting better coffee
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ2ZiYnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Great ambience, nice deco plus 5 stars for presentation! Melted nacho cheese dripped over the entire Wagyu burger served with fries. Lovely idea. Was expected a patty but it was yakiniku Wagyu but I'm not complaining cos it was well done. Impressive. Just didn't like that fries served was only warm, likely fried and put aside for quite a while. Waffle and chicken wasn't that fantastic according to my lunch companion. But still, decent for sure. Wash it all down with a pint for a wonderful dining experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDc2NkZREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Celebrated Father’s Day here. Coming here to try the food because it’s recommended by danielfooddiary. The food is fantastic. We tried the otah bread, ice latte, croffle chicken & seafood pasta. Price wise is $20 ish per pax. Ambience is good too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNFoyUnlnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,Pet friendly cafe in a quiet neighborhood. Quality of food is better than expected but selection range not wide- wish they have more desserts choices~
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaUxDWlNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Had the mushroom linguine, mentaiko fries and spinach pasta. Enjoyed all of them. Portion size was good, mentaiko was very flavourful and had a torched flavour. Mushroom linguine had a generous amount of mushrooms and they were cooked well without too much of an earthy taste.

Could improve the acoustics in the restaurant though as there were not many people but it was very noisy. Good place to hold events but if it's so echoey it will not be conducive.

Do check out the well. It had a few dead leaves though. And the door to the back garden was locked.

Also there was a super smiley server, she was really cheerful, wish all servers were like her."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM09qcXRRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Good cafe, good choice of items/menu and friendly staff. Prices very acceptable for this area as well. We had the chicken croffles and the otah bruschetta, both tasted really good. Don't know what it is, but it's just missing the x-factor for a five star review."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM1BiRWRREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Food is ok and environment is good. Nice outdoor place for people who wants to bring their pets over to chill.

This places serves western food. Can get pretty crowded and noisy during dinner times.

A little far from MRT, but this place is worth the distance.

Will definitely come back here for more next time!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLU5ycUNREAE,Cava Singapore,5,"Food is very yummy, and place is very bright and roomy. The croffle and chicken was a big hit with everyone, and I loved the chicken burger as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX3NHTjFBRRAB,Cava Singapore,5,"C.C.B was my favourite dish! Head down to the cafe to find out what I mean 😉

Attracted to the amazing ambience of this cafe! I highly recommend all of you to have a sense of it too!

- Food; EXCELLENT!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️ The food display was exquisite, the food taste just as pleasant as how it looks (I took video instead of photos, cant post it)

- Chill outdoor; can bring your pet along, I saw one doggo 😍 (it’s open 24/7 according to one of the bosses)

- Cozy indoor; the furnishing of the cafe felt like I was in a HIGH END restaurant with affordable food, there are high chairs, sofas, and other different types of sitting to choose from (closes at 10-10.30pm)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdjZMYmdnRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Location: Pet friendly cafe located near a vet, a small park, catsmart, petlovers, and a nearby cafe to chill with your pooches after having a walk at lower pierce reservoir, ample parking.

Cafe: Came here a few times. Cafe is very spacious for small and big groups but price wise is a bit on the high side. I find a cup of cappuccino at $7 quite exp. Got the caramelized (coffee with a whip of caramel at $8). Food is acceptable & bug portion but not so fantastic. Service is very good, staff will immediately ask a choice of cold or warm water, and provide a water for the pooch too. We'll come back for small bites and some drinks."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldWNiVnZRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Interesting place to dine at a hidden corner. It has a “secret” garden that’s quite cool too with mist timing. Food is nice and ambiance is cosy, clean and spacious. 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHB1SXVRRRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"The cafe is very Instagramable , it’s nice for chill out n photo n meeting up with friends , beer r very affordable price .
Owners r friendly couple
Chicken is too small portion size can be improved, maybe add more vege to make it feel more worth it , we prefer smth that is bigger portion. Coffee is a little bitter , can be improved.
The English breakfast cauliflower is not really fantastic, it will be better if u can change it to mash potatoes or sweet corn or potatoes salad . The bread is too thin n small it will be better if u guys can change to a thicker one . Taste wise is perfect . Like a 4 star restaurant. Thumbs up owner ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNkxLS0RREAE,Cava Singapore,4,"Nice and spacious cafe in the quiet Sembawang Hills with friendly staff. Seems to be pet-friendly with many customers with dogs out front.

Had typical cafe food with some interesting twists e.g. Nacho Cheese on Wagyu Burger, Rose Matcha Latte. However feels slightly pricy, even for a cafe, (~$20), especially if you order cmmon cafe food

Would recommend to try if you're in the area, and get the more special foods on the menu (like Otah Bruschetta) instead of things like the typical American Breakfast set."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMGRLZFR3EAE,Cava Singapore,5,Spacious restaurant with a modern deco. Attentive and prompt service. Good food.with little pleasant surprises.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWU2WVpBEAE,Cava Singapore,2,"Pet-friendly place. I wouldn’t say it’s fantastic or novel but I tried it because of the good reviews. The otah bruschetta was thin and laid on top of a slice white bread. It’s quite hard to cut and dry. In terms of spiciness and taste, I’ll rate it 2/5. In the end, i grab it with my hands and eat it. I don’t think it’ll order it again because it’s not worth $18 (add $2 for cheese topping). Coffee is so-so ($7 up)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajdiT3l3RRAB,Cava Singapore,4,"Went on a Thursday evening and the space was quiet and serene! A lot of space between tables which made it a plus for an already dog friendly establishment. Service staff were attentive and responsive. Ordered three mains: Sakura ebi tagliatelle, seafood aglio olio and a small breakfast plate, found them all to be nice! Hot latte was also good! But apple crumble was very disappointing cos it was soft and mushy, hence minus one star!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXZxWmtBRRAB,The Makan Place@AMK,4,This is a halal cafe which serves western food. The set up is simple and prices are reasonable for the portions. I had the chicken cutlet with pepper sauce on a hot plate. It was served with a good portion of mashed potato which had the sauce in an indentation in the middle. Nice presentation.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbV9TNTRRRRAB,The Makan Place@AMK,5,"This place sits where Ren² chicken rice used to be. A hidden gem. Acceptable portions at affordable prices. My personal favourite is the black pepper pasta. If you're looking for the 'atas' fare, maybe go elsewhere. Food is served up expeditiously and whilst hot and steamy!
Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eWVHTVJ3EAE,The Makan Place@AMK,5,lamb chop was delicious and staff are friendly. only nit is the hot grill plate has ridges which makes cutting the lamb chop difficult. also the lamb chop gets overcooked on the grill plate. plus side of it is your food stays hot longer. perhaps have a tiny discount (something like 20-50cents discount) for customers who opt for a less premium normal plate. that may entice customers who want a no frills chop/steak for good price to order the chops/steaks.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2c29xaldREAE,The Makan Place@AMK,5,"Excellent service and affordable place to eat . Staff was very polite and explains to us regards the Halal certificate. Food was great , taste like the high class restaurant. Highly recommend place to dine in.  I will come back again to try out the rest of the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5a3BUSkRBEAE,The Makan Place@AMK,5,"Spring chicken was very good, my children and my favourite. The skin is crispy and meat is juicy... like the fresh vege at the side. Tried a few times and the consistency is there.
Sunday night crowd comes in around 630pm... Good to come slightly earlier if there's young kids to feed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldE5ieFJREAE,The Makan Place@AMK,1,"1 Star - Lots of Fries🤔
Very disappointing when being given 2 halves of 2 different proportion sizes half spring chicken when I ordered 1 whole spring chicken😔
Gave me a dry out half spring chicken🙄
If there's no whole spring chicken, then remove from your menu. Offer buy 2 halves with $3 off🤔
Still have to pay extra 30¢ for your advertisement box🧐"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMUtiM1pREAE,The Makan Place@AMK,3,"Food is above average. beverages could be improved as the drinks we ordered were all too ""light"" in taste. Milk tea came out really looking like milk, very mild taste of tea. Calamansi ...same issue...mild taste of calamansi.
Fries both the original and sweet potato is good, home style as all the small bits and pieces are served to you, no waste!
For their food prices, just about right as they operate as a standalone cafe"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdkxUendBRRAB,The Makan Place@AMK,5,"Homely family business that serves up amazing food. Uncle mentioned that they only use fresh chicken and coconut for their curry chicken. Definitely could taste the difference. Opens during CNY, will come back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE1uYzlRRRAB,The Makan Place@AMK,4,"Had the spring chicken and chicken cutlet with rice. Price quite reasonable though on the tad high which can be understood due to business expenses
Will visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMTlXRnZ3RRAB,The Makan Place@AMK,3,"Been here a few times. Go for their curry chicken (enough to share for 2 small eater), salad (well balanced texture and taste; good for sharing between 2 to 4) and their fried rice and spaghetti / noodles dishes. Give their burger a miss (chicken one was made of minced meat patty that is mushy and taste bad; It would be better if the meat is the chicken chop or cutlet type)."

They have recently come up with a new dish ""Tom Yam Pasta"" and it's delicious. The chicken satay is absolutely tasty and tender, satay sauce is perfect. Not forgetting the Root Beer float 🍺 , which is my all times favourite drink. The staffs are nice and friendly, it makes you relax and your meals enjoyable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5LUp5OU93EAE,The Makan Place@AMK,2,"I was quite excited to try this new Western food shop. However, I was fairly disappointed. The food was pretty tasteless.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyak9tTVVnEAE,Vincent Western Food,4,"We were there on a Saturday at about 7pm. There was a short but constant queue. Order was fast and wait time reasonable.

We ordered the Hot Plate Combo Grill, which has beef, pork, chicken, bacon, sausage, coslaw, egg and fries. Fries and pork were quite good and the rest were pretty normal. But for $10, there is really nothing to complain."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdVBtUVhBEAE,Vincent Western Food,3,"I m not sure what the hype is all about. There seems to be always a queue. I ordered the chicken chop and it comes with a small portion of chicken. Taste is normal. Old school condiments eg. French fries,coleslaw, baked beans and a tiny leaf of lettuce. At $6 is about on the low side but with smaller portions, that is about right pricing. Overall can eat if around this area and feel the urge."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1amNieV9RRRAB,Vincent Western Food,3,"This western stall has a 古早味to their food. It’s like old style western food they served back in the days. The chicken chop and gravy was quite tasty. Coleslaw was quite nice too…it had pineapple gave quite a good flavor I think. The queue is very long for weekend dinner times though. I waited for over 30min. Not sure if it is really worth queuing up for, but worth a try if the crowd is not too bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLamFLZ0RBEAE,Vincent Western Food,3,"Ordered takeaway. I like how they give a buzzer even for takeaways.

I got their chicken wing rice. The chicken wings were good. Well marinated without being overly salty. It comes with a sunny side up egg and coleslaw as well. I have to say their rice portion is quite big. But the disappointing thing is that the rice served is just plain rice. I was kind of expecting it to be have some flavour because there are some stalls which offer chicken wings with flavoured rice like those you get from chicken rice stalls. But overall worth the value."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MjUyYkZ3EAE,Vincent Western Food,4,"Meat quality & taste of beef, chicken and pork is good. But their combi grill is extremely not value for money :( - makes u pay more for 3 small cuts of meat which I personally feel adds up to less meat than if u just order regular chicken/pork chop…"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNnRlbmt3RRAB,Vincent Western Food,5,"Finally I decided to queue for this, pretty amazing as the queue is long but the system is good.  I got my food in a short time.  The friendly aunty that took the order is very organized.

I have ordered pok chops and chicken cutlet for my girl.  Well the pork chop meat is thin  but I felt is enough for us.

My girl said is delicious and couldn't finished hers.

For a 6 sgd chicken chop
And a 6.50 pork chop
Portion is decent huge.
Recommended."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dlk2UWZ3EAE,Vincent Western Food,4,"This old school western food stall located in AMK Central Market, has been around for years. They sell affordable old fashioned western food like chicken cutlet, fish & chips, mixed grill with sides baked beans, fries and salad.

Their mains are served in generous huge portion, covering almost half the size of the plate, which you can see from the pictures. Fried with a crispy outer layer, the meat within is thick and filling too. It brings back wonderful childhood memories of myself, eating plates of oversized chicken cutlet with same cheap side dishes like canned beans and coleslaw.

Their food is wallet friendly and definitely worth the try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcGRIekVBEAE,Vincent Western Food,4,"Chicken cutlet $6, was tender and juicy. Well fried with a crispy crust. Sides were standard western fare."

Hilarious to hear the lady boss keep barking orde to the cook (husband?) haha. Will definitely go again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTcGRtei1RRRAB,Vincent Western Food,5,Takeaway the famous pork chop AND LOOK at the value for money omgosh it was 2 big pieces of pork chop and sides for $6.50. cheaper than Aston's !! It was still nice even though dabao a bit cooled down
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNlBTS293RRAB,Vincent Western Food,3,Went around 8pm on a sat and still had a slight queue but didn't have to wait long. Good plate of old school western food. Nothing special though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHai1yeGpBRRAB,Vincent Western Food,5,"Hands down one of the best western food out here in singapore, possibly the best in Ang Mo Kio. The chicken was cooked to perfection with the meat being both tender and juicy, you wouldn’t think any chicken thigh could be this good. Cherry on the top, the skin was crispy bare in mind it was takeaway. Definitely coming back for more chicken."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4cW92LWVREAE,Vincent Western Food,5,Generous portion and value for money western food. Definitely worth coming back for different dish as their menu has a variety of selections

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc3NYYUh3EAE,Vincent Western Food,5,Old-school comfort Western food best eaten on the spot. Tried the black pepper beef slices with rice and found the beef succulent and not too tough. The black pepper sauce was not too overwhelming and paired well with the beef. The buzzer system also makes ordering and waiting very orderly so overall a very pleasant experience 👍👍

I love the coleslaw,  it has pineapple in it, my favourite😋😋 yummy.

I do not stay around  Ang Mo Kio but whenever I' m nearby , I will definitely go for their chicken chop .

Another recommendation is their spaghetti beef bolognese , don't miss it 👍👍

Hope this review , will make you feel tempted to try their great food😋👍.

It's worth to travel to Ang Mo Kio

Stay safe , Healty and Happy Always ."

Recently, just this year two of my parent's long term employee are no longer working for us (>20 years). Vincent western food is lacking manpower and it has been difficult to find employees and my parents are very stressed and tired with the workload. If you have any one that wishes to work, please direct them to me and contact me at 96575643. PLS let vincent western food continue! If we are still unable to find employee, my parents will handle the stall themselves which mean longer wait time and possibly shorter opening hours due to old age. we seek your kind undertstanding."

Kids’ always like their cheesy fries, must try their cheese source! Big portion and combinations of variety of sides. Really money worth choice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdE1qV25RRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"Hawker stall with really good western food run by a bunch of hainanese folks. We had the chicken chop and pork chop, and they were very well done and tasty!! I would also recommend the fish & chips for its huge portion size.

The fries were crispy, and the garlic bread was delicious too! Very value for money, and top notch quality western food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX1ppLVdBEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"Best chicken cutlet and chop in Ang Mo Kio, some says North east as well. Great seasoning, generous portion and fast service. The lamb chop are good too! Highly recommended if you are around the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaUllc2hnRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,Still that good ol' taste. Well marinated and juicy but their chicken chop seems to have shrunk in size. While the chicken cutlet now are as big as the plate it came on.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybUt1ZXRRRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,3,"Pan fried local style, the chicken chop comes with brown sauce, baked beans, coleslaw, fries and a slice of garlic bread. The pork chop is also quite tender. Portions are hearty, but the taste of the chops can be better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3Z6T2JREAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,After I read online that this uncle from 711 S-11 opened stall here. I've always wanted to try it for myself. This smell .. this taste... Brings back memories! The coffee a bit meh though...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtak5qaXl3RRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"A place where I grew up with. Definitely to see them back after closing down at the previous location. The store offer cheap and affordable western food like Chicken Chop, Fish & Chips from $6.50.

There are other food stores to check out that the kopitiam too, like the famous BCM."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhc3FXcWlBRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"Rasa Sayang has a special place in my heart as a food stall serving Western food in Ang Mo Kio. One of my favourite places for Western food in Ang Mo Kio. I like the salmon fish it serves. The popular dishes here with most people are: Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Chop, the Chilled Ribeye Streak. Non-aircon coffeeshop environment."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNHR1elNnEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"Food that brings us back in time. Tried the chicken chop that is tender and marinated just like we do it at home, old school flavours. The chilled ribeye was correctly done(medium well) tender and juicy, the cost at $13.90, no frills steak at its best. Waiting time approx 15 to 20 mins, very reasonable with the crowds and takeaways."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaE9HOWZnEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"The famous s11 western food at amk central 711 is here at 347. Came to have a quick dinner. Taste still about same. And maybe due to cost cutting measures, portions have decreased."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X0p2U1RBEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,3,"I can imagine the fuss with wanting to taste nostalgia. Other than that, I'll say,  take your money elsewhere. We were there on a weekday evening and there were about 5-6 customers ahead of us in the queue. We got to order in about 10 minutes and I'd have to commend the kitchen for delivering at such record speed. After ordering, we waited for about 8 minutes before our orders were ready. The Mushroom Sauce Chicken Chop ($6.50) had a piece of flabby skin that was not charred to extract at least 30% of the fat. It was just cooked and not actually the way I prefer to eat my chicken skin. The piece of chicken, although tender and juicy, had quite a fowl-like odour which reminded me of chicken chops at cook houses. I have no idea how this store used to taste like, but I do not like their style of cooking now. Fries were just tasteless, not salty and blah. The slice of bread although nicely toasted, had the taste of Planta which I hate. The Grilled Salmon ($9) was under seasoned with a strong fishy taste but the doneness was just right. It was soft within and melted in the mouth, not overdone and flaky at all. The worst of the lot would have to be the Butter Garlic Lamb Chops ($12). We got a sinewy cut of the meat and the butter garlic compound was an absolute horror. It was made of Planta margarine and dried rosemary..nothing in it had the taste of butter or garlic! All in all, it's great if you miss the taste of 90's style western food at an inflated price. Otherwise, it's just cheap ingredients, canned beans and junk sold at a premium price. I could walk over to the coffeeshop next door and get a chicken chop at $5. Perhaps our taste buds have evolved and we're now spoilt for choices when it comes to customizable fancy sides like sauteed mushrooms, roasted sweet potatoes, mac n cheese and the like."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dXNHRE53EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"The “S-11” western food is finally back! Glad to see the entire family back in the stall as we have been patronizing this stall since my secondary school days.
Try the chicken cutlet. It’s so soft and nice! Hope to see fried rice back on the menu."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OWJ5V0JREAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,Nice old school western food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNnV2VTR3RRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,Ordered the chicken chop for takeaway. Have patronised this stall many times. Chicken chop with mushroom sauce is not bad. Old school kind of taste. Generous with chilli sauce. Service is good too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdzdXRmFnEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,3,"Good point is that meat is tender. However, taste-wise is just okok. Perhaps because the chicken chop is marinated more salty, the spaghetti was made diluted and bland (to the extent that the flour taste from pasta was so obvious and the spaghetti tasted amateurish though texture was al Dante). Auntie was also very irritated when I tried to ask if they had alternatives to tomato base... For $7.30, it did not feel worth nor did the portion make up for it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldGJic09REAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"Great food, love the pork cutlet. Lady boss very friendly"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzdubDlRRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,3,"To myself, considering 7SGD for an order of pork chop or chicken cutlet is pretty high cost in heartland of AMK Ave 3, both meals taste and presentation do not possess the weight to fetch the amt. The pork chop is dry luckily the mushroom help that, the coleshaw is soggy and the tomato bean has blunt taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MWMyYWNREAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,Glad that they reopened. The serving size is still as huge as I recall. The chicken cutlet is tender and the amount of bread crumbs used was just right. It gave the cutlet just the right amount of crunch that wasn't too hard like some other places. Would be coming back again. Currently they only have the spaghetti option. Hope they bring back the fried rice soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbHI3NlN3EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,3,My 1st visit to the famed Rasa Sayang Western and I ordered the steak with mushroom sauce. I asked for medium and it came out perfectly done and taste factor was definitely very good for coffeeshop standards! Will definitely be back to try other dishes!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLczRHLXJ3RRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"Perfect old school western pork chop, the grilled taste was not overpowering and blend well with mushroom brown sauce. No wonder it’s always sold out!
Was so good that I’m commenting in midst of eating 👍🏻
friendly uncle too, can see whole team take pride in serving a good plate of food to you."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbThYMEJBEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"had the chicken chop which made rasa sayang western food famous.. comes with fries, baked beans, garlic bread, coleslaw on the side.. but the winner here is definitely the brown sauce... comforting food and value for money.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bXRmMGR3EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"If you stayed or studied around Ang Mo Kio Central area, you should be familiar with Rasa Sayang Western Food that’s located at the S-11 coffeeshop next to Jubilee Square

A few years ago, the stall was taken over by a group of young owners, and well, the standards dropped drastically.

I’m really excited that the original owners have reopened at a coffee shop opposite AMK Hub, about 10-15 minutes’ walk away!

While most people ordered their value-for-money chicken cutlet, I ordered their Chicken Chop ($6.50) which is probably one of the best old school Hainanese western food I’ve ever eaten.

While the sides like fries, baked beans and even the slice of garlic bread is nothing exciting, the star of the dish is their mushroom sauce.

Perfectly balanced, not overly salty, with hints of chicken stock and slices of soft button mushrooms, this sauce makes the long queue worth it.

Chicken was grilled well and lightly charred to add a layer of smokiness that compliments the sauce.

P.S. Don’t waste the sauce, use the fries to scoop up every bit of it! 😋"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dHFrSRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"Quite satisfied with the huge piece of chicken cutlet.  Nicely cooked.  I was the last customer at 8.30pm today.  Several others were turned away as the food was sold out way before the closing hours.  Queued for about 15 mins.  Waiting time for food was about 10mins.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbloyVEZREAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"Went over to try during lunch time. Conveniently located, it is opp amk hub, and the way over is all fully sheltered.
Tried their ribeye steak and is very happy with it! The meat is really tender and was cooked to medium rare ask requested! The mushroom sauce goes perfectly well with it as well~ Love the fries as well! Dipping it in the baked beans sauce. The only item that was not up to par was the garlic bread. It doesn't have much garlic taste and it was rather sandy instead of crispy.
This is definitely a place that I will be going back to if I am around the area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXy02bk1BEAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,2,"One of the iconic western food stall in Ang Mo Kio, they used to be at the S11 coffeeshop at block  711 for quite some time before taking a short break and they are back in operations at a coffeeshop walking distance away from their previous location. Decided to check this place out since i was in Ang Mo Kio. The coffeeshop was packed with people and it wasn't easy for me to get a table.

Ordering was pretty straight forward, you will be issued a buzzer once you have paid. I ordered the chicken chop which was SGD$6.50. Food was ready in no time. Portion wise, seems quite little. My chicken chop was a little tough. It was seasoned well as certain parts tasted extremely salty.

Overall, quite disappointed with the overall experience. There are many western food stalls outside that are better in terms of quality. Dont think that it is worth the hype."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bG92aG1BRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,"The taste is almost 90% similar to last time.. but it's good enough for me to give 5 stars.. maybe give auntie/uncle warm up for like 1 month then the taste will be 100% the same..

Very value for money and nice.. but expect around 30min wait during meals time..

The distance is the same as walking from amk hub to the s11 coffee shop..

Please do support the uncles and aunties"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOS1xaWhnRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,Previously in AMK central s11. Now reopen here. I would say its the best chicken chop ever.  Great sauce and tender chicken. 6.50 and its worth it.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbFB5MGV3EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,Value for money. Previously at S11 amk Central. This hainanese western stall is a classic example of simple Western  food goodness. Uncle and Aunty still same same.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcXB5MWpBRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,Chicken cutlet is the best value for money. It is super crunchy and the portion is so big I could never finish in one sitting. The rest like chicken chop and fish and chips are ok only.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdV95Nll3EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,4,"Chicken chop is indeed nice, meat is juicy and tender, worth the four star rating I am giving. Not five star, because of the pricing, which is abit on the steep side. $7 for chicken chop, not many people can accept that pricing."

Ordered a Chicken Cutlet. Waited for only around 5 mins. Super fast.

The chicken cutlet is huge, probably as big as an adult's face, and it comes with coleslaw, baked beans, French fries and a toast. Have to say that it's very worth the $7 I paid for it.

Nice crunch to the cutlet and its not too dry, just under-seasoned. It made me wished for some gravy or sauce to dip the chicken into.

Overall, not too bad for the price I paid."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdC1EcjR3RRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,Nicely lit stall with an even nicer uncle recommending me what to order. Ordered the ribeye.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhMkk3amhRRRAB,Rasa Sayang Western Food,5,The fries are great. It has this soft potato flavour. The fried fish is huge! Had to share with my son. All in all good old school western food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNHJmNEZ3EAE,Rasa Sayang Western Food,2,Food is good. But owner attitude is bad. Tartar sauce diluted but still gave little then ask for more. Said need charged $1 when is so watery. Then some buyers haven't claim their food. The owner shouted say who buzzer keep beeping come and collected in a very rude attitude. Nice food but bad attitude. Just caz biz good doesn't mean should be cocky.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNWNDUHB3RRAB,Western Food Stall,5,"Have ordered takeaway Fish and Chip and Pork Chop from this stall many times this year. The portion is huge for the price. A set meal come with french fries, baked beans, coleslaw, garlic bread, lemon and sauces. I avoid ordering fried rice as it was cold and hard. On Sundays evening, they sell out fast. Must go before 7pm! Take note that the cashier auntie maybe a little rude sometimes."

Like that their fries r those thicker zigzag ones, the coleslaw taste good, nice garlic toast (fresh loaf kind). The fish n chip comes with a big slice of lemon. For $6.5, the portion is fair"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcXZtUTlBRRAB,Western Food Stall,5,"This stall has no name, so its ""signboard"" just says ""Western Food"". Located in S-11 hawker center, which is the one just beside Jubilee Square. There is only 1 western stall, so it's quite easy to spot. One of the few underrated Western food stalls in hawker centers.

I've been here quite a few times and I must say I like the really generous portions and affordable price. A usual chicken chop at $6.5 gets you the chicken chop, fries, garlic bread, baked beans and coleslaw. Portion is easily visible in my photo.
I got the photo of the salted egg yolk fried chicken cutlet. Too fried for my liking, but still a sinful and enjoyable meal overall. Salted egg yolk sauce is a bit little, but it was quite thick.

The auntie used to be a bit rude since last time, and customer service was bad as well. But over the years I've observed improvement. And who cares about bad attitude, as long as the food is good right? (Cues those expensive restaurants with bad service staff attitude)
Those days where you feel like having a cheat day/meal? 😜 Yeap this is right where you wanna go to."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbE9uX2RnEAE,Chef Recipe @ Ang Mo Kio,4,Western food with a wide selected compared to typical Western store. Has baked rice but its basically fried rice layer with cheese on top. A good break away from typical Western food flavour. Portion is decent and the food is served with plating similar to a restaurant which makes the portions look much bigger compared to normal stalls.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaHV2bER3EAE,Chef Recipe @ Ang Mo Kio,1,"Worst burger my brother has ever eaten; stuffed with wedges. Pan fried mushroom was bitter, wedges was still a bit raw, black pepper sauce was terribly salty and chicken chop was burnt."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOGRmck93EAE,Chef Recipe @ Ang Mo Kio,2,"Ordered a dish that came with free mushroom soup...except that they didn't even have mushroom soup. The cashier said they would compensate me with more fries and salad. However the serving was still pretty meagre. The chicken took a long time to arrive, and I had to go back to ask about it. They then proceeded to hand me a buzzer. So I guess I had to wait a second round. Eventually the food came, chicken was ok though the sauce was good, overall I felt it wasn't worth the $7.5 though, I'd skip this and go straight for the $1.3 dim sum...there's some serious competition at this place and there's no excuse for advertising a free food item that isn't ready...how strange.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ05YaW53RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Ordered grilled pork chop and chicken chop with spaghetti. The pork chop was one of the better one I had tried as most of the time pork chop tends to be tough. The sides were nice especially the curly fries, they were hot and crispy. The chicken chop was good too though the spaghetti was more average (a lighter version). I will definitely visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnB5RUJnEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,The ribeye steak is definitely one of the best in value and taste. Not a fan of pork but the pan seared fish is great too. Love the mushroom soup and it a must have item.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNkozRUx3EAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Portions are big n very value for money

Really like the buttered corn as very gao like those in Malaysia

Curly fries taste like MacDonald but after taste got heavy msg taste.

Chicken cutlet is indeed bland n has frozen chicken taste like other mention. Chicken chop w black pepper so so nothing special

I will come back for the corn. It’s that good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2F6YUJBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Ordered the chicken chop with mushroom sauce ($7.90) for takeaway. One of the better ones out there, the sauce was thick and flavouful. The chicken chop was tender and juicy. Curly fries was nicely done too, crispy and fragrant. The corn was sweet and nice. Salad was average only. Will definitely return to try the other items."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtc0s3X1FBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Very nice place for value for money grill. It is located in a coffee shop. The place is very casual and relax atmosphere. There are a few other stalls in this coffee shop.
Ordered a ribeye steak in black pepper sauce at a good price. It is nicely done and comparable to those restaurant standard. Also ordered the lamb shank. Not too bad for that price.
Overall it is a wonderful experience. Definitely great value for the price and I will be back if I need a steak fix in a casual manner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN0tTNjF3RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Ordered 2 rib-eye steaks with garlic merlot sauce at $16 each thanks to Shopee. Redemption was fast and easy. Good quality for the price - steak was juicy and tender with minimum amt of fat and loved the garlic merlot sauce, curly fries was crispy (I suspect it's the frozen ones you can get at the supermarket), corn was sweet and well flavoured, but I found the coleslaw to be too sweet. Overall, highly recommend!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzRIUEZREAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"I seldom post 5 stars, but this simply blows away.
We ordered fish and chips, lamb shank and mushroom soup.
Really good. Lamb shank meat easily slide off the bone, no weird gamey smell. The black pepper sauce complements well.
Mushroom soup flavory with real mushroom bits and spice.
Fish and chip also very good.
Paying slightly more than usual coffeeshop price but u get a high quality western food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1blpUU2xnRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Ordered the ribeye with garlic merlot sauce (200g) and I must say it’s totally worth the price at $18.90.
The ribeye I have at other places usually serves with the bone intact but here the chef took away the bones and made it so much easier to eat. Ordered medium done to perfection. As the sauce blends well with the meat too, every mouth is full of flavours. Portion is big too and one feels really full after the meal. Curly fries are nicely done and very crispy.

Highly recommended 👍🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbzhmMllBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Overwhelmed by the wide selections and price tag at first sight. But take note that it's a masterpiece from an ex-hotel chef. I went on and ordered their Rib Eye Steak with Garlic Merlot Butter Sauce at medium well doneness. Should have gone for medium rare when I saw my friend's cos I'm afraid of my piece of steak keep bleeding 🤣 Anyway, plus point for curly fries!! 🙌"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MDg2ME5REAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,We tried their Rib Eye Steak (medium doneness) with Black Pepper sauce and Hickory Smoked BBQ Pork Rib from their many items for lunch. Serving sizes were big and waiting time was around 10 minutes. Crispy curly fries were really nice. We had different views on the corns and coleslaw. Meats could easily be torn apart. Only thing was that pork rib sauce was a bit too salty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXblpXdE1BEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Ordered the bbq pork ribs and rib eye steak with garlic merlot sauce. Ribs were nice and tender, steak was a little more well done than desired, however dishes were overall value for money with generous portion sizes. I've in particularly enjoyed the sweet corn on the side. Purchase shopee vouchers to get $2 off selected dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazluOGtBRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,A western food gem in AMK! The mushroom brown sauce was really good and we love the curly fries! There is an ongoing Shopee promotion where you can get $2 off every payment transaction!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNXAyWG53RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Went to this area actually to look for something else then came across this western sounding western food stall, but manned by 2 chinese people. They were busy with orders so tried a combo n a fish plate. This is easily one of the top coffee shop style western food. Breaded fish has fish, pork is not overpowered by the usual western food sauce from other places, curly fries is not overly oily taste. The big menu makes it easy to see the dishes n order. However the ordering area is hot. It is filled with lcd screens and very hot spotlights."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cE9yVXR3RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Been there a few times. Yesterday, as a privilege of the last customer during the day hour. I was given extra fries for free. 😍 absolute value for money. Taste of the food is also very nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa0kycHR3RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Ordered mushroom sauce rib eye steak. Ordered medium but was unevenly cooked. Otherwise no complains, was a good plate of steak with nice amount of sides. If u want fuss free quality western food this is worth a consideration."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOU9yNjB3RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,3,"Rib eye garlic butter medium rare.
The searing wasn't sufficient. It was soggy. The steak itself could do with a little more salting, it was flat.
Still, it wasn't expensive and the curly fries are some of the best I've had.
Where else can you get ribeye for this price?

Yeah the fries are addictive.

Gonna come back for other stuff and order more curly fries."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdklXNS13RRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Liked the mushroom soup, and ribeye with merlot sauce. BBQ ribs was fall-off-the -bone tender. Battered fish n chips is a bit soggy, tho well flavoured. Huge serving of curly fries; but taste like the frozen type."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc3B6dEpBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Came on Thursday 5.30pm, had a line and waited for about 10mins to place our order.

We had the fish & chips, chicken wings w Cajun rice and mushroom soup.

My thoughts:
Fish & chips was the battered kind!!!!! Something to be mentioned as it is not common to find battered fish outside of restaurant establishment. The fish was rather thick and well seasoned, the batter was really light and crispy. The tatar sauce that came w it seems like self-made and was strong on the raw onion taste. It matches well with the fish. $7.50 for this battered fish and chips is a steal.

Chicken wings w cajun rice on the other hand was alright. The chicken wings was slightly soggy, but well seasoned. The cajun rice had a pretty strong smoky taste, probably from capsicums. It came w 1 slice of broccoli. Overall feel of this dish was meh.

Mushroom soup is really good, different from outside. The ingredients was blended really finely, so not much mushroom chunks (abit sad tho). However the taste of the soup is very yummy and didn't feel too jelat. I could probably down 2 bowls of it.

Going to come back to try out their grills as we heard so many people ordering their steaks while eating."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDhHOGdBRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,This Jones is definitely better than the other Jones. Food wise/price wise all win. The presentation u know they put in effort. Sweet corn/coleslaw and yes the curly fries definitely on point. So for anyone who wants a decent western meal can come here and try out their huge variety of choices . I will be definitely be back to try all their food on the menu. Shangri-la chef ok don't play play .....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzZUUFNBEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,I believe in the category of coffeeshop western food this is the best I have eaten so far. I ordered chicken chop and it’s nicely grilled whereby it is not over cooked and dry and not rare and undercooked. Taste profile might be considered less flavourful by many but alright by me. Feel like this way I can taste the actual taste of the raw material and not just flavouring and msg. Side dish is curly fries which is fried skilfully such that it is not served drenched in oil. I just noticed I used a lot of “not” expression to describe the food here. It’s is definitely not what you get at all coffeeshop western food stores out there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzeWYzVDFBRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"The breaded chicken cutlet is big and well fried but the meat is bland. The tenderness of pork ribs ($16.90) is decent, comes with garlic chilli sauce which is moderate sweet.

The corns are sweet. Curl fries are well fried. Fried rice and mashed potato are average. Coleslaw is watery and below average.

In general, the portion is huge and main dishes taste better above average. Quick fix in the neighbourhood area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaHFHXzVRRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Good, reasonably priced western food.  The BBQ PorkRibs tasted awesome, garlic fish nice too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwN3FYdU53EAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Value for money, delicious and large portion. The Steak was really good and the garlic butter was fantastic, definitely a must try! Chicken is really tender and juicy, buttered corn is really crunchy and nicely buttered with generous servings of curly fries. A must go to for those staying in the area!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2RuZU5BEAE,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,4,"Came here to try after watching their FB marketing Champaign.

Chicken chicken chop with mushroom sauce, $7.50.  At first thought it’s definitely more expensive comparing with other coffeeshop western food. However they made it up with proportional portions and the mushroom sauce is really good.

Prawn Aglio Olio $8.90. Is pretty decent with 4 beautiful prawns that’s pretty well cooked.
However I feel that it’s a bit too spicy on the general side.

Overall it’s good enough for me to come back once in a while. Next time I’ll try their steak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwaTZ6cm5nRRAB,Papa Jones BBQ and Grill,5,"Great food at affordable prices. Ordered a Ribeye and it was cooked beautifully. The garlic butter Merlot sauce is incredibly creamy with a good amount of flavor that goes well with the steak.

Will definitely come again for meals soon."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNmJuN1BREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,Dining environment is pleasant. Ordered Rosti n Sausage and make it a set with mushroom soup and root beer. Added a onion rings basket. Overall food is good and value for money. However root beer is served 3/4 full and scoop of ice cream is small. Hope that this can be improved.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXBfMUFREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Pasta is quite good, but the prawn is stuck to its shell & hard to deshell.

The brownie ice cream dessert - the brownie is too sweet; it needs the ice cream to dilute the sweetness.

Unfortunately Buddy Hoagies had removed waffles from its menu, which was one of the highlights for visiting. It’s disappointing and we might not be going out of our way to visit it as a result."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc1pEOUdBEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Been A Few Times There. Tried The Rosti And Taste Great As Well. Mushroom Soup Creamy With Lots Of Mushroom Bits. Affordable Western Food Worth To Try.

One of the best places to have western food apart from Ashton's.

Pictures speak a thousand words.
:) Do note the crowd during peak hours."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaTctYlFREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"A 10-15mins walk from AMK Station, located in Ditjsun Mall.  First time there and I love the food there! The staffs are also friendly and quick to serve. Got the Double up black pepper grilled chicken and the fried one. The portion was pretty big compare to Astons! It was very filling for both me and my bf. We also got the tom yum crab pasta which is very creamy and has the subtle tom yum taste and it is not overwhelming compared to other Tom Yum pasta. We both added $6 for the set meal (mushroom/minestrone soup , garlic bread and root beer float). Overall the dining in was a pretty good experience. There's GST and service charges but compare to other Western restaurants it is still affordable. Can get the double up chicken and share with your other half too! Would definitely go back!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeTZuSjB3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,The only reason that I visit Djitsun mall is for this restaurant haha. Love the peppery grilled chicken. Staff were polite too. Thumbs up!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOGRuYlJnEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,3,"The last time I visited Buddy Hoagies, the chicken was dry and hard. The ribs tasted like it was left from the previous night, very dry. That was almost two years ago, if I remember right.

I gave it another shot today. I head inside the restaurant half expecting the chicken being dry and hard again. I was greeted by friendly staffs. Nice.

I ordered the mixed grill that comes with a sausage, chicken and pork, served with coleslaw and onion rings. The set came with a drink and either a mushroom soup or minestrone soup. I chose the former.

The mushroom soup tasted bland. It’s white in colour. I do not know if it’s supposed to be that white. They serve a slice of soft bread with garlic spread. Nothing fancy.

The main course came before I could finish my soup. Fast. Too fast. I’m fine with it since I did not like the soup. This time round the chicken was moist. Thank goodness for that. The pork was smaller in size but tasted moist too. The coleslaw was not heavy on the sauce. Maybe if they give you a small wedge of lemon for your coleslaw would be nice. Anyway the onion rings were cold. If felt like the cook had made a basket of it and just left it there till someone orders it. Should have ordered the hot veggies instead.

Overall, pleasant experience especially the friendly staffs. Food wise, eerrrmmm, ok."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXJmTExBEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"I've walked past this cafe several times but this was my first time actually dining in. We were pleasantly surprised by the sheer variety offered. The food was also reasonably priced and the portions were generous.

The fish was very fresh with a nice thin crispy batter, chicken was of a decent size despite it being part of the combo and the rib eye steak was perfect without the gamey taste. The baked potato was done perfectly, with the skin being easily separated from the potato -unlike most other places! Will be back to try other dishes."

It provide a very pleasant dinning experience, my family like it, we will certainly back again. Well done!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdHRqZE5nEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Haven’t been to this place for a long time! But during the first time trying out at this outlet, the food was really delicious! The restaurant is very spacious! Must try for the Rosti! Rosti is actually a type of potato that is baked. A bit like prata though. I also like the sausage that came with the Rosti. It is curled like a snail shape. I even liked the beverages served in the menu."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwb2RLaXdnRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Value for money place. I come here every weekend cos all the Tuition Centre’s are here thus a convenient place for a meal.

Nice ambience for about $15 per pax for lunch.

The grilled fish with Tom Yum sauce was our favorite but unfortunately they took it off the menu as it was a temporary promotion.

The current promotion of lamb chops aren’t that great. Too thinly sliced and tough.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbE9hX1dREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Nice Western food for the price at a restaurant, has promotions for lunch but went there for dinner so it was quiet and not so crowded, suitable for small group gatherings and family, kids get apple juice when they order from the kids menu.

Spacious and good lighting, water is self serve and you can pick either hot or cold water from the dispenser.

Ordered the chicken baked rice while my friend picked the steak. Her steak was juicy and the doneness was medium just as she requested. I enjoyed the cheesy chicken bake rice, as I find the rice fragrant and the cheese went well with it.

Desserts wise they have a couple of interesting choices, drinks as well but we were rushing off elsewhere so if you have time and just want to chill at the restaurant you could order dessert and drinks to share.

Service staff were friendly and nice. Overall a pleasant experience. The food is homely and will visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbUtTdzdRRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Fast and efficient, friendly service, good food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVb1lmUGV3EAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Brought my family here for the 1st time.  This place definitely deserves a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ mainly for the pricing and no nonsense good service.

However it failed to get the last star due to its sloppy mushroom soup, garlic bread could have been a bit more toasted.
The saddest part was the steaks were too “Chao Tah”.  Otherwise my steak would have been superb."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMWJPMjZ3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Food was Super delicious, price was reasonable 👍🏻and their ambiance there was very nice with 90s style design.overall had a nice time and good food there, would go back again 😁"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMklUTUtBEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,2,"I love rosti but the rosti here was a total disappointment. It was just bland and tasteless and the sour cream was a joke too! It taste completely plain, not sour enough, not creamy enough. Mac and cheese was also lack of flavor. Pork ribs doesn't have the smokey grill BBQ taste. Everything just, bleh. Service was prompt but that's it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzX3NUWmxnRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Nice food! Very old school western food, like those that were widely available in SG. Very similar to swensen’s. Good value for money, would recommend!

Nice environment for families, there is a little play corner to keep the little ones entertained."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LTU2cWNREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,3,"Valuable for money..taste wise average , can be improved...cosy place for a quick western meal fix."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaEpxUnJ3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,Good food for the price range. Free set meal upgrade for lunch time.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbHFQTU13EAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Value for money
Love the grilled chicken and baked potato
Lamp chop is great too
Chicken wings also yummy"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwLXFpdFBREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"We used to always visit this place when it was at Khatib.  It's moved to AMK for 4 years but we always come here once in a while as a treat. We know the owner and the food is good. I didn't take photos of the food today (too famished), BUT here's a pic of their awesome brownie with vanilla ice-cream!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHcy1YMnZRRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Reasonably price, convenient located, nice food and service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNVpDQlN3EAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,Very nice food and service. I have given one less star as one thing not to try is the tiramisu. Is like a pudding and have a very firm texture.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aXRUbU5nEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"Always good value with delicious food at super reasonable prices.
The bbq ribs were so yummy !! Will definitely return soon !!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPakotYWhBRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Good service during weekday lunch. Food is nice and reasonable price. A nice place to bring kids too. Have student meal. The ice tea is nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3BlbTh3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,1,"That rootbeer, when serve is not full, stingy, potato also ,need to dig it and taste like normal, not recommend, won't come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeV9LM2FnEAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Food here is tasty and decently priced. Rosti was crispy! Chargrilled chicken was juicy as well. Service was attentive and friendly. Will definitely return. 😊
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjc0szOUhREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,3,"The soup just lack of depth, the carbonara a bit to salty for my taste but it may be just nice for others, otherwise the food is ok"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnc09iU2JREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Very good fried fish hoagie which is uncommon to find in Singapore. Personally like it better than the typical sandwich franchise offerings. Good pricing and casual ambience for family meals.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbDZER2lRRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"I ordered Flamed Grilled Chicken with 2 sides - baked potato and hot veggies. The highlight is the flamed grilled chicken with the tic tac toe marks - they make you wanna play with it. But my stomach said, ""Feed me!"" So I did. And lovin' it (even without the chicken gravy). By the way, don't get fooled by the thin looking chicken meat. It has no skin or fatty parts so you are getting real flame grilled meat. I wish I have 1 more stomach within me for another piece of chicken!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNWJ1R0Z3EAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Awesome service! Very friendly and attentive staff. Food portion is reasonable and good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNTZ6cm1nRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,"Great food, great ambience, and really great customer service especially from waitress Angela. We appreciate the pleasant experience. The customer service team was distinctly a few grades above any other restaurant that evening. Kudos to Angela for being really thoughtful and offering to charge when she knew that our phones had run out of battery. Would definitely come back for the customer service. Give Angela a raise already! haha"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNkozZVpREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,the food is really worth it. portion is very big and it's not too expensive. The soup and garlic bread is not the best but everything else is really good for the price. I would really recommend the ribs.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbXBQM21RRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Their steaks are always the best among it's price range
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZa1lHTFdREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,Reasonable price and good food. I used to come here for lunch and nice place to get together.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNDUtQjBnRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,"A family friendly outlet with open ceiling, a nostalgic ambience with rock stars photos on the wall, menu valued for money and friendly staff that makes a heartful satisfied dinner of the day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc3V1UGp3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,4,Western Food At Economical Pricing. Worth every penny. Better cook than their WWP branch
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaG9mMllREAE,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,5,Had a nice gathering with friends in the past week. The food is good value for price. The fish and chips was done nicely.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4OTR2cTFRRRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,3,Nice western food at reasonable prices but seating arrangements are very bad. All diners seated back to back with no safe distancing measures. Not a safe place to patronise during current Covid-19 situations.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbU11enB3RRAB,Buddy Hoagies Steak & Grill,1,Bad fish and chips. Barter is too hard. Coleslaw is bland. Onion rings is soggy. Won’t be back here again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOS11SEN3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"We dined in from 12+ to 3pm and we're served by polite, friendly and attentive crew. The Manager allowed us to bring a birthday cake from external when I commended that the slice of cake on the menu was too small. It was an enjoyable experience. Highly recommend Collin's @ Jubilee!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajY2T293RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Excellent food. Ordered premium mixed grill (lamb chop, chicken chop, pork chop) and seafood bouillabaisse. All meat from the premium mixed grill are extremely tender and juicy, even in 100% cooked / well done situation. 👍 seafood bouillabaisse is tasty, seafood is fresh and tender. Must try. 11am to 5pm, weekday (except public holiday) has 20% off."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHM3BfV0dnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Food was decent and there was a promotion for the tomahawk steak which was super delicious. The meat melts in your mouth when savouring.

The seafood plater was a good sharing plate as well making our meal of 4 a happy and enjoyable one."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNkpPbTR3RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Had the October promo. Ordered 1 main and free 2 side. October special pork platter usual price $30 plus going for $15. Very big portion and super value for money.

Highly recommanded. Love the fried squid and the marinate. Service is excellent and friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaGRUUFZREAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"loved the lobster pasta. lobster cooked well, pasta was flavourful, and exactly how I like it. ordered the set with the mushroom soup which had a hint of truffle scent, as well as the lychee soda which was very refreshing. decent meal with good service!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOGR1Vm13RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,1,ordered mixed grill ($22) and the portion was shockingly small compared to the ones served at other Collins outlets I've been to. Pork chop was much smaller than the size of my palm and chicken chop was obviously cut by a knife which reduced it to half its original portion
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd0tteW9nRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,2,"First time back after a long while. Ordered the chicken chop which came with spaghetti aglio aglio. The chicken was done well but the latter was just a tad away from being cooked al dente. To be honest, it was still uncooked. The server kindly changed this for me. I asked if the chef is new - she affirmed this. Also, my daughter ordered the salmon baked pasta but she was served baked rice instead. She was ok to have this, but the staff should really be more careful. It was not as if the staff were overstretched because of the lunch crowd - we were there after half past two and there were only a few tables of diners."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMWJUVUJ3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"Charging for water at a restaurant is a total put off for me.
Unfortunately, I have placed my food orders.
Add to your food cost, because not all will will looked at your 50 cents hidden on your haddock or duck.
Food was good, no complaints except your salad was not fresh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla2RmVGNnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"food was good, but only if you are a student. Istg the prices here have skyrocketed since I last came here to eat. recommend the food 8/10 but if you come here make sure ure a student. if not the prices here are like 16.90 for a bowl of spaghetti. bit I must admit try the dessert pizza. picture of the student meals are below"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldGI3eUZBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"The food is beyond amazing and staff are great and friendly
Reasonably priced and great ambience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cy1MN2RnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,First time at this branch. Food as usual nice. Nothing to shout for though.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOU95MGl3RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"I had their classic series Bi Feng Tang Fish and Chips (I requested to change out the corn cob for coleslaw) and it tasted fresh and great! It was well-fried, not too dry and oily 👍👍The garlic crumbs topping enhanced the overall taste and aroma of the fish! No fishy smell at all! Received good customer service from the team too, especially the malay lady (didn’t managed to get her name) 👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeU0zQmJnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"There was promotion for lunch , would say that was not as expected as it is talk about.
Salmon with spegathi was just ok ..my friends steak was soso only."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcXJQZ0tBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"We tried out their promo menu as suggested by their staffs…not bad at all..

Their pastas are nice… too bad.. forgot to take the picture of it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OWItLTBRRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Very nicely battered Fish & Chips.
A better deal if you are a student, they offer half price for students for some of their dishes for lunch"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNjhLZWl3RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"Haven't been here for a while. Good quality food at reasonable prices. Family had an enjoyable and fulfilling meal. Steak and deep fried food were great! If anything, the ribs needed more sauce and the seafood baked rice wasn't that tasty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDRDdW1nRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"Portions are huge, food tastes great, value for money!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzUzUEFREAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,1,"waste of money. truffle fries with no truffle and parmesan, and mixed grill meal that is the size of a kids meal. the duck was the worst, literally one drumstick that doesn't taste great"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLc0xQWkZ3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Went on Sunday around 3.30pm, got a table immediately without queuing.
Many more choices for food than the franchise HDB stall.
Food tastes good. Staff is helpful.
Many oders for delivery during our meal time.
This restaurant provides lunch promotion during weekdays. You may pay a visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMnR6NlNnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"Prices increase main course costs at least $20 now. Fish is hard and chewy??!! Best is their whole calamari very soft with smoky taste, won’t come back again"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejRuTVhBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"The food is good, the pork could be better.
Service is excellent and food were served very fast."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpMnIyTE5BEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,Best Chicken Chop I've ever had in Singapore! I paid $15 for a Chicken chop with a drink and a side under their lunch special on weekdays! I'll definitely come back here again. I recommend Collin's for those looking for a good western meal. I also loved the fast service and friendly staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxc3RYbFV3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"Staff seems bored at work

Barramundi is ok. Gave feedback that Vegetable and mushroom is very salty but no respond from the manager. I had to drink lots of water to flush it down..

The Home made baked potatoes is good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcGR2UklBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"One of our favourite venues for meals when the family decides to eat out.
The prices are reasonable and the portions are rather huge so it is value for money.
Being a member gives you 10% discount.
The lava cake is superb.
Not wanting to be bias, should visit this restaurant at least once and decide for yourself. At least satisfy your curiosity.
Only inconvenience is that no booking or reservation is allowed and you have to queue up like the others, but if you have time to spare, give it a shot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlb09pZlR3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was also tasty and worth the higher price. Penne Au Gratin was too bland for my liking, but the prawns inside were perfectly cooked."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2ZHUXhBRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,1,This is lousy food!!! Feel angry to eat!! This is last we eat at amk restaurant collin!!! Pork rib charcoal the meat is cold!!! What the chef experience of this?? Just learning to cook? This is last we eat at collin....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4a3ZtTUlBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Great ambience. Staffs are very polite and attentive. Some waiting time due to reduce seatings. Food servings are quite fast and all very nicely presented. Currently they are running a GSS 50% off Wagyu steak @ 37.50+  comes with a drink, side veg bowl, soup and garlic bread. Very worth it. Steak is nicely done n juicy. Soup is tasty and good to go with the crispy garlic bread."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldE9xSlFBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"Good variety of dishes, from appetizers to mains. Quality and taste of most of their food are above average. A few items l'll always order when l'm there are their mushroom soup, angus beef and seafood risotto. Another couple of positives are their fast and efficient service and  reasonable prices."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldFpQTGNnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,1,Tried out the chicken cutlet. Feels like the cutlet is just a thin slice of chicken meat flatten and fried. Not really worth the price tagged to the dish.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMDQySVJnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"First time at a Collin's, always been intrigued by their dry aging fridge, so decided to give it a try. Ordered the US  Mishima Wagyu ribeye steak (MS5, 250gm) and carbonara. I think they were doing pretty ok with their offering, till I get to the over cooked part of the steak - which was thinly sliced in the first place - making it pretty hard to sear and control doneness. Still very decent I think."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4eWRmcldnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"Food here is generally good. Portion is generous in most cases. So far I have not tried anything that stands out for me. Service was alright. Not much queueing on a public holiday probably due to COVID. Cost is slightly above average. Ambiance is ok for conversations. Parking is plenty but some distance away.
Standard seems to have dropped during the pandemic. Asked for Medium Rare but Wagyu was cooked to Medium instead. Clam Chowder was shown on menu to be the white, cream based, type but what came was the orange, tomato based, type."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvaDlyV3NnRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"food is great at good portions and reasonable prices. there's a wide selection of western dishes so it's worth a second visit to try more.

staff is friendly and helpful. there's a fired oven for your pizza so you have a real authentic taste!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bjVqMHNnRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"The food is good.. i enjoyed my sirloin steak and my folks enjoy the food they ordered.. but the order taking got messed up. We ordered a seafood mixed combo but was served a beef mixed combo.. maybe the naming should differ so as to prevent mixed up.. overall its ok, we came for the food afterall"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdWEyZGlnRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"3rd time went to Collin's, my hb like de food & ambience there, we went there for my hb birthday celebrations, coincidentally they hv Xmas set offer, really worth the price, till now he still missed his bday meal... 😅🤭"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNReDctVE9nEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,2,"We would like to think that the waiter discreetly warned us a couple of times subtly over selection not being wise. 1- repeating and reconfirming a meal selection/add on a couple of times, 2- end up not serving the add-on(paid $2), 3-we even asked for the add on and then it was served. Moral of the story: listen to subtle signs there.
Overall it was okay, approximately $170 for six of us, inclusive of drink and soup or dessert; there was a set meal option available to all main courses with an addition of 6.50-drinks were already close to that price."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVaWQ3U3NnRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"Went during lunch and so you get either a selected drink/side/dessert with any main. The size of the portions actually differ from outlet to outlet. The portion here is actually good for me but when I dined at the Balestier outlet, it was a very generous portion with a mountain of pasta and salad that it was enough for 2, but that outlet has since closed.

Service crew is helpful and polite and food was served relatively quickly from time of ordering that I actually suspect if they had already pre-cooked everything and just microwaved it to serve.

Payment was slow, queued almost 10 minutes just to pay and that is a long time to stand considering that there were only 2 other person in front of me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcHVqSkp3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Very great experience. Food was delicious and worth it. Delightfully surprised that they use haddock (and not dory) for their fish and chips. Haddock has more flavor and has a firmer texture. Fries are thoroughly seasoned with spices and crispy. Even came with cheese and tartar sauce.

Duck confit was moist and just falls off the bone.

Would definitely return and I highly recommend the fish and chips."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNWEzYkt3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,"01:07/19
The Argentina beef is tender but not beefy like American Prime Beef. The salmons bake rice with egg goes very well with the cheese. Both dishes are ok but the portion is rather small. Will probably return for 250g waygu beef next time. The service staff is fantastic."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRenFMdjBRRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"The queue starts at about 6pm for dinner. Overall, the food is pretty yummy. The buffalo drumstick is really flavourful and tasty. The sweet potato fries is crispy and soft, even though the sweet potato itself is not sweet. The black pepper medium steak is tender. The side salad comes mixed in a sour and sweet sauce which makes the vege very appetising. The prawn marinara spaghetti is al dente, and the prawn is very crunchy and lightly marinated with a salty fresh taste. The chicken chop taste great, and not so much fats. The oven baked haddock fish with penne is quite okay. The texture of the penne is just right, and the tomato sauce is nice and not too sour. The fish could have a bit more taste though. The add on mushroom soup is the standard kind, and can do better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcWVPdlR3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Decent prices, great atmosphere, an extensive menu, and food that does not disappoint. Be prepared to queue for a while (~15min in my experience), and it is certainly worth the short wait. Heard that their fish and chips is really good, but I haven't tried it yet. Will certainly try it in future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cDZfazRRRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,1,"One of the waiter stood so close and knocked me without apologising. The chair was wet, had to swap a clean one.
Affordable with below average food.
Raspberry drink should be removed from Menu.
Plating needs additional training. Plate was so big that two of it took the whole table space.
Utensils full of water marks and some stubborn food stains.

Chicken was dry, salad with citrus dressing a very safe approach.
Pork heavily covered with black pepper, could season it better.

Difficult to decipher why the waitress kept wanting to clear the plates while we are still on the dishes.

Asked for bill twice (was off peak) and the waitress told us it's paid. Out of integrity I asked the third time.
Billed and never would I dine here again.

Not recommended. Dine at your own risk."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOEpXZk9REAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Limited tables available be prepared to  queue up and wait during dinner peak hour. Waitress are friendly and don't feel pressured to order fast and get on with life. Tried their signature crispy chicken cutlet, very crispy and nice, not oily too. The corn cob is a little soft and felt overdone but still alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHAzeGd3RRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,Being here few rounds for some dinner. Serving size was good. Food is good too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dXZhN2dnRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,"This is one of Collin's' more consistent outlets, taste-wise. For the price, I'd head to El Carbon a few blocks away though, coz the sauces and dressing are more or less the same and service is just a-ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc01fM3FRRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,2,"Horrible experience with their membership system. My friend and i each of us apply as their member to enjoy the 10% discount plus $20 offset after we heard that we can split the bill and enjoy the discount and offset.

When we bill, the manager told us the system got problem splitting the bill so we only can use one member account.

Would recommend if anyone want to enjoy the benefit ask them split the bill first before signing up. You need pay through paypal first

Will come back again as i still got $20 worth of points to use. Overall the food is nice for the price but service can be better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z0x6TGhBRRAB,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,2,So-so food but service was good
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LUlibFl3EAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,3,Portin is good. Food tastes ok. Fried squid a bit too hard to chew.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdU5mM1VnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,"Good grills with affordable prices. Their staff were all very friendly and helpful which made the dining experience all the more better. The cheese pizza was not bad too, with its crispy crust. Only drawback was that the place was quite noisy during peak hours. Prepare to queue too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRLXEzdkRnEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,4,Was there for lunch. Good and fast service. Staff was friendly and food was delicious. Mainly western Italian food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMWFTVktBEAE,COLLIN’S® @ Jubilee Square,5,Great place to enjoy Western food. Nice and cozy environment.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazdhVklREAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"Really agree the chicken cutlet is one of the best. It’s crispy n well flavoured.

Fish n chips is not bad but chicken cutlet really much better

Really have the old school no frills n yet good tasting. It’s quite cheap at $5-6 though portion is avg size. Big eaters need to add on.

Highly recommend to try"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPd3FUb0VREAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,Love the chicken chop and cutlet. The mushroom sauce is heavenly with thinly cut fries. This food is such nostalgia and has been my old school western go to place. Shout out to all who is staying near by to give it a shot if u have not! Friendly and humorous stall owners that will brighten up your day too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxZ2ZxSVRnEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,4,"Old school taste, old school straight talking, bit actually friendly, auntie. We are taking deep fries chicken, cutlets, grilled meat, canned beans, fried buns and fries. Classic Straits style 'western' food food the 70s. It looks like the stall has been around that long too.

Maybe ask them not to fry the bun though. Unless you can lower your cholesterol at will."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1blpUV0JnEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"my #1 spot for chicken cutlet rice. auntie has always kept the price low at $3.80 and sizeable portion since i was in poly and now in uni. now got option for upsize since i brought my boyfriend hahaha.

its true to describe it as old school taste! my mum likes to buy the chicken wings that is comparable to arnolds chicken. still recommend the cutlet rice over anything!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5M1BqajlnRRAB,Clementi 308 Western Food,4,"This stall sells street-style western food and their chicken chop is one of the favorites here. The chicken chop, was lean yet tender enough, retaining its tasty juices. It was topped with their custom made mushroom sauce, which is addictive, super delicious and fragrant.

Fish and Chips at $5.50, you will get 2 crispy fish fillets, coleslaw, baked beans and a fried bun. The fillets were crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted great and old school.

Fried Chicken Cutlet at $5.50 too, was a no frill, old school type of western food.  Freshly deep fried in a wok of hot oil upon order and served immediately with the sides. The cutlet has a thin, golden exterior crust which was exceptionally crispy, and the meat was tenderly and juicy.

It brings back wonderful childhood memories. Kudos to the stall owners and hope they keep this old-school western food tradition going on."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOHNxMTJBRRAB,Clementi 308 Western Food,3,The food does not live up to the reviews. Tried the chicken cutlet - taste and portion average. Not sure why people like the fried buns as it was oily. Not impressed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbk5tYmZREAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"Nostalgic! Still as good as ever 20 years ago and  now!!! Back then my friend and I, we were really sad when we found out that the clementi stall no longer existed. Have been trying to find out if they were closed for good/relocated until in the recent years, my friend saw a fb post and found out they have relocated to AMK. Imagine how happy we were. Just last week we dropped by, had some fries while reminiscing the good old days and dabao chicken chop, fish & chips, spring chicken. Everything was delish and I already can't wait till my next visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbklpVkZnEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"Chicken Cutlet which you can't taste anywhere else in SG.
The magic is in the skin.
It has an alluring, smokey crunch in the skin, and will leave you wanting more.
Have it with their butter rice, and you'll find a match in heaven.

Residents who lives or lived in Clementi or Sunset Way will recognize the stall owner right away.
With his waxy and slick hair combed all the way back, you will also be struck by nostalgia as the aroma and taste of that familiar cutlet bring you back memories of the past.

The Chicken Chop is excellent too!
That is if you can decide which one you want to fill your tummy with."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4dkpDbFd3EAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"Used to eat there when still in Clementi when i was in Poly

Then they closed down and search high and low for them.

Sad to see the halal is no more. Wished they can make it halal again. Their spring chicken is the best. Comparable to Arnold's.

Their chicken cutlet also one of the best I've tasted. Fond memories.

I think the father passed away. The son take over.

Uncle, make halal leh. I miss your food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGUtQ0p3EAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,Food is really nice and will recommend their chicken cutlet. The owners are really friendly people as well. Been patronising this stall since their original stall in clementi.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjdjhiZE9BEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,1,"Lady Boss is menopausal. Or maybe woke up on the wrong side of bed. Bad lousy attitude, and refused to give more chilli packs when we requested. Fries were too salty and dry. Disappointing, not worth the calories. Will never patronize again.

Now with this covid situation, hope they close shop better if want to continue service and quality like this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOXUzbVVnEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"$4.50 for chicken chop, very affordable"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNaXBQaHhnRRAB,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"The Auntie who took down order and serve food, she is super friendly. My Family loves her friendly character and we make like a go to makan to her shop!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLazd6RXlRRRAB,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,"Definitely the cheapest in the Bishan-AMK area. Quantity was adequate. Taste was above average.
The lady from the stall is pleasant and friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM3RXZlhREAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,5,Extremely tasty old school western food with fried buns included! Food is very affordable and the Aunty serving was super nice 🌻🌻🌻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDX1BmNWVBEAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,4,Juicy tender chicken chop! Amazing! Fries were a little over fried tho.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMmZMcVZREAE,Clementi 308 Western Food,4,"(Translated by Google) The crispy fried chicken is delicious!

(Original)
脆脆的炸鸡，蛮好吃!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzlxVEdREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Had a enjoyable lunch here. Ordering system was easy and food was served in a fast speed.
Took the lunch set with a drink, upgrade soup and upgrade dessert.
All the foods are standard and tasty but not superb. Lobster bisque was average. T bone steak was good but i got a medium well close to well done although I ordered for medium, a bit disappointed for this. The orea cheese cake was good.

Overall the food price considers to be at a slightly higher average, unless the food is super delicious. It's still a good place if you don't know what to eat as they serve quite a big range of food varieties."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdmFMTW1nRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Came here using the Great Eastern rewards 1-1 special promo for my birthday month and it was truly a happy experience. Slipper lobster and pasta is really yummy!! The hulk mocktail (taste like green apple) was very fragrant and refreshing as well… The staffs (sharlene, etc) here were friendly and wide food selection to choose from. There’s a clean washroom in their restaurant.. We also ordered using 1-1 (2-5pm) promo from Jack’s place fish&chips and steak&chicken combo. Overall it was a nice place to chill and dine, will be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bThfSzdnRRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Came for a birthday celebration. This place brings back all the memories.
Set lunches are value for money.
Love the mushroom soup and garlic bread which were the mainstays since many many years ago
Had the chicken and steak which came on a sizzling plate w baked potato and long beans as sides.
Baked potato was delish w the sour cream , bacon condiments"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHFyMnV3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Table wasn't properly cleaned when we sat down.
Had to request for staff to help us clean it.
When our meals came, we also had to specially request for staff to put the sour cream topping on the baked potato. But I guess they were short-staffed.
Quality of food; seems to have dropped over the years. But I like the fact that the ribeye was a rather good cut, not too fatty/chewy. Though the blood and sauce and oil mixed together wasn't a very pleasant sight.
Too expensive, would only come occasionally."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOTluOFp3EAE,Jack's Place,4,"It has been a long since I was last here and the food seems to have gotten better, at least in my experience. Forgot to take pics of the other items we had but the steak was great! Love it that it's served on a hot plate and the steak was not too tough even though we had it medium. Bill came up to $194 for 7 pax with a 1-for-1 main course set."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPamF1dzlRRRAB,Jack's Place,2,"Had the 1 for 1 deal. Chicken chop was nicely seasoned & tender, while the baked potato with sour cream & bacon bits were pretty yummy too. Hard to fault at this price. Lost a star due to dated & old furniture. But tasty food comes first of course.

Sadly on our 3rd visit on 12 July, the sizzling hot plate was no longer sizzling, and food was served lukewarm only. Wife couldn't even finish her plate, which she usually can. What a letdown that standards have dropped so quickly. Dropped to 2 stars from 4."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOV9PYmx3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"The Lobster Thermidor was very well cooked: The salad was fresh and the butter rice was flavorful. The amount of cheese and cream on the lobster was generous and was delicious with the lobster meat.

Jack's Special steak was also great except it was slightly overcooked from what we wanted.

Atmosphere-wise the place was quite loud so don't expect a cosy quiet experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbzhTRHJ3RRAB,Jack's Place,2,"System glitched and doubled order a dish for us, causing some awkwardness when the extra dish came.. 😨😨

Steak was as so-so as I remembered… not recommended for the price, though the fish and chips and chicken were ok.

Overall lighting was dark and made the place seem old and run-down, although it being old is very much true.

Btw, the pasta was some next level dry and weird. Don’t recommend to try unless you want to reminisce days during outfield when you’re eating the infamous pasta ration pack 😰😰😥😰"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdVktUFl3EAE,Jack's Place,3,"Food Is not bad but the waiting time for the food are rather long after you scan through their barcode and order the food,  you have to wait around 30mins,  I have made prior seat reservations for 2 pax at 7pm and got in to order the food and food came around 740pm.

The mashed potato sauce also taste very normal,  nothing fantastic. The Vegetables were very dry and hard to chew too (tasteless)

What upsets me most is that they no longer have the fish n chips menu that I always ordered,  the current food that they are having on the menu also taste normal.. Not really fantastic like before.  I won't give a full 5 star for this place anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMVBPdXZBRRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Beef Steak (SGD $14 / $25) @ Jack's Place.
.
Founded in 1966 by Jack Hunt and subsequently expanded by Say Lip Hai from 1974 onwards, this old-time casual steakhouse was once ridiculed for selling 'up-market' Western fare in heartland HDB locations.
.
Seniors may well recall those times in the early 1980s, when a set meal here - consisting of a soup, sirloin steak, salad, baked potato, fruit cocktail, and coffee/tea, cost just SGD $5.20..... at a time when a typical meal was less than SGD $2.
.
These days, their steaks remain as good as before, grilled to your requested doneness, served sizzling on a hot plate. The beef ribeye is juicy and tender, with a satisfying light chew, and robust meaty savoury salty flavour.
.
The accompanying boiled vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrot) have bright vegetal sweet flavour, while the soft baked potato with starchy sweet notes has old-school toppings served tableside - rich sour cream, crisp spring onions, chewy bacon bits. Filling.
.
They also specialise in the tenderloin cut, with 1 option being an eye-catching tableside flambe."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X3VmRHpnRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"It has been 3 years since I last visited Jack's place Ang Mo Kio branch. Love the tenderloin well-done texture. Comes in a set with oreo cheesecake but lobster bisque and cake standard has dropped. The lobster bisque does not taste lobster, the oreo cheesecake is not as good as other retailers cheesecake. Overall acceptable. As a cheesecake lover, i have tried so many places but given the price of the set meal, consider acceptable, not fantastic. The asparagus look pathetic."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbjdDLVVREAE,Jack's Place,5,"The beef striplon is quite good. But i ordered medium rare but came medium. Supposed to minus 1 star from it. But the portion and balanced set meal has made it up. As for the lobster aglio oilo, was just very much average. But Will definitely visit again with the wide range of beef sets."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaXNycGl3RRAB,Jack's Place,3,"My wife and I went there for the national day promo. Two mains , half dozen oysters and two durian puffs for 56++.

It was decent. We loved the steaks like usual. The oysters were pleasant. My wife didn't like the sauce on it. But the puffs were warm for some odd reason."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMjZ5U0VnEAE,Jack's Place,3,"The Set is good portions for two pax, but prawns were very hard & Sweet corn was difficult to chew, preferred baked potatoes but was not allowed to change. Prefer more green veges instead of big pieces sweet corn that's difficult to chew."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eE9mTzF3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"the waiters and waitresses were kind, and the sirloin steak was good, even though it was abit more 'medium well' than 'medium rare' ':D but still very good food, definitely would come back anytime!:)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eGNEdDhnRRAB,Jack's Place,4,Ordered the combo mixed grill which is one of their signature dish. Was disappointed that the dessert I wanted was not available due to a late delivery by their supplier. But overall am satisfied with the food quality. Ample public parking but need to walk a short distance. The restaurant is also quite spacious.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXUycURBEAE,Jack's Place,2,"Went on Sunday 6.30pm, but was informed that the 250g ribeye is not available only 180g left, banana split has blackened refrigerated bananas and could not be served, we had to remind them to serve the wine that we ordered. They accidentally added a $25 takeaway item to my table and she didn't seem to believe me when I said we didn't order it. She even asked others from my table if they ordered and refused to take it off the bill until another server told her it was for another table. The restaurant was not even full. Quite disappointing experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMkl1U3hnRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Oysters were fresh, very worth the quality. Delicious!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhNHMtQ2R3EAE,Jack's Place,5,"My go-to place if I would like to have something nice but still affordable.

The staffs in this branch are really friendly. The aunties and uncles were working here for many years. I hope this place can survive this covid situation.

I usually ordered steak here, and personally I found their steak is one of the best in Singapore. The meat retain the juiciness of the meat. It is also tender.

Expected damage would be around 25-35 per pax (depending what you ordered). They offer lunch set menu which is super affordable and worth the value. You can check on their website."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdDV5eW13RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"2person lunch at $88..one platter($16), 2 main dish($22x2), 2 soup($6.90x2 they forget to serve the desert,we also forget there's a desert and we left)...food quality is not bad, price is also acceptable. But next time come after 2.30pm they have 1for1 free main dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNFlLU19nRRAB,Jack's Place,5,Very lovely peaceful place with delicious food to relax and eat. Manager Amy is the current manager managing the restaurant with her fellow staffs. Her staffs and herself really do their level best to satisfy majority customers. Keep it up. All the best.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybzdLc1JBEAE,Jack's Place,4,"Dinner ribeye steak was good.
The potatoes are the same as always.
Vegetables has improved though, tastes better now.

4 stars as the online ordering system doesn't seem to update the wait staff of the drinks, and the food came first. It was solve when we asked for our drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaC1HYk1REAE,Jack's Place,3,The floor manager look like you own him money. He would do his own things and let customer wait at the counter waiting to be seated even though there is empty space. He could have let customer sit down 1st and look at the menu 1st. The cashier counter also look messy and look very unpleasant for a restaurant. The place filled up with oil smell and your body will have the oil smell when you leave the place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a0xiNWFBEAE,Jack's Place,1,I am here at Jack's Place Ang Mo Kio branch to celebrate 2 of my friends' birthday & my own birthday.  The service is really bad here.  The staff are all busy & greeted us with a black face.  There is no service at all & they are charging 10% service charge.  They even charge 50 cents for water.  Very disappointing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d1B5d1Z3EAE,Jack's Place,5,"Was there with my family on a busy night around 9pm. All of us agree that service was fantastic! Thank you assistant manager Fernando and team 😃

1. Even before we were shown our seats, the lady service staff pre-empted that orders might take longer due to shortage of manpower. We didn't wait more than 10 min after our orders. That's more efficient than I mentally prepared for

2. E-menu showed certain bundled items as unavailable, but they were mostly available separately. Fernando patiently helped to take the orders and proceeded to serve our food. (Disclaimer: We took quite a long while to decide)

3. Service staff was able to acknowledge our request for help with a simple hand gesture while continuing to serve another table, instead of simply ignoring us.

4. We stayed till closing and all the staff were cordial throughout without ""black faces"" or veiled sarcastic comments.

Kudos to the team!

Sidenote: One improvement that can be made is to the e-menu.
Root beer float was marked unavailable, but root beer and coke float were both available.
Value set was marked as sold out even though it is available on public holidays, but the soup and drinks were available separately."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDb0tmT0hnEAE,Jack's Place,2,"Call if a stroke of bad luck when most of the reviews I'm reading are positive. My food was terrible. My beef was done to medium when I requested for medium rare. The curly truffle fries were over fried, something I never expected any establishments to get wrong, especially one that has been around for the longest time. The iced lemon tea was sweet beyond honey.

The only 2 that were good and edible were the slab of salmon and the ice cream, which I believe is outsourced.

Staff were a hit and miss. Some were extremely polite and hospitable, while some just ignored you like you're transparent.

Not returning for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOU9mQUdREAE,Jack's Place,5,"My Family tradition since young to celebrate occasions at this particular outlet. Family friendly experience is consistent thru the decades.

Though nowadays there many new fancy places that served steak, glad that Jack’s place standards manage to stood the test of time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c2I3NDVnRRAB,Jack's Place,5,Always good value for money. Family place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdk9fbWV3EAE,Jack's Place,3,"The escargot was average, the chicken chop and fire steak was slightly disappointing. The meat could be cooked to a better consistency and the sauce was not to my liking. However the bake potato was good. Given the food quality I would prefer other options."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OVphYlRREAE,Jack's Place,4,"Was here on 2 Aug 2022. This place has been here since early 90s if I remember correctly.

Weekday 2pm I wards this place is very quiet to have a good meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDN3BfWEFREAE,Jack's Place,1,"Food was below average. Had the chicken soup which was bland; garlic bread was ok. Steak was tasteless as well; though to be fair the meat was done to medium rare as per my request. Dessert was chocolate cake that wasn’t great.

I won’t be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxOTRLbnlRRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"The best thing about this restaurant is the staff's service.  I've always experienced good service from the staff at Jack's Place AMK when dining in, or taking away.  I hope the management takes note of this and keep their staff in these difficult times."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMXVhdXB3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Went to AMK Jack’s Place during Christmas Eve night at 7pm. There was only two groups in front of us in the “walk-in queue”. There was a longer line at the “reservation queue” and people had to wait despite having made their reservation. Waited for slightly more than 30 minutes before we got our table. There was only a fix Christmas menu for us to order from (but you can order the appetisers). The service was smooth and staff were friendly & pleasant. The food was of quality as well & didnt had to wait too long before our food was served. Overall, a good experience on a busy Christmas Eve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bmR6Nm53RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Their healthier choice teriyaki chicken with brown rice is not bad ($9.90++). Golden wings, which came with a side of coleslaw was quite good too. Service could be abit more attentive and responsive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2QtaGp3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Been coming here since young, food still tastes good, potato in a jacket still tastes as good as before. My parents still hold fond memories of this place - the deco (which includes the Christmas mugs they use for their Christmas lunches)

Food service was a little slow in my recent visit.

However, food portion did get smaller. Dad ordered the chicken and mum ordered the chicken and fish (for a dollar more). Dad’s chicken portion was actually smaller than mum’s.

TLDR: food is still great, food portion got smaller and perhaps pricier too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJakpiNkZREAE,Jack's Place,4,"I found the meal to be satisfactory, and their potato with sour cream to be delicious as usual. The restaurant was crowded during lunch, but I found the staff to be attentive and responsive.

Perhaps a downside is that the soup was a bit plain, but no major complaints other than that."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3OVA3OWh3RRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Very polite and helpful staff. Food was decent. Game chicken was moist and juicy, even the breast meat (and I'm normally wary of eating chicken breast because it usually comes overcooked). Truffle fries were good. My sister's fish and chips turned out pretty well too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDb1lfU2hRRRAB,Jack's Place,1,"I am actually skeptical to visit them again but since my agent gave me a voucher, I'll use it.  The steak, as with my past experience, was tough and hard to cut (asked for medium).  Soup and the gravies are all too salty.  Dessert is a very small scoop of ice cream, yes the scoop is smaller than usual.  Will not visit anymore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleGFHUjJRRRAB,Jack's Place,1,"Bad service, very bad service from the lady staff by the name starting with 'S'..

Went for lunch with my mum but she was greeted and served rudely by S.

Food standard has dropped greatly. Would rather eat elsewhere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcU5XcGN3EAE,Jack's Place,5,Came here since last visited Jack’s Place a few years ago. It is one of the old branch where it had its standalone restaurant. Order the chicken chop in hotplate and served with their signature potato with servings.  Below are the pictures of other dish such as salmon and curly onion fries
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNHM2MUR3EAE,Jack's Place,4,"Good measure of social distancing with tables well spaced out. We tried the breaded fish & chips and lamb chops which were nice. Cream cake on sale near the counters are old school styled.

They ran out of mango gelato which perhaps can be managed if stocks are planned earlier in advance because ice cream usually have a longer shelf life"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbEpLaEV3EAE,Jack's Place,3,"Been eons since I've stepped into this pre-loaded eatery and now rekindled (I've joined their memebership), not because of vouchers but the meals are value for money, and if like me, you like a little nostalgia from time to time, this is one the places. Try their lunch sets, fast serving and decent portions with no overkill. I had mine in AMK. Upgrade to bisque soup for a change. Come here for a quiet anniversary or dates.  As their slogan says, it's steak and more..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdzhHT1FBEAE,Jack's Place,4,Tried their off peak hour 1 for 1 deal. And it was ok. Food portion was huge. The doneness of the beef was overcooked when we ordered medium rare. The chicken was marinated well and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbnFYWi1nRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"5 stars given for the excellent service provided. Service staff did inform us of a possible 10min wait time (was a Sat) but before 10mins they led us to use the VIP room instead. They were quick to provide utensils for my baby and food came relatively quick even though it was full house. Food from Jacks place was not as good as before, speaking from a regular since I was a kid. For example, the type of potato is not as fluffy and sweet that I recall and the boiled veges are quite tasteless. Still love their tea with milk and satisfied with the meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa3RuOVlREAE,Jack's Place,5,a bit slow on the service though but the food is still great !
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNXBfaTVRRRAB,Jack's Place,5,"Had a nice lunch there on Wednesday. Ordered the steak lunch meal, fish lunch meal and seafood baked rice student meal. Steak was cooked correctly as ordered, fish was fresh. Baked rice portion was huge even for student meal and comes with plenty of prawns and calamari."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cVBlMDl3RRAB,Jack's Place,4,"Overall, they still retain the old school western taste...it’s a must to drink their Kopi if you are a Kopi lover! 😉"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd0tpX2FnEAE,Jack's Place,3,"Ordered their chicken and mushroom Alfredo, the chicken tasted ""old"" and hard.

Guess this should be remove from menu"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc09hS1RBEAE,Jack's Place,4,Big & spacious restaurant. Staff are helpful & patient. On weekdays from 1430hrs till 1700hrs they offer 1-for-1 meals which is value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdzRpeVpREAE,Jack's Place,5,Was served by Amy and Sharlene and it was an amazing afternoon at Jack’s Place! Thank you both for your kindness and positive attitude towards us on a busy Saturday afternoon. ☺️
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNnR1Tlh3EAE,Mad Charcoal,2,"Perhaps our taste palette have changed.. these American style barbeques just don't satisfy anymore.

The lamb shoulder for example, I'll have the Chinese style ones from 刘大妈 anytime.

As for the beef brisket, I can't quite say it was 油而不腻, for it left behind such a greasy sensation. Even for the taste - we asked for salt and pepper half way through the meal.

So, I think we'll have our BBQ meat fixes with the Chinese joints."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtemZpdkV3EAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Good value and high bbq quality with meats smoked well! Ordered p1 platter and enjoyed the chicken and pork belly. Sides like the mashed potato were yummy as well. Also special mention for the octopus which I enjoyed, given I'm not a fan of tako. Accompanying sauces made the meats even more yummy. kudos to the friendly boss kelvin :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaXZDU1dnEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"My favourite western food at cheap affordable prices! Their meats are always well charred and moist. I love the beef brisket the most but the last time round, the beef brisket was out of stock. Nevertheless, the chicken chop is delicious too. I especially enjoy the ratatouille as a side dish which is rarely seen in other western stalls. Will always eat again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNXJEZnpnRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Oh man, this is seriously yummy and super worth travelling down to an industrial area for. Love the smoky flavours, tender meats, big portions, and superb seasoning. Price is very reasonable.

The P1 platter is to die for: it has pork, beef and chicken, and the interesting chili sauce goes well with the meats (very spicy though so don't dip too much lol).

As for the sides, the ratatouille was rather average but still hearty, and the garlic fries were good enough even without dipping into sauces.

We're planning to go down again or order delivery for house dinner parties next time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaDZES2pRRRAB,Mad Charcoal,4,"A long wait for food on a weekday evening but it was worth it as I had gained an appetite by then. The chicken was flavoured well and grilled with a slight char. The generous side dish of ratatouille was hearty and made up for the wait.
—-
Came back another time and ordered takeaway. Ordered the grilled fish of the day (sea bass) and beef brisket. The fish was fresh and the beef was tender and the beef fat melts in the mouth. Order the mash, it’s really yum. 👍🏼

Food deserves 5 ⭐️, but be prepared to wait."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb0tfTlVnEAE,Mad Charcoal,4,The meats were tender and had some smokey flavour. My preference is the chicken. Beef was alright but I think another cut may have been better as smoked. Still quite an impressive little joint. Oysters were nice too. Overall good value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHeC1MZ053EAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Hidden gem among the industrial area. Parking is easy. Ordered beef brisket (with mash potato), pork belly (with garlic fries) and mad spice chicken (with ratatouille). Pork was well done, no gamey smell, flavor was just right. Beef  brisket was well seasoned but I feel it’s abit too dry. Chicken had the strongest flavor, charred with crispy skin. Perhaps some of the charred can be removed first because it tasted bitter. Price was very reasonable. Worth a try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa05QcTBnRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Amazing BBQ food! Reasonably priced and really tasty.

Ordered a platter combo ($25) that came with 2 sides.

Definitely worth dropping by."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLXVYU3lnRRAB,Mad Charcoal,2,"Should have read the latest reviews before going. Used to visit this place a lot before its temporary closure. Standard has really dropped. The beef brisket is dry and doesn't taste great. The cheeseburger bun and patty are burnt to  the extent that they leave a bitter after taste. Only the fries is nice. The big guy (not the boss) taking my order doesn't look keen to work there, which is obvious based on how the food turn out. Don't think will come back again unless the quality improves."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdWJXTWJ3EAE,Mad Charcoal,4,"On my first visit here, tried the lamb 🐑 shoulder with sweet potatoes. You can smell and taste the charcoal 🙂 so pretty satisfied. Been back regularly. Great stuff. For sides I'd recommend the pasta or sweet potatoes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z0stTHZRRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Excellent joint, decent enough crowd on a friday night and it was easy to find seats. The meat platter A at $25 with 2 sides was value for money and a good way to try the various meats. I particularly liked the beef brisket and chicken. Sides (mash and ratatouille) were decent and came abit cold but owner kindly helped heat them up. I would say that the platter is probably good for 2 hungry girls but probably a little small for 2 hungry guys. Food came fairly quickly and as a nice touch, the coffee shop also serves beer on tap."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXN0kzTWN3EAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Tender and well grilled meat! Overall, the meat is great but just wished that the portion is slightly bigger. The aglio olio was a miss though. Maybe can pick other sides instead. Will still come back to try other stuff!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMTkyeDRBRRAB,Mad Charcoal,2,Maybe we got in on a bad day. Beef brisket was too chewy. Chicken was undercooked at some parts. Kitchen seemed a understaffed. Pasta was simple and great though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnJYZElREAE,Mad Charcoal,5,First time here and it was a really good experience. Really enjoyed their food and you can hardly find food stall using charcoal to cook their food. Will definitely come here again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NEx2R0d3EAE,Mad Charcoal,5,Great western gourmet food in a industrial estate food court. Close to restaurant quality but at food court price.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHZtRXVnRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,Pretty good food wish there was more salt. Will drop by if I ever pass by again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcC1XMFl3EAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Delicious! I love the chicken with the creamy sauce and pork belly, the sausage too. I was shocked with the ""side dishes"" as it is like a 1 meal already like the pasta. Will definitely come back again. Highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxanVDc1ZREAE,Mad Charcoal,2,It’s a bit below expectations based on the other strong reviews. Aglio olio was dished together with the chicken that came with a cream sauce - hmm? Pork belly was dry and the sweet sauce didn’t help to ease the flavor. There was nothing garlicy about the fries and it was rather salty. Egg was on point. I supposed the salad in garden greens would compliment the dish better.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5a3VEa0xnEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"The chicken here is really fantastic. Been coming back multiple times for it. The other meats, which I previously tried in the platter, were generally alright but nothing too special, with the beef brisket too fatty for my liking.

Overall, very delicious & well-presented food at a reasonable price. Quality is beyond expectation given how affordable their items are. Be sure to try their chicken!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMFp6V01REAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"The aglio olio and pork belly are so good taste, price also reasonable, cost me only $11:50"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEo3QV9RRRAB,Mad Charcoal,3,"Ordered the beef brisket which to my opinion was way TOO dry, really not up to a restaurant standard. The set was around $13, portion was ok, just the quality of the meat has been extremely disappointing.

Hubby tried the duck leg confit which was better although also overcooked. He had the pasta as the side, seasoning was not bad but again pasta was over cooked."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDUzRlRnEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Last ate here few years before Covid-19. Chanced again upon this place while collecting something from the office space here. Totally amazed by their beef brisket and pork belly, their sides also is really worth it as we ordered aglio olio pasta! Owner was also super pleasant and polite, had really good vibes here with good prices too! Will come again :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bzVfakVREAE,Mad Charcoal,3,"Unfortunately the quality has dropped significantly since it's re-opening

Used to be a frequent visitor back in 2020-2021 and the meats and pasta were great then, hence the three stars. However, we eagerly visited them upon hearing that it's re-opened but the pasta was average at best and meat was dry and that is considering an increase in price (which is justifiable in the current market but the drop in quality is not)

Hopefully it can go back to how great it used to be"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTejd6NlFBEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"An extremely satisfying dinner. The BBQ chicken is simply awesome...you can taste the smoke, as you bite into its tender and juicy meat.

As recommended by so many other reviewers, the whipped potato is really a must to try!

If there is a 6 star rating, I'll definately give 6 stars⭐"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNGVQZ2tBRRAB,Mad Charcoal,3,"Checked out this western stall that specialized in smoked meat at one of the coffeeshop of the industrial area in AMK street 62. I was there around 2pm and the lunch crowd has already died down. We order the meat platter for 2 which comes with 2 choices of sides (SGD$25), creamy pasta (SGD$5.50) and a Agilo olio (SGD$4.50).

Food didn’t take long to be served. The meat platter consisted of smoked brisket, pork belly and turkey.The sides were garlic mash and fries. Meat was average to be honest, Mash was bland, could do with more seasoning. Pasta was quite decent though, I liked the idea of having an onsen egg to go with the pasta.

Will I come all the way for this? Probably not. But in general, for the portion wise, it’s quite value for money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbWJDUTd3RRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Great char-broiled meats at such reasonable prices! I've been there a couple of times and their meats are always so nicely charred, flavourful yet tender. Took away their Mad Spiced Chicken($7.90) on an astonishing bed of shredded cabbage with sesame sauce and a Pork Belly with Ratatouille($8.90) and gotta say it tastes absolutely the same as savouring it right there. Give it a pass if you hate the taste of carcinogenic charred meat with a passion - coz they consistently get it right!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4czdpM1ZREAE,Mad Charcoal,4,"Surprised by the crowd at this quaint coffeeshop. Went on a weekday and the crowd started to pile in after 7pm.
Ordered a platter consisting of beef brisket, chicken and pork belly which comes with two sides. It was awesome! Perfect for a mini get together of 3 or even 4 if u order another side or something.
I loved the smoked beef briskets, plenty of fats in this one tho. Not for the faint of heart. The bbq chicken has a good flavour, well grilled I will say.
Pork belly was a bit on the dry side but I enjoyed the flavour it had.
We had two sides, the ratatouille and the garlic fries. The fries wasn’t too overpowering, with the garlic taste just showing through enough. Having the ratatouille with the meats balanced off the meal.
In all I’ll say it’s good food that should go into a good gathering. Oh the Coffeeshop serves Archipelago brews too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5d09IQXBnRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,Must try it yourself. Come early to avoid the crowd. Easy parking. If you love smoky favours of meat then this is the place you must visit. The soup and mashed potatoes by chef Kelvin is to die for. Also do call to check availability for their weekly flown in oysters from france. BTW the kopitiam also has draft 🍺 and delicious thai food too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMHB1U0dREAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Surprise find in a very quiet part of AMK. The mushroom soup & toast was comfort food after a long day, while the meat platter & sides are good to feed a hungry bunch 😊. Will be back to try the other beef items."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbllfd3RBRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Located in Link@AMK, lies a western stall with a rather extensive menu. Food is self-collected. Tried the Creamy Pasta which was $5.50 but sizeable - pretty affordable.

My only gripe is that the pasta comes with an egg and salad, and when the salad's sauce mixes with the cream in the pasta, it tastes sour and weird. Will prefer if the salad was served separately on the side. Hope to try their meaty stuff one day!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaV9HcDlBRRAB,Mad Charcoal,3,"Great value, big portions. Wish it was more juicy though.

We came around 3pm on a weekday. Ordered a platter that came with bbqed180gm-ish beef brisket, chicken chop thigh and two slabs of pork ribs.

Chicken and ribs were a little too dry. But love the brisket. Felt they were pre-cooked and reheated though.

Good thing they came with refreshly made bigass sides! Carbonara as sides!! House salad was tasty too.

All this for 26$ that feeds 2-3pax!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cGFUZWR3EAE,Mad Charcoal,3,"There were only 2 pieces of pork ribs given for a $18 spanish pork ribs set… i finished the meat in 2 bites.

Fish was good and portion was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdzlHVUFREAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"Stumbled on this little stall (located in Orange Point) in this industry park when googling for makan places. It has indeed lived up to its name for the food is charcoal grill. Most of the meat has been sous vide prior to grilling which eventually shorten the waiting time. Taste has been enhanced by the burning charcoal grill. It allow the customer to choose different side such as linguine (with various sauces) or garlic fries. Visited the stall on a Sat evening 6PM, and waiting time is about 10 to 15mins. Service is swift and the staff is polite as well. Price is pretty reasonable. Will visit this stall again for sure."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MzZlM1lBEAE,Mad Charcoal,2,"Fell way below my expectation but has the potential to be great if some changes are made.
The pork ribs were cooked just right and had plenty of smokey flavour. What let it down was the amount of bbq sauce - too little and barely having any sweetness. The meat marination also needs work. It tasted very flat. Just smoky and very salty with not much other flavour to give it depth so it got sickening quite quickly. Ratatouille was microwaved - film on the sauce and some parts of the dish were piping hot while other parts were not even warm. It marred the experience of an otherwise pretty decent side dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeE1fQmd3RRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Surprisingly tender and succulent lamb ribs with smokey vibes. The drinks stall, which I understand is owned by the same owner, carries Archipelago Brewery creations that would complement the smokey bbq meats perfectly. An excellent gem hidden in an industrial estate!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcHNDdlNREAE,Mad Charcoal,4,"Had the platter with 3 meats (lamb, beef & pork) and they were all delicious but i must say the lamb pale to comparison with the other 2 (and it’s more expensive). The pasta was cooked to al dente although I feel the flavour can be stronger abit (it’s only $5.50 by the way). This meal costed us about $37.50 but the portion was quite generous (definitely enough for 2) and there are 2 side dishes that came with the platter (we had mash potato and sweet Potato). Overall quite worth the price and the food are good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eU4tbUpREAE,Mad Charcoal,4,One of the best BBQ meat in Singapore (My opinion). Love the salad and pasta because of the well marriage of flavors 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4dGF2R2dRRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Tried the Beef Brisket with aglio olio.
Beef Brisket was soft and tender with good grilled flavour.

downside was that it is quite oily which doused the spaghetti as well, the amount of fat to meat content is pretty high but hard to complain as it’s brisket and further, at this price point.

(Pardon me for the photo of the half eaten brisket, it was difficult to resist tucking in immediately)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dE0zMzdBRRAB,Mad Charcoal,1,"Used to be an office go to; quality has significantly deteriorated. Brisket is chewy and dry, used to be succulent and melts in your mouth.

Disappointed, probably won't visit again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ejdETDJ3RRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Happy with generous portion salad bowl choice with grilled chicken for lunch. Was able to finished all the food as the salad bowl paired off nicely with grilled chicken and wasabi taste paste. The boss of the stall is friendly too.

Will come back if around link@amk again

#salad bowl #characol #grillchicken #coffeeshop"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eGV6bXpRRRAB,Mad Charcoal,3,"Had the aglio olio but it was unfortunately super salty. The taste was still not too bad i guess, if I ignore the salt, and the price of $4.50 is pretty affordable for a plate of aglio olio. The egg is also a really nice touch! They just gotta take it easy with salting the dish it'll be alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwMXRLT3N3RRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,"Without recommendation from a friend, I would have missed this gem - that would have been awful. Located in the industrial corner of the Ang Mo Kio Estate , which mostly are a ghost town after office hours, Mad Charcoal chose to open the coffeeshop into the late (10pm, I heard). Some standard dishes and the other items were created to what the freshest the market has to offer that day - which will please all crowd that chose to slow down for the night. When I first visited, i saw only a few customers, on a Saturday night!! From dismay, the mood swing quickly to a gastronomic excitement. Value-worth European Gourmet had us convinced, and we are sure that, most if not all blind-tested connoisseur  would place the gourmet to be from a posh restaurant. We were back another 2 days later with our child - it is that good. Now go try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeTVxa25nRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,Extremely nice and delicious western food. Prepared and cooked with charcoal caused the taste nice and something different. Price is reasonable and the food portion quite big.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTdWVHWFlnEAE,Mad Charcoal,1,"Had high expectations for this place, and ordered their Angus Steak for $35. Steak was greasy and overcooked — requested for medium rare, but got almost well done (see picture). Apparently their standards have dropped; went at 12pm when it was not yet crowded."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb1phcFpnEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"I want to start off by saying: generous and cooking done right!

I was actually on a hunt for good western nearby my place and happened to chance upon this hidden jewel inside this industrial area (yes its a pain to get to if you don't have a car!).

I had ordered the p1 platter combo (as shown in image) and my sides as ratatouille (yes shocking to find this on the menu in a kopitiam!) and mash potato. Not the best ratatouille i've had but its on par with your average french restaurant in singapore. Mash done right as it was creamy and smooth. Pork chop was crispy on the outside juicy on the inside with the fats perfectly cooked (which melts in your mouth if done right!). Great moist chicken with a smokey creamy sauce and finally, a BBQ glazed beef brisket. I was skeptical at first thinking it was average but this place totally caught me off guard and for $25, you can't find an alternative that gives this much food on a plate!. The chef was really nice as when I was collecting the dish he explained the different cuts off meats. The finale was when he finished the dish off by cracking peppercorns onto the main platter.

My only regrets here is that I got greedy and took a bite of everything, which caused me not to enjoy the chicken and pork as the smokiness from the brisket was overpowering. If I had to complain, the only thing would be to travel to this kopitiam. I would recommend people to drop by if you're in the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2VfUW5RRRAB,Mad Charcoal,5,Excellent western cuisine at affordable prices. The owner is friendly and welcoming. My family loved all our orders! Everything was fresh and done to perfection.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMjhPamFnEAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"I ordered pork belly. This shop really love up to their name, the pork belly actually had slight tinge of charred flavour and the fats of the pork belly is well rendered. They are also generous with the side dish. The price was ONLY $9.90 Definitely willing to try again. Regretted that I didn't order the other stuff there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteGFYN0hREAE,Mad Charcoal,5,"A diamond in the rough.

The best no-frills cheeseburger I've ever eaten.

The grilled brioche bun is amazing, and the beef is seasoned well (for those who are not into savoury foods, this is slightly on the salty side).

You can ask to separate the shredded raw cabbage so that the burger would be only cheese + patty + bun.

The other items on their menu are great too, such as the pork belly which has an amazing charred taste and the beef brisket (can be a little fatty sometimes, but the sauce is great)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMVp1UXNRRRAB,Mad Charcoal,3,"We opted for self pick up at a specific timing half a day in advance.
However, when I arrived and said that I'm here to pick up my food, they then began to cook.
Had to wait an additional 15-20mins for my food to be cooked which caused me to be late for a family dinner.

It would've been nice if they prepared and had the food cooked and ready to go by the timing given.

We ordered the P1 platter combo and the M9 spicy sausage.

The platter was decent but the chicken was pretty good.

Spicy sausages were nice too however, it didn't come with the mash potatoes as shown in the picture.

Overall, I'd say it's still a pretty decent meal!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcmUyQWFnEAE,Mad Charcoal,3,It's OK. Meat precooked and then heated over charcoal fire as some parts of my beef brisket meat were still cold when served. $9.90 for beef brisket with 1 side so relatively economical.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOVA3S0JnEAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"We had crispy chicken and rosemary lamb loin. Both good portion size, nice plating. Overall well executed western food and at reasonable prices!

Must try"

Chicken chop was nice, grilled to perfection but the sauce provided was too little. Fries were not bad, a little bland though. Salad was refreshing and crunchy. Mashed potato tasted like flour, bland and powdery. Service was alright."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXejd5NmdBRRAB,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"Tried their medium rare beef sirloin steak, is only $11.9, considered as one of the best western stall(kopitiam) in AMK area.

Their chicken steak/pork steak costs only $6.9, and they serve super generous portion!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydExfeklREAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"1st visit to the stall, tried pork chop (not much western food sells pork chop). It was tender and juicy. Great taste."

The sauce is great and the huge meat is tender. Comes with crispy waffle fries, salad and mashed potato. Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbUlhUXBBRRAB,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,Best western along amk Ave 10. Whenever I have graving for western will walk from Choon boon market over here just for their western.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbmMza1FREAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,4,"Opening hours is similar to restaurant timing as there is a break from 2.30pm to 5pm.

Pork tomahawk is only limited to 10 servings per day and they open from 11.15am. So if you go after lunch hours... hoping they can increase the par level.

Ordered chicken & pork chop. Pretty much like Collins but it's way much cheaper. Black pepper sauce is spicy and so is the alio olio. So do remind the counter staff if you are ordering for the kids. Overall its very nice and tasty. Meat is not dry and rather juicy. Serving is generous and value for money."

The Axe is a new western stall in the area. Definitely better than the one in 409 hawker center! Must try! Cheaper, bigger quantity, friendly staff, and definitely more delicious!

I ordered the Mexicano grilled chicken for $7.90. The chicken skin is crispy and you can tell it is grilled slowly with care, hence the 10 minute waiting time. The mashed potato gravy has black pepper and tastes yummy. The aglio olio is okay but very large portion even when I ask them for less. I chose salad over fries, but the lettuce is chopped roughly anyhow with too sweet dressing. Overall, very big portion and hearty and enjoyable. Worth!

The mexicano version has a lot of raw onions and cheese, I think buying the normal grilled chicken for $6.90 is even better.

Also check out their buff 招财猫 (lucky cat)!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cmFpY1Z3EAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"The juiciest pork tomahawk I have ever tasted.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhZ3FlY0NBEAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,2,I tried the famed Pork Tomahawk and was grossly disappointed….. I paid $16.90 for a piece of meat that was rather tough and tasteless. Overrated.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybDdYN0FREAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,3,"Not eating there often now after they change their side dish salad. Last time was fresh salad, now is those similar to KFC type. Yucks, I hope they change back."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTlmajJBRRAB,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,The food is not too bad but pretty disappointed that they changed their garden salad (unlike the ones they show in their menu) to typical coleslaw..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxN3UzdndRRRAB,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"Went on a Monday 9pm, there was only a few people. Ordered the fish & chips which was $7. Here are some of my thoughts.

1) The fish and chips is Battered Fish! Which is not easy to find.

2) Yes the battered was pretty good. Considering that now is H.A. and only can dabao, the fish was still warm and crispy after 15mins. I guess it's because of the dabao box that they used.

3) The tatar sauce has a slightly heavier onion taste, which was good.

4) crinkle cut fries was well seasoned and the mash potatoes goes very nicely w the dish.

The only down side is that the fish is quite thin, they give 2 pieces, but it's really more like a dory fillet cut into half. But I got no issue with it cause it's only $7 :) Will be back again for sure!  Didn't manage to take a picture and drown it down cause it smells too good 🤣"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPakxMaC1BRRAB,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"I really like the Aglio Oglio here, will continue to try other food."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdk5Ta1JnEAE,The Axe Western 斧头帮,5,"Tried the pork chop fried rice - generous portion of meat that outlasted the rice 😂 pork chop was fatty and flavourful, and the fried rice was good too. Mashed potatoes and gravy was nice! Would prefer more options for accompanying sauce/gravy for the mains though. Prices are reasonable, even a little cheap for the amount and quality!

Waiting time (ordered at lunch) is a little long right now, but it's to be expected since it's just opened and the coffeeshop is popular for working crowd nearby."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5Z1BLTXpnRRAB,Western express,5,Super place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPak9MMThnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,3,"The service staff were very polite and helpful, restaurant vibe was good.

The food was... Interesting.
The mushroom soup is diluted and watery, there was very little mushroom taste.
Truffle fries came hot, there was some truffle oil smell but it was missing any truffle taste.
Same thing applied for the pork, ribs, sausage, chicken chop and steak. All of them were well cooked and the food texture was ok.

However, all of them didn't taste what they were suppose to taste like. The steak was slightly redeemable because of the sauce.
It's weird, this is the first time I've encountered this issue.

If you have to come and visit here, just get their beef dishes. For other Western food, there are several in the close vicinity that's better and cheaper."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZzZIdS1nRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Truly a gem hidden in the heartlands. Special shout out to the Rib-eye steak as well as the Home cured bacon thicks. The ribeye was cooked perfectly to medium-rare and had a very nicely charred crust. The bacon was full of flavor and the juices oozes out into your mouth.

Definitely worth the visit! Prices were decent for its quality as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMkxHd1dnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"Came on a Sat night and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of steak and value for money of this little gem tucked away in a housing estate. We had the platter to share which has 200g steak, 1/4 ribs, crispy chicken and sausages. Argentinean ribeye was delicious. Must be medium rare. The service is quick and food came out quickly. Don't forget about dessert as well. Definitely recommend for others to try this out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNWMzTU9REAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Amazingly good! The ribeye steak is the best, the staff is very friendly, I always feel like I am with friends when eating there. I have a serious steak addiction because of Steakgrill. Prices are also good, especially on the lunch menu. Make sure you book a table, as the place is always full. I really really recommend Steakgrill!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyekp1c09BEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,Frieds were crispy.  Chicken crispy outside but inside was on the dry side.  Beef good quality.  Sides were good.  Ice lemon tea quite diluted.  Service is slow but friendly.  Price reasonable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1czlyZGhBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Came to this place with the recommendation of a friend. Tried their rib eye and truffle fries. Its really good! The service staff were very attentive as well! Nice environment for enjoying food w friends!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dktDZ0hnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"Huge HDB carpark nearby if you drive, took a while to find our beef, service was quick and we had the $70 Double Ribeye steak 650g (Argentina/NZ) and includes two Sapporo Premium bottled and we opt for truffle fries, also tried their home cured bacon $10. We can’t be happier, both steaks were great. Highly recommended if you are tired of hawker fare"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbkppXzZnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,3,"Food is decent , the chef presentation is good n have their own style which is different. Price is good , portion is generous but I think they can work on their coffee when it comes to breakfast..other than that it's worth the time and money . Good job guys"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMHB1QnlnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"First time visiting this restaurant. Walked in and was told all tables fully booked, even when we were prepared to wait. So did an online booking and visited the restaurant the next day.

Ordered Ribeye and Home Cured Bacon Thick. Ribeye was juicy and nicely grilled. The Bacon Thick was excellent. Prices are very reasonable, no service charges nor GST. Will be back to try their other items."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla09TWGdBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,3,I feel it is really ok nia. Nothing i can shou about. It does taste a litte bit better than your average family steakhouse. Ordered medium came medium. Mac and cheese is alright. Ordered a set and mushroom soup was diluted and salty. Fish and chip should be good because it is served woth snapper but the whole piece dont hold well and it was a abit disasterous to eat it. The nett price is drawing point.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHR6eEdBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Back again to this nice cosy restaurant inthe heart of AMK. The steaks are juicy and done perfectly. Duck breast is yummy. Pork tenderloin fillet is nocely done.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eVllaVBnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"A rare find to find a great steak house in the heartlands. The staff here are so friendly, and service is rather prompt too. If you're stuck for choice, they wouldn't mind recommending what to eat. Another thing I like is that they're pet friendly, so pet owners feel free to bring your pups or cats along, as long as they're leashed.
Food here is pretty delicious too. I enjoy a good steak and the sides here are delectable. They have one of the better Mac and Cheese sides I've eaten compared to some other steakhouses. Definitely a bang for your buck considering the range they have here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bGNXY1lBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"Generally good food quality. The affogato is served with strawberry vanilla, my wife didn't like it but I'm fine. Good price value for neighborhood location. The truffle pork chop is genuinely grilled to excellent flavour and tenderness."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPOHFLMnJ3RRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Please try their mixed grilled is really value for money 😍 Foods is nice and the staffs is very nice also, please made reservations before you come, because always full house 😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWUtbjlnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"The steak was delicious and not too expensive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice as well and the service was top tier, they were very polite and friendly. I saw that some reviews had mention a long wait but I did not experience any problems in regards to the waiting time. Definitely worth a try and would go back there again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN0t1VVRnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Table reservation was made before HA, and Edwin was kind enough to notify and offer takeaway for the main event, which was the A5 Wagyu for 4 pax.

Pricing and order was clear and speedy, with care taken to ensure quality of food served. We ordered 1/2 rack of ribs and 720g A5, along with side dishes.

Packaging was done to ensure the best possible quality when served, and Edwin even offered to load the food to my car.

Impeecable service and taste! Will definitely visit again, be it for dine-in or takeaway.

Let's support our local businesses, those who take extreme pride in the service they provide!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eGNlZVpBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"nice cozy place to eat steak within the neighborhood area.

recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cnNTd0NnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,We always enjoy the steak and pasta here. The steak is accurately done to our liking and in our opinion value for money. Last night we had the different meat combi which allowed us to taste beef from different origins w/o breaking the bank. Service was friendly and good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bE51Ry1BRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"the bit chunks of mashed potatoes are to die for. well-grilled beef. tuna salad is so fresh. although we got it after our mains of steaks, it leaves us with a refreshing end. i also admire the small selection of alcoholic beverages, its giving living-room vibes. would love to kick off to their breakfast menu too.we’ll definitely  be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anZELXh3RRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Great value and quality western cuisine. We liked their ribeye steak, pork chops and bacon spaghetti. Can skip the bananas shake though. For those who prefer beer, they serve good beer at reasonable prices, all without the 10% service charges."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cVpEUHhRRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"I've been to the restaurant numerous times and the food has consistently been top-notch and absolutely delicious!! I really love that they are innovative and when you ask for recommendations, the staff is always fantastic with recommending me very tasty dishes 😋😋😋😋 It's the perfect place for a family dinner or gathering with friends. Thanks for the lovely experience, will definitely be back again!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMWZEYTZnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"Google steakhouse at AMK and this place popped up.

Not too bad for a steak within a HBD neighbourhood. We had the ribeye and NY sirloin steak, both were quite good considering the price was very reasonable.

The pull pork burger was equally tasty as well. Moist enough and with the cheese on it, not bad at all.

Onion rings and the affogato were alright. But the French fries were super crispy and it's like McDonald's curly fries except it's not curly 😂"
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3NadRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Mushroom soup slightly watery but tasted decent. Ribeye steak tasted great for its price and was nicely cooked. Fries were very crispy. Chocolate brownie was amazing. Would return again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycUxfN3pBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"We tried Ribeye steak and some other dishes. Yes, the taste is really splendid. Atmosphere is relaxing, pricing is not too expensive too. Service team is awesome, always trying their best to serve their customers."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeW9EWG1RRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,3,"Quite a nice spot nestled deep inside AMK Ave 10 blocks. Took us a while to find the place. Food is decently priced and lunch comes with free flow of iced lemon tea.

We tried a range of items and in general the burgers was good but the Cajun grilled chicken was a bit undercooked (pinkish).

Friendly wait staff…."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcWJ1SVhBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,Decent priced steak and taste good too. Love the pulled pork burger. The beer and cider are rather well priced at $6+ we will come back again. Last order at 8.30pm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWRmV2tnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"A hidden gem in the neighbourhood! Considering the quality of the food we get at the prices, it's very reasonable and worthwhile. Get the mac & cheese for sides - unlike the usual, obviously microwaved packed ones you eat at other western places, this will not leave you with regrets! The home cured bacon thicks were so good too, we came back for more!

Pork chops were tender so it wasn't hard for my grandma to chew on, and I enjoyed the cordon bleu as well :) if you have some more space for the pulled pork quesadillas, I recommend you getting a portion! We got them to go and had them for supper, still good!

Plus point: they're pets friendly (as long as you're sitting outdoors)! It's better to call in to inform the staff if you're bringing a pet, so they can keep the tables outside for you :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaEpUR2hnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Pretty tasty steak, had a ribeye for 20 sgd, price is net, there was no gst and service charge. Overall was well cooked and tasty steak, came with fries that were crispy, and some salad. Overall ambience is decent and comfy, was not crowded on a Saturday afternoon. They have pasta and grilled chicken at more affordable prices around 10 dollars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGM2UmFBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"The food was really good and the staff was super friendly!!! We had the Australian Wagyu platter, which was recommended by the staff and it was really tender and delicious. The only downside was the wait time, which was understandable as they have very limited seating and the tables were full when we came. Next time we will try the Double Ribeye platter, which was another recommendation by the staff. However, I suggest booking on their website or whatsapp them as walk ins may not guarantee a open table. The staff were nice enough to take our numbers and called us when they had an open table. Overall it was a 10/10 experience!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxOEtHTHlnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Awesome and delicious food at reasonable prices. Hidden place, sad to see it become too popular cause then we will need to queue haha. Support your local businesses!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ0otaE9nEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,A hidden gem in the AMK neighbourhood provides nice steak. The steak approximately 250g with a great thickness and worth for money. The grilled chicken also taste good and the portion of it was great.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1emN6MzZRRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Good food and service.
Small restaurant with ~10 tables
Not hifi, but neat and tidy with friendly staff"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNUlmTjVnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Good steak at affordable prices in a quiet HDB neighbourhood. The pork jowl is so tender with hint of apple. Reservation recommended.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bExPM2ZBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"a hidden gem in the heartlands. service was immaculate, hearty portion of well cooked steak of a good cut. second time patronising this outlet and I have all the praises for their consistency and value for money. super affordable wine and beer available too. Their goma tuna salad came with large chunks of fresh tuna in fresh veggies, it was delightful. Better than Astons, anyday."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcmEzRnNBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"Me and my partner had their truffle pork chop and that alone made us give this simple down to earth restaurant five stars. The meat was juicy, savoury, succulent and satisfying. Everything was on point. The onion rings were crunchy and perfect. Mac and cheese was delicious too. The only underwhelming thing was the strawberry smoothie, compared to the meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNmZIODJnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"@steakgrillsg is a cosy restaurant that serve delicious and affordable cuisine.😋😊

Let's see what we have here:

1. Quest fries S$9
Crispy fries served with in house cheese sauce, chicken and bacon bits.
Their fries is really good esp with the cheese sauce. 😋 their fries is crispy and fragrant. Must order. 👍
,.
2. Home cures bacon thicks
Thick cut belly strips that had been cured for days, smoked and then grilled
This is flavorful,best for people who like pork with more fats. I personally prefer their pork chops instead.

2. St Louis Rib 1/3 S$16
Applewood smoked ribs served with in house sauce
This ribs is tender with some fats and lean mix. Portion is so value for $.
,.
3.Ribeye 250g S$21
All time favorite with a good balance of fat and lean
( I don't eat beef, but my foodie friends like this)
,.
4.Prawn Arribiata S$15
With chilli, prawns and pomodoro. I like the pasta noodles it is spicy and tasty. I could finish the whole plate myself. 😋The prawn could be better though.
,.
5. Truffle Pork Chop S$16
Pork tenderloin grilled and topped with truffle cream sauce
I personally like this very much without dipping the sauce. It is lean meat yet not tough, very nicely marinated. I strongly recommend to order this 😋 love this.👍

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a2I3a0JBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,1,"Love the food here but the service is not great..... came at 8pm and waited for 10 + mins in front of the 'please wait to be seated' sign before a service staff approached us and said that they were full for the day and cannot accomodate us. they said that they thought we were browsing/takeaway so they didn't approach us which is... super passive???? we didn't want to flag them also because they looked super busy walking in and out serving people, and they also sat and attended to another group before us that was also waiting in line but they ignored us... anyway food is great though but come early/make a reservation and make sure to be forthcoming when you arrive because the staff is not 😬😬😬"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5N3BmRDZ3RRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"As we seldom eat beef, decided to try their fish, chicken and pasta. All were nicely cooked and seasoned, including the side dishes. Recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLa0kyTmlnRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,4,"This eating place is hidden in the Any Mo Jio HDB estate, and it has both air-conditioned and alfresco sitting. The meat platter is nice, especially the prepared beef, which is tender and juicy. The starter platter on the other hand is just average. The restaurant is overall good value for the food served."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNazd2OUh3EAE,Steakgrill Steak House,3,"Perfectly crispy fries and great service.

However the steak was chewy and more medium-well than medium-rare, and the mac and cheese just didn't taste good.

Nachos were bland, but the roast pork it came with was tasty. They don't really go well together though, it's not like they can be eaten together...

All in all would only come back for the fries."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aUo3MDFRRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"This place is great! Food is pretty good, large portion, for their prices it's 100%worth it. Highly recommend! It's best to make reservation💕"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Z292dGlBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"First visit, reached there after 2pm. Well grill and flavourful. Would visit again.  👍🏻

1"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eXEzeDJBRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Had NY Steak. It's yummy and affordable. We finished everything. We came back again for St Louis Ribs Half Rack. It's equally as good and sufficient for 2 people.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbE9qOVBREAE,Steakgrill Steak House,3,"Had a takeaway order though the place looks cosy for dine in.

Ordered the Cajun grilled chicken and truffle pork chop - would prefer the pork chop though i can’t really taste the truffle. Grilled chicken was pretty bland to be honest and the house salad portion is too little..and so is the proteins.

Sides as butter veg and onion rings which surprisingly taste better than the mains.

Unfortunately ribs ran out but would give it another chance next time. Hopefully the portions are bigger when dining in!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMXI3VlRnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,"A place that worth a try!

Except for their ‘Salsa’, personally I find their salsa tomatoes taste are too strong, otherwise overall staff and food is great.

Hopefully get to try their truffle pork chop during our next visit. 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NGJLNzZ3RRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,5,An Absolute Hidden Gem In e Neighbourhood I Would Say... e Food Is Great & Definitely Worth e Prices!! You'll Never Regret Trying... I'll Definitely Be Back Again~ 😋😋😋🍻🍻🍻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMktMb1dnEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,3,Below average food for above average price. Steak was not very nice and pork chop was tough  but i like the consistency. Brocoli was okay but abit msgish. Wine was veryyyy bad and dry and non nice at all. Was not a good pairing with the beef
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpOF95aVRBEAE,Steakgrill Steak House,4,Good food and value for money with entertainer or Burpple 1 for 1. No service charge and GST. Truffle pork chop and ribs were good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpODdfTTVRRRAB,Steakgrill Steak House,4,Portion is small... $14 for 3 pcs pork ribs. Not sure if this price reasonable but the taste is not bad.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMjZhSEVREAE,Steakgrill Steak House,5,Finally tried the Bacon Carbonara my colleagues always order. Wow... the generous portion of smoky carbon (more like char siew lor... so thick n juicy) stacked on top of creamy pasta is delicious! $9 for such quality! I also love Sausage Mushroom Pomodoro pasta as I’m more of tomato sauce person. Will keep returning! My dream combo would be this bacon with tomato base!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNjliTU1nEAE,Say Cheese,5,"Chanced upon Say Cheese when I was on the way to my grandma's house and decided to try for myself. Was looking for some drinks and the friendly staff recommended me Caramel Milk Tea ($4.50). I topped up $0.50 for cheese foam and the end result was amazing! The caramel wasn't too sweet, which was perfect and the cheese foam complemented the drink really well. Flavour was very balanced and you have the cheese after-taste which was better than I expected it would be :D they have mains on the menu as well, and I will definitely be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c2ZiOGN3EAE,Say Cheese,5,Their fish n chips yery value for money and taste great! The sides are curly fries.  I luv the lychee tea too❤️ A bit secluded spot
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM09qM2FBEAE,Say Cheese,5,"I love the carrot cake, traditional and not greasy at all. Well presented. It will be my new hangout."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NmZTVS1RRRAB,Say Cheese,5,love the food here looks like im gonna be  a regular hehehe. staffs are also nice n friendly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ME9ydUN3EAE,OMG Grill & Pizza,5,"Lovely place for grilled food. I recommend their Signature Grilled Chicken Diablo with Demi Glace. It usually comes with salad and normal fries for the 2 sides.

The owner let me try the Dirty Fries — fries with parmesan, nacho cheese and teriyaki sauce. I must say the triple combo is satisfying. Besides that, the chicken is well grilled and the balsamic vinegar is pretty good. I like the fact that I could ask them to separate the balsamic vinegar from the chicken.

Last of all, the salad is fine. It’s better than the generic coleslaw with that all too familiar factory-made sauce. The fresh vegetables delight me!

I will come again for sure. I want to try their pizza."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c0xfSW5RRRAB,OMG Grill & Pizza,5,"We chanced upon this stall when we were examining our dinner options in this area. While it was newly opened (for less than a month), the quality of food served surpassed our expectations.
We ordered salmon with fresh veg, truffle fries, nuggets (came with a small serving of veg), and a Hawaiian pizza.
The salmon and fries were delicious, nuggets tasted better than the ones you find at fast food outlets, and the pizza was soft and easy to chew, probably due to it being hand-stretched before being cooked.
Prices were reasonable considering the food quality and portions served.
Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2ZfeW5RRRAB,OMG Grill & Pizza,5,"Great western food in a cozy environment. We’ve come here for the pizza as its hand made and fresh out from the oven. As well as the carbonara turkey bacon and the fish and chips, great choice and fulfilling too!
Come and check it out! ✌🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHN3JfUFlnEAE,JWS Grille Factory,4,Super affordable and delicious thick beef patty! So much nicer than another nearby western food. Thumbs up. Returned for their single patty cos dbl is too much for me.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDg3WGlRRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,5,"Great food, one of the best spring chicken that I've tried, may have to wait a bit (10 - 15 minutes)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhcy1mb21BRRAB,JWS Grille Factory,1,"I order Grill platter take away with sides: coleslaw and sweet potato fries (had to pay extra $0.50). When I reach home, the set contain all the wrong sides, ie, whipped potato and corn broccoli (both I don’t eat). Paying extra and not getting what I ordered is really not the main issue. Spoiling my whole dinner experience was really upsetting. This will be the last time I dine with Jws."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNks3UTV3RRAB,JWS Grille Factory,1,Horrible experience... Last week take away black pepper pork chop reach home realise never give black pepper sauce... Today order coleslaw reach home realise is spoilt with foul smell...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcTV5c1lnEAE,JWS Grille Factory,1,"Do not be deceived by the displays talking about the lovely steaks they serve. The sirloin I just had is literally the driest, most rubbery medium rare I ever had. On some bites, I even wonder if this is some sort of bad mock meat. The only thing I could taste was the mushroom sauce. Be warned...

Edit 4 July 2020: We decided to give JWS another chance and ordered the chicken and broccoli spaghetti in marinara sauce. This is without a doubt the worst shaghetti we had in our collective lifes. Shame on the cook who so obviously doesn't care about his/her work."
