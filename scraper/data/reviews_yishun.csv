ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cklmdFh3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Located some distance away from the mrt. The omelette, fried rice and red wine chicken are good. The cold trotters wasn't to my liking as there was just much more skin than meat. Overall taste is reasonably good but nothing especially outstanding.

Price wise seems quite standard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbFk2UmtRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Make a reservation so that can save time in waiting.
Food is served very fast and swift.
Loves the fresh cockles with its lotsa garlic that is seasoned so well.
Sweet and Sour Pork is crispy and tasted great.
Steamed Sea Bass is Fresh and meat is tender.
Fried Toufu is so so soft and delicious.
The Xing Hua Bee Hoon and Lor Mee have that nostalgic taste.
Fried Yam is well crispy and soft.
Overall taste is like the Putien Restaurant and price is simply half of it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbDdiTC1RRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Quality of food is always there 😋 for the past 2 yrs. For 3/4 of us, we  ordered small size dishes and medium for noodles;  pretty good value for money.

Need to queue a while during Friday night dinner hours."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbU5YSU1BEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"One of the better Heng Hua food around. Been a customer for many years. Quality has been consistent so far. But it’s a small shop, and only has a few tables. So try to come earlier unless you don’t mind waiting."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjdiZXFBRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Service was fast and efficient. The Bee Hoon quite dry and too little vegetables - 3☆. The deep fried chicken Thai style not much flavor. Just the sweet sauce to enhance the taste 2☆. Fortunately the stir fried Mustard with dried shrimp and the deep fried Tenggui Fish are the winner 5☆. Mustard is simple and crunchy. Fish is fresh and crispy.
Ordered takeaway Lor mee and fried Sliced Yam which should be good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM2NiVklnEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,2,"Food - 3.8/5
Waiting time - 1/5
Service - 1/5

Food:
More affordable than putien restaurant. Taste decent, like any good standard zhi char stall, but wont say extraordinary. Menu was comprehensive.

Waiting time:
Dabaoed food for Sunday dinner. Placed order at 6.10pm, which i thought was pretty early. But only received the food at 7.10pm and after atleast 5 times of asking to check on my order.

Service:
Understandable that shop is crowded and everyone was busy. But when i keep asking the helpers to check on my order, they always ask the main guy directing the flow, and in the end no reply was given. Went directly to the main guy to ask to check, he didn't even look at the orders he had in hand and told me to come back 15min, and say its cooking already. Went back 10min later to check again, and asked if the dishes even started cooking. And he finally went to take a look and hurried his chefs on my order. Just felt he should be honest about the situation. If the dishes were not cooked, just be truthful. At least we can better estimate our own waiting time and not be a fool standing there and waiting. Also they seem to have another order line which people call in and ordered, and paid when they come to collect. Those orders and those eat in orders seemed to be prioritied compared us who took the effort to walk in and order, and even paid upfront. Really upset about this whole situation.

Those who intend to try the stall can perhaps catch them at the off peak hours, or try calling in to see if u can pre order. All the best."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta1BYUE13EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Journey to the North for affordable Putien Food. Aside from the must order Heng Hua Style Fried Bee Hoon & Heng Hua Style Lor Mee, highly recommended to try their Stir-Fried Sliced Yam. The Yam cubes are slightly crispy on the outside coated with some sweet sauce while it’s soft and mushy inside. I can just order this as a meal for myself, it’s so good!

Location: Heng Hua Restaurant, Yishun Street 72, #01-212 Block 748, Singapore 760748"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdDhDZmFREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Good food and fast service. Yam and bee hoon were amazing, definitely should order this two dishes when visiting."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1blBUdWRnEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Came down here for some HengHwa cuisine, ahhh… never disappoint! Gotta make reservation if you are coming down during dinner time. Will come back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcl8yS0lnEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Ordered the set for 2, just nice. Soup come w 6 fresh prawns which 3 of them are big, worth the $. Reasonable price n worth to try. Highly recommend."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eXRudHp3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"One restaurant is at the end of the block. It is worth waiting (not many seats). The Heng Hua rice noodle (Bee Hoon) is a must-try; although this is on the dry side, you have a different sensory while having it. Must try the blood cockles, which is now seldom available. The braised pork leg is the highlight of the meal; however, beware of the fats. The sweet and sour fish is also quite interesting, although deep-fried, it's so well done that you might want to go back to get more. Wear light clothing it's warm eating there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanJPWFBREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Nice food at reasonable price. We came around 11.45am. Total bill was $57.40 for 4 pax. 😁👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHXzZQQzhRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,1st visit here since we moved to this vicinity. Lor Mee tastes like Ban Mian with a lighter touch & okay soup base. Fried bee Hoon was dry and rather bland. Best is their See Hum blood cockles drenched in raw spicy garlic and sweetish sauce.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMGUyX2xnRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Herbs-Food Prawns in Bamboo Shoot, Deep Fried Slices of Tenggui Fish, Braised Bean Curd Skin with Kailan, Heng Hwa Mee Sua, Oyster Omelette. The restaurant putien has its origins in a coffee shop and has grown to become a Michelin worthy restaurant. If you still prefer the good old coffeeshop style, this Heng Hua cuisine which still operates under a HDB is an option and at an affordable one as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld3NMX2d3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,Tried their 4 pax menu and we were decently full! The lor mee is comparable to many other places I’ve tried and the fish was tasty. Never tried fried yam before but I think they made it quite well.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdjlHNGdRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Authentic food at economical price. Quite crowded at meals time.. better call to reserve in advance.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdTQ2RXJBRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Rare gem found in Singapore, foods serve here was nice, you can imagine the satisfication of 3 pax from the pictures post here~ 😝(don't doubt on us, it's really 3 pax only in total)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dlBudVdBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,NICEEEEE ❤️ Love the food here. Yummy. Will bring my family here to try.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMm9PRlNBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Pretty decent and value for money food. Having read mixed reviews I decided to trust the average rating. Yes it is a small place in a neighborhood. Adjust your expectations a little, it'll be an enjoyable experience. Not saying it's a lousy place, it's a neighborhood store, don't expect putien in a mall experience. I ordered take away and it was rather busy with dine in and take aways as well. Recommended and will return again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2FLaW53RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,Cheap and authentic Xin hua cuisine.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3NQMklBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,Authentic Xing Hua foods. Affordable price and big portion.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c0xxMEZ3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Good food. I tried steamed seabass $28 , dry fish hor fun $15, homemade tofu, garlic veg, tea n coke. All food was great. Spent about 65.

They accept credit card and have baby chairs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb3Etd1h3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Nice & reasonably priced. It's a small restaurant selling 'xing hua' dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxN3M3VXZBRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,2,"Went to this place at 520pm, was not crowded at all. However, despite the low crowd levels, the waitress was still very impatient in taking our order. She got irritated when we changed our order and ignore us when we tried to confirm the order one last time and just walked away. So upsetting as we visited the place with high expectations. Poor service! The food is not bad, a 6.5 upon 10."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MTR5SzRRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"This restaurant has been around for>10years, churning out tasty Heng Hua dishes. Always crowded during meal timing, so expect a 15 min wait and dishes will not be served all a once, so pace yourself.
Loves the HH Bee Hoon as it reminds me of my childhood where my neighbor is HH, auntie's HH home cook Bee Hoon was fantastic. Medium Size is able to feed family of 3 well.
The HH Lo Mee is tasty, my wife's favorite, nice stock. Nice noodle texture 🍜.
Reasonably priced dishes, good menu selections.
Still have room for improvement on the attitude of service staffs."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNl9DbkdREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,The bee hoon was quite special because it was so thin. I liked the candied yam too. But the rest were about average.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcjZUeW9RRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,2,"The lor mee is alright. Found much seafood and aromatics in the soup. Like dried shrimps, fried shallots and sliced red onion. However the ceiling needs mending. Found a cockroach leg on the table and I blew it away. Fortunately, it did not end up in my bowl of noodles :/"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMTYyZzJnRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"The restaurant is far from town , but food wise is good. So no complain on that . If you had tried Putien’s restaurant food. This is similar but way cheaper. Portion we ordered for two person in small size but three dishes were way enough for us both. Price include two steam rice and added an extra rice $31. Recommended for family and friends . But this place is hot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyckpUY0dBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,1,"Worst service which made us wait for almost 2hours for our packed food. They told us that it will be an hour wait. We abided and waited patiently. However, after an hour we asked the staff to check on our orders, they told us it’s cooking so we waited and waited. We probably have asked three different staff 4-5 times to please check on our orders. They all told us it’s cooking now. All the people who came after us have taken their food and left. We were really upset and told them  off. After that they checked and one staff said that the orders were missing. They told us they will cook now. It was such a frustrating experience, especially it’s Mother’s Day and all our old parents at home waited and hungry. One staff wearing an NUS shirt was rude, back faced and yelled in frustration. The service was so lousy. No one apologise at all.. all back faced us.. only one lady told us “cooking now cooking now”. It was such a disappointing experience. Service could have done better by giving us a better service recovery or at least sound apologetic. No apology at all. Shame on them. So next time people who go there please ask to see your receipt if not you will end up like us. Such a waste of time and food standard has dropped tremendously too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a05TeTBnRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Small eatery.
Food is good, rivals restaurant standard, but prices are low like coffeeshop zhi char.
Nice to find such quality food within a HDB estate"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOGVtckxREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Good and cheap everyday goto restaurant. Food is pretty good but not the best heng hua I have tried. No aircon and seatings are very tight.
Prices and pretty cheap, my dinner of 7 only spent less than $95 - we had some 8 dishes."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpX01YRkJ3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Location has sufficient car park slots available.
Have many sets to choose from. Overall good quality was good. The price was reasonable too.

The chilli is a must try!
Spice up the food and everything will taste better when the chilli was added to it.

Of course, do not expect too attentive service when they are busy.

Good place to go for your Bee Hoon craving..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMzZpX0xREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Heng Hwa Fried Bee Hoon was light and clean - though I can feel that some people may think of it as tasteless. But honestly speaking, their chilli is so shiok that even if you are on 'bee hoon too is tasteless' camp, just smother some of their chilli on and you will be converted instantly. Another dish that I would highly recommend is Stir Fried Sliced Yam - the combination of light crispy batter and a drizzle of sweet sauce was too darn addictive. The Sweet and Sour Pork was also solid, can feel the slab of lean meat on each piece (i.e. not 30% meat, 40% fat, 30% batter like some places). Also, they are generous on portion and is very wallet friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdU1fT0N3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Restaurant level food at neighborhood prices. Be prepared to wait, or share tables with other customers. Patronized 4 evenings ago.

The yam was a pleasant surprise. Plain looks, but fried with a little sweet taste. Great with beer. The chilli was the best accompaniment with the other food.

The lor mee is white in color. The taste reminded me of fish soup w milk. The fried mee sua is also packed with flavors.

All in all, a hearty meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDc19fdkxBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,2,Food is so so other than the famous Henghua mee Hoon. Price is at high side. We were asked to share table with others! Don’t think it is right when we r in phase 2 now
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaDh6b2FREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,Great and tasty food at affordable price. Able to make a booking on Sat night dinner and lots of choice for food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrclluWkh3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"No frills eatery with no aircon. Had fried mee sua, fried batang fish & garlic vegetable plus 2 drinks $27. Just nice for 2 persons"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bFpDdFdnEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,Love the heng hua style of food here. Especially the soft fried bee hoon. Food is serve fast.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJNG9pNUlREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"The is a small restaurant, hence sitting is limited. Be prepare to share table if it gets too crowded. The food is good and price is reasonable. The lor mee, fried sliced fish and oyster omelette are good. I find the fried bee Hoon too dry to my liking although the bee Hoon is fried until so fluffy. We enjoyed our meal."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjdWZ1Q2xRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Normally Singapore Zin char food flavor is quite good but very heavy，jia kut. However this restaurant is not. The flavor is mild and not strong. It’s perfectly seasoning. Seems no burden to your body. The knuckle is good and no porky. The fried bee hoon is so delicious and have so many textures, crunchy, fresh , nutty and savory. Must come and try. Total bill SGD14.5."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbXBLNXh3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Place offer nice spread of Heng Hua style foods. Not bad considering the price is very reasonable for zi char style. Worth a try and repeat visit
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjanV1WU1BEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Is my 1st time to buy from this restaurant after reading many reviews.  Is really worth to buy from this place cause food are so yummy. Waiting time is not long even there are many people ordered. I really like their fish hor fun, slice fishes are fresh n no fishy smell n hor fun really good 👍👍👍👍👍😋. I will go again! 🤩"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeE15RXF3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Only had Henghwa Lor Beehoon for lunch. At $4.50 a pop for small serving, you get enough carbo in signature fine strand beehoon. Ingredients fresh but not generous (inflation?) Suitable for those who dont like too starchy a gravy. Unlike other eateries, they dont dunk in fried pieces of yam. So i didnt have a chance to taste it. 😂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc0tINnJBRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Tried their signature dishes, and found their Heng hua style vermicelli and ""ru mian"" to be delicious. The sweet and sour pork was great as well, but the beancurd skin wig vegetable was average.

Compared with the Putien chain of restaurant, the prices here are way cheaper and of comparable taste - in fact I like their ru mian better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOW83TzVnRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Order their set meal for 2 and is great value for money. Come before 6.20pm if not their reataurant is usually packed with diner.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa1B1dU5BEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Rather disappointing experience that did not live up to the reviews and Google rating. Ordered four dishes:
-  Mongolian pork ribs : too dry
-beancurd with prawns : decent but nothing to rave about
-Heng Hua been Hoon: rather dry as well and not as nice as Pu Tien standard
-oyster omelette: fluffy and spongy but flavour is lacking.

Overall decent meal at affordable price but certainly not anything special."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwLXN6TURBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Food above average but has given four stars as I find the pricing reasonable.

Worth a visit for all Heng Hua food lovers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eTdmQk9REAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Ordered fried fish, bee hoon and lor mee.. nice.
Chrysanthemum tea niice too!!
Downside is just a bit too hot.
Food still good like before. No need to go Putien"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NzZpbmd3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Try the Xing Hua Beehoon and Lor mee! Definitely nicer than the other dishes. We ordered both medium size, $8. The lor mee is substantially a lot more and can probably be shared between 3 people while the beehoon can be shared between 2. The other dishes e.g. deep fried crispy prawn fritters $8 has no hint of prawns, just taste like regular Ngoh Hiang, and the stir fried white clams $10 with spicy sauce was very salty. There isn’t any queue when I went there on a weekday dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFLXBYVktBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Be prepared to wait for at least an hour to get a seat as it is very popular n the restaurant is quite small.  But it is worth the wait as the dishes r unique n delicious.  We ordered fried sweet yam n steam mee sua which r 😋 There r many more dishes that must try eg herbal prawn in bamboo stick, lychee pork, etc..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d2VpWXBRRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,2,"Food is ok. The black sauce noodles was nothing but salty.. salted egg pork ribs was covered in batter w almost no meat at all. Claypot rice is the only decent thing here, guess that’s why that’s their store name. Give this a miss because in this area there is bound to have better food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b2JUWG93RRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Not very crowded when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.

Ice milo is $3.60 a cup! I thought that was a bit too expensive for a coffee shop setting.

Food is generally nice. The garlic chicken was not to my liking as they cooked with curry powder. Stir fry la la is very nice. The sauce is good. Claypot rice is generous with the salted fish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydV82Ym9BRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"We had a small traditional claypot rice, a small claypot seafood fried beehoon, a small homemade crispy bean curd (10 pcs) and 4 Chinese tea to share among 4 pax. Total bill $38.60.

The food was yummy and everything was served hot and freshly cooked 👍🏻 they gave us 4 bowls without having to ask for it and service was prompt.

Indoor seating was quite cooling and we actually felt like we were in malaysia due to the setting.

Only qualm was that we were all very thirsty abt half an hour after the meal which likely meant that there was quite a bit of msg in it. Otherwise, definitely worth a try and we will definitely go back and try their other dishes!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyd0tuYi1RRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"Have been coming here regularly for my claypot rice cravings. Although portion seems to have become smaller, but the quality is still good and the medium sized is good for two"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybmNhcTFnRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,2,Was here on 22-May-2022 dinner and order 5 dishes. The famous claypot chickens rice was smooth and good. Other 3 dishes was alright. But the worst is the cereal prawn which cereal taste was ok but the prawn seem to either have 2 different species 1 of them look fresh healthy and the rest of the prawn was in dark black along edge of shell all over. Call for advise they said the rest in black is over oil flies and only 1 is just flies right. That’s the explain and place back the same dish on the table. Omg. Is that a good explanation and acceptable for dinner? That’s is totally and chef skill issue and was treated in these manner. Very disappointed indeed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOEplR0l3EAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"Second time here. Service is always slow and bad despite an empty restaurant. 45 min of waiting.

All the staffs just stay group around chatting without following up on your orders.

Food is tasty.

Pls get them to work on service level."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWM2YVpBEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,2,"Came here as I have been craving good claypot rice and read a review. Was quite disappointed though as the claypot rice was quite soggy and had no oomph to it. It was actually pretty tasteless. The meal was saved by the San Lao mee hoon and garlic chicken both of which were far better. That's a pity as the name of the shop is Sembawang Claypot Rice.

Ambience-wise, it's a non-AC coffeeshop space. There's no service charge or GST so don't expect service with a smile. Payment by cash only - no cards or Nets"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaWZYV19nRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,Super fragrant claypot rice with a generous portion of meat. The San Lou Bee Hoon was crisp on the outside yet still moist and flavourful in its entirety. My friend is vegetarian so we asked them if they could do a vegetarian version of the Bee Hoon and turns out they were more than willing to accommodate our request. Top 2 must try dishes!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOUwyX1l3EAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"We were a party of 3 and ordered 6 items with the intention to sample as much as we can. The pricing was very reasonable and perhaps the food was just about as well. Starting with the least - KL fried hokkien mee was very disappointing (texture of noodle was so limp), also not impressed with the claypot rice which lacked flavor (it needed quite a bit of dark soy sauce to salvage), garlic chicken was OK (its nice having fresh chicken with all the chopped up/ odd bits). But we certainly enjoyed the 三楼米粉, 咸蛋排骨 and the spinach in 3 eggs. Will try new dishes (maybe curry fish head) if we do return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdWI2OFZnEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"The ambience is nice n clean , the staff there are very helpful. And the main agenda claypot chicken rice is good too. And also to add their burnt bee hoon was very nice too. Its sure worth the money to give urself a treat here..value for money.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPakxULXhBRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"The crispy rice bits and chilli are always highlights of the claypot rice. Garlic fried chicken & hakka fried pork are some of my go to dishes whenever I'm here. First time trying the Thai style Yong tau foo and greatly enjoyed the Thai chilli sauce that came with it - refreshing pineapple notes! Bittergourd egg and San lou mifen were also lovely.

Great for small or big groups - you can always call in advance to pre-order."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOV9YSE1BEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"😕😟🙁 Was there two night ago. Overall experience,  ambient not there , serving so so, pay first before you eat. The dishes that I have order , Only the San Lou Mee Hoon and garlic chicken taste Okay . The Sambal Sotong not fresh and super hard to chew. The rest not worth mentioned. For me the Bao Fa Tradition Food  claypot rice at Bukit Batok is so much tasty then here. 🥴🙄😕"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzVuMHlBRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"The claypot rice is very nice! Small portion just for 1 pax, we ordered the medium portion for 2 pax which is $15.80. San Lou beehoon三楼米粉 is nice too, while the crispy tofu自制脆皮豆腐 is tasteless, it taste like the fried frozen seafood tofu.

Given a restaurant without aircon, the price is on high side, total bill $52 for 2 adults and 2 kids."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeklDa3V3RRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"Why no claypot rice? I asked after 20 minutes of waiting, twice in between 10 minutes interval, total 40 minutes, after finishing my 2 dishes ( as picture), the claypot rice haven't serve to us. After 40 minutes wait, one uncle ordered same time as us, he already finished his rice and left, while we still waiting our claypot rice, after asking twice on the order.

Bad service. Super bad service. There was no queue at all with many of seats available. I was here and orderded at 5.07pm. My claypot rice served to us at 5.50pm. And best part of the bad service? The rice was NOT fully cooked when FINALLY served to us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2M3ZhUjZRRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"A no frills tze char stall with decent food quality, seated quickly on a sunday afternoon.. especially loved the san lou bee hoon which looked deceptively nondescript but was super tasty. Also really loved the garlic chicken although the signature claypot chicken rice was a little mushy and lackluster. Hakka Crispy pork was a passable dish albeit a bit too fatty for my liking."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb1BHa1hREAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Dine in always the best choice if u wanna eat claypot. But due to the limited seat we choose to tapao.

They provide online delivery but have to meet a min $30 (will charge delivery fees)
Free delivery within 3km from the store.

Recommend their claypot & sanlou beehoon. This two eat with their chilly will be perfect."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNWQydlBBEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"Besides serving up one of the best claypot rice in Singapore, this location also has a large spread of other dishes that are of great quality! Calling in to make an EARLY BOOKING for your claypot is highly recommended to secure yourself a seat and reduce waiting time for food. Though I dare say that it is still worth the queue if you have to do so!

The chili sauces here are crazy spicy but go extremely well with the food.

Finding a lot for your vehicle will be the biggest challenge here. Good thing there is an underground carpark just opposite the restaurant.

Location is not so wheelchair friendly and will require some lifting. They might/should be able to assign tables closer to the entrance if a prior reservation call is made."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMlA2ZEpnEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Have no issue in communicating with the staffs in Chinese. The food are Averagely good. The clay pot chicken have many tiny bones , not sure if it’s due to frozen chicken or overcook. The garlic chicken is garlic-ky.. can see many garlics in there haha. Meanwhile, have to wait awhile for food to be ready, not sure why but still within acceptable range."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyamZiVm5nRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"This place is worth a visit if you like claypot rice with rice crisps and salted fish. Paired with chilli padi or the chilli sauce provided, it was heavenly. Totally enjoyed the claypot rice. But the other dishes we ordered were nothing to rave about. They were good but not great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M0phR1dBEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"The Claypot Chicken rice is as good as per expected. Mee Hoon is the best amongst. However, the KL black noodles is too salty."

The Da Lou Mee is terrible (2.0 out of 5), but generous amount of pork lard was given. Will come back for the San Lou Bee Hoon and maybe try out their Claypot Rice next time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ZzZ1Um9nRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"This restaurant is famously known for their claypot rice, but imo, the beehoon taste better.

Thai style yong tou foo is overly oily due to their ingredients are deepfried. Salted egg bitterground is very tasty and doesnt taste like bitterground at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHZ1lhMFR3EAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Great wokhey in the beehoon, and the crunchy rice so good. 🤩. Would give 5 star except one of our bowls dirty and needed to be replaced. 5 star food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbFBTUzlRRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,2,"Heard some blogger recommended this claypot rice.
Personally nothing special about the food. Order a medium size claypot rice. Ingredients quite generous but taste too plain. Nothing special or distinctive that make me wow at all. Not salty not sweet. Not fragrance. Rice too soft and broken once we mixed it.
Ordered a side dish Hakka Crispy pork. Indeed crispy and tender meat but tasteless… not salty nor sweet. Can’t taste any special at all with the “red” crispy flour coating.
Consider “heathy” Low salt Low sugar?”"

Claypot rice was piping hot and flavourful.
Homemade cripsy beancurd really cripsy on skin and very tasty!
Chilli and dark sauce given on the side in bottles.
Recommended! 👍"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdW8yQ2xRRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"This place features a clay pot chicken rice dish which cooks over traditional fire. As each dish is cook to order, the waiting time ranges about 20-30 minutes. The rice will leave a layer of crispy burn rice at the bottom of the clay pot, this gives a special fragrance loved by asian family. The chicken is tender and fresh, adds a protein to the food. There is also some mixture of Chinese sausage and salted fish. Add on some dark soy sauce to boost the dish to a next level."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMVp5Yk5nEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Skipping the queue with early dinner. Reach here at about 4.30pm and order the claypot rice, San Lou Fried Bee Hoon and salted egg butter gourd. The taste is good overall but not the claypot rice, perhaps more salted fish needs to be added to make it more flavourful."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeXZUekh3EAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Traditional Claypot Rice, Sambal Sotong, Qing Long Cai 清龙菜. While they do have a traditional style claypot rice, I didn't feel like this place is worth making a trip down for when I have better options at Holland Drive.  The sambal sotong was not what I expected and was a meh."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDMnNxUnV3RRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Ordered the medium serving claypot rice, added a lot of soy sauce myself and made sure to mixed like siao. The claypot rice was slightly bitter giving a lot of charred flavour to the dish. It tasted quite good! Chinese sausage egg omelette was delicious, bitter gourd soup was simple and nice. There were no customers when I ate there today hence my orders came within 10 minutes plus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X052MXpnRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,We ordered the Set D and thought it was a good deal initially but realised the fish head wasn’t even half a head. The vegetables was a little stringy and the fried udon totally inedible. Claypot rice so-so. Granted it was a delivery and so expected food to be served a bit cold but I doubt I will ever be eating there in person.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaU55Qlh3EAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Order can be taken while still in queue to minimize the wait time once a table becomes available. 三捞米粉 was good, not many place does this style of cooking. 芙蓉蛋 was below average with parts of the egg was uncooked/watery. Garlic chicken was tasty but too much non edible skin of the garlic and not much meat. Clay pot rice itself was nothing to shout about."

Expect to wait 20min. The claypot rice is quite ordinary. Ive tasted better elsewhere but could be due to the fact that claypot rice not good for takeaway.  Across a road is a tiny mall, do shopping there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb01MTXZBRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"Go elsewhere for better food!! Better close ur restaurant than to hire such staffs!
Had their food twice! Food mediocre. Super Attitude- Service terrible . All waitresses busy looking at their handphones. Not interested to serve you and will argue , raise voice at you. We were the only customers in the restaurant at 5:15pm. Takeaway chicken curry taste terrible. Not worth paying the price to dine in or takeaway.  The place doesn’t have aircon. Super humid even with fan. Need to pay extra $0.50 for takeaway box. I give 1star for your chilli sauce!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdWVHRlZBEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"The ingredients of the medium pack is the SAME as the small pack, the difference is mainly the amount of RICE!

Ordered takeaway at 6:25 pm and was told to collect the food 45 mins later. When I got back, the food wasn’t ready yet. Gave them the benefit of doubt, came back to check another 25 mins later, where’s my food?! Oh, after the second time they finally ‘checked’ the order and my takeaway was ready in 3 mins.

Not worth the wait or queue in my opinion, in terms of service, food portion and quality. Perhaps the north side just lacks a really good authentic claypot rice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MFl2czJnRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,5,"Not sure why the rating is so low. The claypot chicken rice is really decent, with the rice just nice (not too burnt, but crispy), adequate amount of salted fish, and the chicken was well marinated, albeit a lot of bones.

Quantity is also generous, like typical claypot rice places. The medium can feed 3 girls.

Chilli was not bad too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXVqYTN3RRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"Waited more than 1 hour, ordered claypot rice with side dishes. No sign of side dishes and claypot rice.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcDZ5RF9RRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"I feel is a bit overrated on their claypot rice. But their san lao bee hoon is the high lite instead. The queue is seriously long. There is at best 15 tables indoor and 8 outdoor. The outdoor table is by a big drain, remind me of going to malaysia eating outdoor. Qing long veg feels normal. The garlic chicken also feel soso."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MGI2aGVnEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Pardon me. I usually take photos of food after I have tasted them. We only ordered the claypot rice and a coffee.
Claypot is average as I had tasted better than this in Bukit Batok East Ave 3. As for this one, rice and salted fish pass my standard. Will not specifically drive down for this but can drop by when I’m near to this area. Potion is slightly lesser but I like the potion of vegetables provided. Oh yes, chicken texture and cut taste and look funny. Maybe is due to frozen chicken."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4aVphQjhnRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"We ordered the Claypot Rice, curry fish head, dai luk Noodle, San lou Noodle, and salted egg bitter gourd. The Claypot Rice was really nothing impressive. There have been other Claypot Rice which are much better than this place. Especially for the price tag, totally not worth it.

However, the other dishes were very good. San lou Noodle and dai luk Noodle was good. Curry fish head was also spicy and also filling.

That being said, the very off putting thing about this place is that after you order, before you eat, you have to pay up. I did not mind the first time before starting to eat, but during our meals, when we ordered additional drinks, it was really off putting and a hassle.

Will recommend this place if your coming here for the zhi char, but definitely not for the Claypot Rice."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNLWRUaWxnRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Claypot rice was really superb, you can adjust the taste as you please by controlling the amount of soy sauce to add.
The fish head curry was very thick and flavourful, but they give you half a head of fish so we felt that it was on the pricy side.
Overall not too bad."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNbzctY19nRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,3,"Dined there at a quarter past 9 on a week day. Managed to find parking after circling the neighborhood twice.

Restaurant was quiet; only four tables occupied. Was told that our claypot rice would take around 25 minutes to prepare. Lucky for us, it arrived earlier.

Ordered medium size claypot rice. To be honest, at $13.80, it does feel a bit pricey. Fortunately, it tastes okay.

Ordered a small plate of their San Lou Bee Hoon. It was a first for me and my father liked it. Yes. It's dry. But that's how it should be.

Customer service is what you'd normally get from a well-mannered Foreign talent from the middle Kingdom.

In conclusion, tastes okay. But if you factor in the price, I reckon it's a wee bit pricey. Parking and seating will most definitely be an issue during peak periods. Will come back again just to let my mother try the food here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpLWRiTThBRRAB,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,4,"Be prepared for one hr wait caz the Claypot rice was cooked from scratch! Tried the salted egg bitter, hakka fried pork, and of course Claypot rice. They were amazing"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcFoyWkpnEAE,Sembawang Traditional Claypot Rice,1,"Had a KL da lu mian 大陆面 which looked very authentic when served. After i tasted it.. it was simply horrifying. I thought there was what tasted like dried shrimps inside this dark sauce noodles dish, then the staff clarified that having tons of dried solefish is part of its recipe. 🙈

I have eaten many KL 大陆面before and non of them ever had dried solefish which taste like dried shrimps in it before. Can you imagine like having dried shrimps/solefish taste inside your dark carrot cake, dark braised trotter.

After this episode, In the future when i order this dish elsewhere, i will have to ask if they have dried solefish or shrimps inside their 大陆面 before i place an order. These are ingredients terrorist messing up a wonderful recipe."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cklmdFh3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Located some distance away from the mrt. The omelette, fried rice and red wine chicken are good.

Price wise seems quite standard."

Sweet and Sour Pork is crispy and tasted great.
Steamed Sea Bass is Fresh and meat is tender.
Fried Toufu is so so soft and delicious.
The Xing Hua Bee Hoon and Lor Mee have that nostalgic taste.

Just the sweet sauce to enhance the taste 2☆. Fortunately the stir fried Mustard with dried shrimp and the deep fried Tenggui Fish are the winner 5☆. Mustard is simple and crunchy. Fish is fresh and crispy.
Ordered takeaway Lor mee and fried Sliced Yam which should be good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM2NiVklnEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,2,"Food - 3.8/5
Waiting time - 1/5
Service - 1/5

Food:
More affordable than putien restaurant. Taste decent, like any good standard zhi char stall, but wont say extraordinary. Menu was comprehensive.

Waiting time:
Dabaoed food for Sunday dinner. Placed order at 6.10pm, which i thought was pretty early. But only received the food at 7.10pm and after atleast 5 times of asking to check on my order.

Service:
Understandable that shop is crowded and everyone was busy. But when i keep asking the helpers to check on my order, they always ask the main guy directing the flow, and in the end no reply was given. Went directly to the main guy to ask to check, he didn't even look at the orders he had in hand and told me to come back 15min, and say its cooking already. Went back 10min later to check again, and asked if the dishes even started cooking. And he finally went to take a look and hurried his chefs on my order. Just felt he should be honest about the situation. If the dishes were not cooked, just be truthful. At least we can better estimate our own waiting time and not be a fool standing there and waiting. Also they seem to have another order line which people call in and ordered, and paid when they come to collect. Those orders and those eat in orders seemed to be prioritied compared us who took the effort to walk in and order, and even paid upfront. Really upset about this whole situation.

Those who intend to try the stall can perhaps catch them at the off peak hours, or try calling in to see if u can pre order. All the best."

Aside from the must order Heng Hua Style Fried Bee Hoon & Heng Hua Style Lor Mee, highly recommended to try their Stir-Fried Sliced Yam.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eXRudHp3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"One restaurant is at the end of the block. It is worth waiting (not many seats). The Heng Hua rice noodle (Bee Hoon) is a must-try; although this is on the dry side, you have a different sensory while having it. Must try the blood cockles, which is now seldom available. The braised pork leg is the highlight of the meal; however, beware of the fats. The sweet and sour fish is also quite interesting, although deep-fried, it's so well done that you might want to go back to get more. Wear light clothing it's warm eating there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXanJPWFBREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Nice food at reasonable price. We came around 11.45am. Total bill was $57.40 for 4 pax. 😁👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHXzZQQzhRRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,1st visit here since we moved to this vicinity. Lor Mee tastes like Ban Mian with a lighter touch & okay soup base.

However, despite the low crowd levels, the waitress was still very impatient in taking our order. She got irritated when we changed our order and ignore us when we tried to confirm the order one last time and just walked away. So upsetting as we visited the place with high expectations.

Loves the HH Bee Hoon as it reminds me of my childhood where my neighbor is HH, auntie's HH home cook Bee Hoon was fantastic. Medium Size is able to feed family of 3 well.
The HH Lo Mee is tasty, my wife's favorite, nice stock. Nice noodle texture 🍜.
Reasonably priced dishes, good menu selections.
Still have room for improvement on the attitude of service staffs."

Recommended for family and friends . But this place is hot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyckpUY0dBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,1,"Worst service which made us wait for almost 2hours for our packed food. They told us that it will be an hour wait. We abided and waited patiently. However, after an hour we asked the staff to check on our orders, they told us it’s cooking so we waited and waited. We probably have asked three different staff 4-5 times to please check on our orders. They all told us it’s cooking now. All the people who came after us have taken their food and left. We were really upset and told them  off. After that they checked and one staff said that the orders were missing. They told us they will cook now. It was such a frustrating experience, especially it’s Mother’s Day and all our old parents at home waited and hungry. One staff wearing an NUS shirt was rude, back faced and yelled in frustration. The service was so lousy. No one apologise at all.. all back faced us.. only one lady told us “cooking now cooking now”. It was such a disappointing experience. Service could have done better by giving us a better service recovery or at least sound apologetic. No apology at all. Shame on them. So next time people who go there please ask to see your receipt if not you will end up like us. Such a waste of time and food standard has dropped tremendously too."

Good place to go for your Bee Hoon craving..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMzZpX0xREAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Heng Hwa Fried Bee Hoon was light and clean - though I can feel that some people may think of it as tasteless. But honestly speaking, their chilli is so shiok that even if you are on 'bee hoon too is tasteless' camp, just smother some of their chilli on and you will be converted instantly. Another dish that I would highly recommend is Stir Fried Sliced Yam - the combination of light crispy batter and a drizzle of sweet sauce was too darn addictive. The Sweet and Sour Pork was also solid, can feel the slab of lean meat on each piece (i.e. not 30% meat, 40% fat, 30% batter like some places). Also, they are generous on portion and is very wallet friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdU1fT0N3EAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Restaurant level food at neighborhood prices. Be prepared to wait, or share tables with other customers. Patronized 4 evenings ago.

The yam was a pleasant surprise. Plain looks, but fried with a little sweet taste. Great with beer. The chilli was the best accompaniment with the other food.

The lor mee is white in color. The taste reminded me of fish soup w milk. The fried mee sua is also packed with flavors.

All in all, a hearty meal."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeE15RXF3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Only had Henghwa Lor Beehoon for lunch. At $4.50 a pop for small serving, you get enough carbo in signature fine strand beehoon. Ingredients fresh but not generous (inflation?) Suitable for those who dont like too starchy a gravy. Unlike other eateries, they dont dunk in fried pieces of yam. So i didnt have a chance to taste it. 😂"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc0tINnJBRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Tried their signature dishes, and found their Heng hua style vermicelli and ""ru mian"" to be delicious. The sweet and sour pork was great as well, but the beancurd skin wig vegetable was average.

Compared with the Putien chain of restaurant, the prices here are way cheaper and of comparable taste - in fact I like their ru mian better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOW83TzVnRRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,Order their set meal for 2 and is great value for money. Come before 6.20pm if not their reataurant is usually packed with diner.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa1B1dU5BEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Rather disappointing experience that did not live up to the reviews and Google rating. Ordered four dishes:
-  Mongolian pork ribs : too dry
-beancurd with prawns : decent but nothing to rave about
-Heng Hua been Hoon: rather dry as well and not as nice as Pu Tien standard
-oyster omelette: fluffy and spongy but flavour is lacking.

Overall decent meal at affordable price but certainly not anything special."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwLXN6TURBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Food above average but has given four stars as I find the pricing reasonable.

Worth a visit for all Heng Hua food lovers."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eTdmQk9REAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,5,"Ordered fried fish, bee hoon and lor mee.. nice.
Chrysanthemum tea niice too!!
Downside is just a bit too hot.
Food still good like before. No need to go Putien"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NzZpbmd3RRAB,Heng Hua Restaurant,3,"Try the Xing Hua Beehoon and Lor mee! Definitely nicer than the other dishes. We ordered both medium size, $8. The lor mee is substantially a lot more and can probably be shared between 3 people while the beehoon can be shared between 2. The other dishes e.g. deep fried crispy prawn fritters $8 has no hint of prawns, just taste like regular Ngoh Hiang, and the stir fried white clams $10 with spicy sauce was very salty. There isn’t any queue when I went there on a weekday dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFLXBYVktBEAE,Heng Hua Restaurant,4,"Be prepared to wait for at least an hour to get a seat as it is very popular n the restaurant is quite small.  But it is worth the wait as the dishes r unique n delicious.  We ordered fried sweet yam n steam mee sua which r 😋 There r many more dishes that must try eg herbal prawn in bamboo stick, lychee pork, etc..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaWVHMlV3EAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,Love the duck here. Food is good. The service is very good!! The staff is attentive and polite. They checked to see if we have food allergies & explained some of the dishes to us. I dropped a pair of chopsticks and they replaced it before I could even call for help.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b05EV0hREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,"One of our regular restaurant that me & parents patronize regularly. These 2 dishes  are our favorite, and the taste has been consistent.

We are always happy to be served by one of their waitress, Ah Fun. She is courteous and helpful when taking our orders. Good service! Keep it up."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MjhhYzVRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"We ordered a three-pax signature dishes set meal, a six-course meal (excluding rice), it was just nice for my family of four (we are not really big eaters). We signed up for their membership ($88) - you will get $50 x 2 vouchers and a whole duck, which is quite worth it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OW9MZXNRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Absolutely no disappointment I can assure you as we been their regular all this while and each visit hasn't been a let-down with this vendor over the years.

🦆Their signature Angelica Herbal Roasted Duck is a must to order for the meat eaters, it was simply savoury, meats were tender and juicy, flavourful  and simply gratifying it's worthwhile your calories believe me lol😅😅😉🙃.

🌱The lettuce with oyster sauce were fresh and cruchcy stirred fried with fragranced wok hey (the charred after taste of the wok under high flames).

Sizzling hotplate beancurd with minced meat and Pickled Vegetables was delectable 😋.

It actually came with 2 rice but we ordered xtra YiFu Mee and it blended perfectly well with the roasted duck.

Home make Barley water was my favourite drink it's not too sweet and good to the taste.

I was at their branch at City Square Mall a month ago, i shall say that they were very consistent with their taste gastronomically, you don't see sub-standard throughout their outlets with my experienced. Kudos to the teams.

Damage was around💳 $62,  worthy for 2 pax.

Waitpersons were friendly and service was prompt, attentive and welcoming 😁😁😁good job!

It's lunch time and there's enough spaces between tables it can easily accommodate big group and its not rowdy and noisy here it's comfortable and relaxing.

Ambience was also hygienic, spacious and neat

Highly recommended if you are around.Try it NOW😁

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNnVMZXp3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Love the taste of the food. Taste healthy and delicious. I would definitely return to try the other food on the menu.
Hopefully they don’t increase the price further.
I would not recommend getting the membership if you do not come often as it is not very worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaExyR1Z3EAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,We had 25% off during lunch. Order before 12:30pm on weekday. Service crew was efficient and good in recommending. 👍🏻after discount our bill was about $100.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcTZubHJBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Very nice variety of food selection, from vegetarian, egg, chicken, fish, goat, duck. Definitely good for dinning in group."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb2ZLNWNBEAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,"My first time eating here. Really enjoyed the duck with Angelica Herb. The sweet and sour pork was quite normal, but the assorted vegetables with seafood came with a generous portion of prawns. Overall I enjoyed my meal. It was made better by using the Chope voucher, paid $35 for $50 of value. Also got a $10 voucher (min $80 spend) for paying with my Citibank credit card."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNUxMczRBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Visited again and decided to post another new review with new menu they introduced. Early bird before 12.30pm on weekdays get 25% off. It was a long overdue CNY team lunch and we enjoy the foods and had great chat.

We order a la carte dishes from the menu, didn't manage to take all the food photos. However, here is the listing on top of what had posted, Fish maw soup with seafood and wheatgrass tofu with seafood.

The foods always amaze me with the ingredients used and enriched taste in all of them. The environment is cozy since we got the table near the window and we order the Bailey drinks that were really rich, must try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2X1BLT3pnRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,3,Food taste is good but portion and price have seem to reduce and increase respectively. We ordered via FoodPanda a half of the Duck Roasted with Angelica Herb at $34 which honestly isn’t enough for 2-3 adults compared to 2 - 3 years back when we had them in the restaurants.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDM3FPUy1RRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,4,"The service is quite excellent. I like that they do not squish the patrons which I like (you don't feel that others watching you eat). The duck has maintained the standard. The boiled soup is rather too salty. The rest of the food is quite average, the portions varies from dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMGNDV3VBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Great hygiene, always good roast duck, never disappoint.
Slightly understaffed but every crew member was doing their best.
First charge to debone the duck.
Charge for extra herbal sauce on the duck, which could be complementary on request.
Great handmade jade tofu!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aHAtRXhnRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,Still loved their roasted duck w angelica herb.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3RYLUxREAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,"Crowded eating place in Northpoint City. Good to join their membership pavkage to get good offer, such as one duck roasted and 2 x $50 e-voucher but restricted in using the package."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpLU9YWHpRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,4,30% off ala carte is worth it during weekdays off peak hours. As usual their signature herbal duck satisfies to no end. Match made in heaven with their moist & fluffy white rice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNE9PZ0VREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,The roast duck was AWESOME! That's probably the most important information you need to know
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMUwtX2tRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,4,Love the duck.. Worth the money. Service is good but price a bit high.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyN28ySnFBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank your staff (90787 Lee Yoke Chan) of the Northpoint branch.

We knew the crowd on a Sunday (15th May 2022) and we expect queuing for a while for a table of 10 pax for our 1st family dinner in 2 years.  After staying in the queue for 30 mins, Mdm Lee received us at front of the queue. She informed us that we will need to wait for around 1 hour plus as the restaurant had only 2 rooms with table that could accommodate 10 pax. She was very polite and even apologised for the long waiting time, as there was another family of 10 infront of us waiting for a table.

At around 7.30PM, Mdm Lee asked us if we would like to have a split table 5 + 5 as she wasn’t sure how long more we will need to wait for the next room. She was kind enough to offer us this arrangement as we were already waiting for 1.5 hour. We agreed to the arrangement, and while we were preparing to order, we noticed that the customer that was in the room had completed their meal and is leaving the room. Hence we asked Mdm Lee if we could change our table to the room. She kindly agrees to our request. We were told to wait outside the restaurant while she worked to clear the room for us.

While waiting outside, we heard that the other customer behind us (also with 10+ pax) shouted at Mdm Lee. They were unhappy that the room was given to us as we had already accepted the split table. They accused Mdm Lee of being unfair and they continue to hurl accusations, insults in Mdm Lee to the verge of tears. I am writing this feedback to clarify these points;

(1) Mdm Lee is acting professionally, and even so after continuous accusations and insults from customer

(2) Mdm Lee tries hard to accommodate request and provide solution to us and the other customer

(3) Mdm Lee do not deserve the insults and accusations made against her

(4) We were given the room because we were next in the queue and made the request to Mdm Lee

(5) We heard the other customer will be complaining against Mdm Lee, we would like to provide our side of the story

(6) We would like to thank Mdm Lee for her professionalism and apologise to her for the inconveniences caused to her"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnN2YTd3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,2,"The tables are stained, not cleaned properly. The glass thingy in the middle in scratched, the room has mould building up around the place. The room inside looks like it hasn't been clean for 5 days or so. The staff is a mess. And the chill we order from the start of the meal didn't even come."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNFktNzV3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,1,Cannot request to sit somewhere else even though having many empty table around. (Still not ordering)The waitress very rude and strictly cannot sit on other table. Very bad service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPX2MyNXVRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Really love the staff services from this outlet.
Excellent services 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 appreciate

Will definitely do another review for the food :)

Will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaHN1LTZRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,Eating here on a weekday lunch is really peaceful. Enjoyed their set lunch alot.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN2NtRWd3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,1,"went to have dinner on 29 march, was told to sit 1 side of the sofa as usual, food came, and i went over to the other side to take a pic for my sponse and was being told off rudely by the cashier staff i am not allow to even go over to take picture that i will be ""fine"" for doing so..

come on, its 29 march.. when new Covid safety measure has lighten, i was over for less than 5sec to jus take a picture.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MDY3LTd3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,2,Friendly staff Nice services.  But product was abit under my expectations. Not going back again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMWVUWkF3EAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Amazing service, the staff were really disciplined and responsive to our needs. Food was especially delicious, I would recommend the Mongolian spare ribs, the heavily peppered but not so overpowering taste of the sauce and crunch of the pork was absolutely delectable. I had an enjoyable late lunch with my family!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ck9feUxnEAE,Dian Xiao Er,3,"Taste of the food is so-so.. Quite average.. Food served was not hot indicating that the food may be left at the kitchen for awhile be serving.

To be honest I would say that going to the zhi char stall is better.

Dang Gui duck was a tad on the sweeter side.

Overall food is normal price is high. Won't return."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bk1LZzdRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,The staffs were friendly and attentive. Definitely a good experience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaVBMblFREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Had been dining quite frequently at Dian Xiao Er branches, and the standard has been consistent. Besides their tasty signature roast duck, their pan fried cod and petai prawns are good too. 😋 The dishes can be somewhat filling, so you have to know the portions they are serving before you get a good idea how much to order. Would recommend this place if you want to eat Chinese cuisine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLektERmVREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Had a family dinner for 5 adults and 1 toddler on Saturday, 1 May, at 5 p.m. We were allowed in only when everyone arrives.

Dishes ordered included their famous Dang Kui Duck, lotus and pumpkin with salted egg sauce, pork ribs without bone, cha siu, and soup of the day. Every dish tasted great. Even the white rice was steamed to keep it tasting great while many restaurants are merely serving rice from a big rice cooker.

The only think that needs improvement is their Chinese tea, we ordered the pu er, individual serving.  Doesn't taste like high quality tea.

We loved the food so much that we signed up for the $88 membership to get $50x2 vouchers and 4 small dishes of their roast duck. A one time 20% off for birthday month voucher is also given. We will definitely go back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5eXJLcHJRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,3,"The food is good but the service from a supervisor sux real bad. Very rude and loud. Take note most seats do not have back rest, chair not suitable for elderly. We changed the seats to those with back rear as we have 4 elderly diner and was scolded by the young supervisor and an elderly China waitress. Suggest to avoid Yishun Dian Xiao Er and go another branch instead or try Putien further down the corner which is a grade higher.
Not suitable to hold business meal here due to the low service standard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaE9DX3Z3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,Enjoyed our meal with great-tasting dishes especially the duck. Prices are very reasonable and very good services and warm welcome by waitress. We would visit again for sure 👍👍👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta2J6QTR3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,1,Suggest to avoid Northpoint branch if you have more than 5 pax but sitting separately. They won’t accept even though the group is going to be split into less than 5 with the same household and sit apart.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtXzQ3c2l3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,3,Waited for quite after I was sitted before someone attended to me for my order and the seats are not comfortable...a bit stuffy and warm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcW9DR3R3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Service was excellent!

Dishes tried:
XO fried rice - very good!
XO French bean - delicious!
Marmite chicken - fried chicken with marmite sauce, not bad.
Claypot eggplant - oily, generous with minced meat. Eggplant was soft. Not so good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjZ0pQa1h3EAE,Dian Xiao Er,1,"Bad attitude from staff, was waiting for takeaway orders. Kept having to ask if our order is ready, staffs said no but later on we found out it was ready long ago.

When took back home, found out that one of the rice packet was not air tight secured. Circuit breaker is a dangerous time, would you dare to eat dishes which are not well contained and exposed to the air surroundings of a covid infested mall?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpajZlRjZ3RRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"One of the best meals i ever had. Every single dish was delicious. Prompt and efficient service. Will definitely return, thank you ! ;)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1amZXQThRRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,Best roast duck at northpoint branch
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybk1mdXRBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,"Go to place for the duck. Price is not cheap, but for the quality and service, it is not too bad!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOTlEU19RRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,4,Soft and tasty herbal duck. the mongolian ribs are nice oo.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OXZHMkxnEAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,"It's not bad. The food is good, service good. The tables are rather small though. 7 people eaten at a table of 4 is rather squeeze...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpc3F6amNREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,My favorite roast duck place. Loved the dong bo rou too... Service has always been pretty good and food is served on time .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxekw2ZmZREAE,Dian Xiao Er,3,Been told by the staff waiting time half an hour but ended up become one hour waiting time. It is better to order first at home then come and collect. Don’t waste one hour to waiting here .
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMS1qTThBRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,5,Great good and excellent service ! Value for money.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdC03SlRREAE,Dian Xiao Er,5,Yummy food paired with exceptional service
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjZ6TF9nRRAB,Dian Xiao Er,4,"Service is good, will keep remind you the new pour tea is hot.. food not bad and the food serving is fast. Place is clean and comfortable. Will come again"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjMWV1WEpBEAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,A pretty good meal with great tasting dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  I would go there again for sure 👍👍👍
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpZ05yQ1F3EAE,Dian Xiao Er,4,"Excellent Herbal Angelic duck, assam fish, baked cod fish fish maw soup. Good service. pricey though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHZ1BUaklBEAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,"great surprise to find a legit sichuan food restaurant in this area! The 酸菜鱼 is extremely affordable and good ($14), highly recommend! The cucumber side dish was a bit too vinegary for my taste though"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhNXFEOEd3EAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,5,"Delicious and affordable Chinese food. The quality is comparable to many fancy restaurants, at a fraction of the price. Below $50 for 2-3 pax. Highly recommend the boiled sliced fish, potato salad and pig ears salad. I bought their frozen dumplings previously - which were very good as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeWFiS0RnEAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,3,"no more xiao long bao :(

- skewers were nice but quite pricey. also the seasoning they use is the same, just the veggie is different. seasoning is VERY salty.
- chives & egg: looks totally different from the menu. portion is huge. no chives taste.
- la zi ji (辣子鸡) is fried popcorn chicken kind. so-so, i wouldn’t buy it again
- 饺子 is not bad, q big. $8 for 12"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd2FPQldnEAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,1,"Came here to eat instead of 福满苑餐馆 which is just a few blocks away as I saw the 烧烤 aka BBQ skewer.
Ordered the chicken, beef, pork and mutton, but taste like a really bad knock off version of the China skewers. (After my meal I did feedback to the boss which the boss just said ""of course China and Singapore spices different"").
Also tried the Jia Jiang mian and the fried La mian. Was really bad, even my China friend that was eating with me was like saying this is not China food!
Overall would say this is probably like localized food inspired by China dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LU91NGdnRRAB,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,3,"The price is pretty affordable. Ordered the sour vegetable sliced fish soup, portion is big enough for 3 at a decent price, but the taste is normal and is not flavourful enough to go with white rice. Tried the dried wok chicken and the parts is mostly boney, suitable for older people who likes to eat on bones instead of meat. Skewer is very small in portion, not recommend to order. The pork which return to the wok is average also, I find it's not spicy enough to go with rice"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdE1TNHpBRRAB,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,"Super worth it by taste, price and quantity comparison.
Diced spicy chicken was super delicious and fragrant.
Sweet vinegar pork rib was a little tough but still okay.
Five spice la mian tasted much better with the chilli's available.
Pigs ears salad was amazing! Spicy, crunchy and refreshing.
Chilli wantons could have been better if they added in more chilli oil and vinegar."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNnEzM3ZnRRAB,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,"Food is really not bad just that the staffs lacks EQ and abit rude. If you don't mind service and just want some food, this could be a possible choice"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvLWZmVVBREAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,"Extremely worth it lunch. 12 fat, juicy fried pork and vegetable dumplings for $5. Help yourself to the shredded ginger and vinegar at the condiment station.
Enjoyed the ma po tofu as well. It's not overly spicy, but has enough peppercorns for a good kick.
Their rice is also quite pearly and of good quality.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDbXJtMEtREAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,"Yummy dumpling and super affordable! Kailan also good but a lot of stalks✌. Overall, service was fast, staff friendly, however, should learn more basic english😊. Keep the foods tasty and affotdable."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRb0lpLWR3EAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,5,"one of most reasonable priced eatery in Yishun.  Managed by mainlander Chinese, the food is tasty (not salty), generous portions.  My favourites have been the cucumber side dish with garlic, vinegar and parley (great appetizer), the dumplings - steamed or fried are just as great and the noodles!!  There are too many to list out.  Try it out - before noons on weekdays and prepare to queue on weekends!!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdEo3ZzlBRRAB,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,2,Wanton soup is good but the mix meat ramen is not value for money as it is just a normal dry noodle with very little meat. Not recommended to try the met ramen

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdnZ1aGZBEAE,Xin Peng Chinese Restaurant,4,Nice food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MDdldUZnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,Nice Chinese seafood restaurant with good and prompt service. Offers Al fresco dining as well. Tried the crispy pork and roast duck and they were above expectations. Otherwise other dishes like chili crab were good but not great.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycjhTbkhBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Food here is better than the average Chinese restaurant, and there were certain dishes that stood out. One of them was definitely the hor fun which had a good wok hei and the sweetness from the vegetables really complemented the dish well. The duck was also really tender and the skin was crisp. I think the volcano chicken was average and the KL
Hokkien mee is definitely a miss from me. I sat indoors and the restaurant got a little stuffy as the lunch crowd came. Overall it’s a decent place to have a meal, but there’s limited parking available and reservations are recommended if indoor seating is preferred."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaklpYjlBRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"You know this feeling... when everything just went your way. Popped by for dinner with family after the ST article's  and boy, we truly enjoyed ourselves. Ordered the signatures and EVERY SINGLE DISH HIT THE SPOT for us. The outstanding ones are the sotong and lady finger chincalok, poached pork, KL dai lok mee paired with the oh so good and spicy sambal and the other ni. Ingredients are fresh, and the taste is natural just nicely balanced by the sauces and spices, without being overly salty, or sweet. Service is also impeccable, spacious and ambience makes for a fun evening dinner with good conversations.  Will definitely return to try the other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNXViXy1RRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"My first time dining in here and it was superb! It’s has the local Chinese restaurant vibe, place was immaculate and their staff were friendly and efficient. The menu had many varieties, like the geoduck sashimi which I thought was pretty cool! The food was fragrant and tasty, I really enjoyed the garlic pork and the duck! their de-shelled cereal prawn and dark sauce hokkien mee was good too. For dessert, we had mango pudding and I must say it exceeded my expectations. I’ll definitely come back here again and recommend to friends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eWQyR0VBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,"Was thinking this is a zicha place but didn't expect it to be a Chinese restaurant. And parking is super horrible here so please come here in public transport. Unless you're willing to pay for valet which is wth .... lol

But that aside, food is super good!! Every dish hits the spot, esp the yam ring, fried garlic pork and duck!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXODRQdURnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Very nice tasty dishes. Eveyone of us likes this place. Dessert was so-so on the other hand. Still, it's a good restuarant to patronise."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHenFDdktBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,"Been coming for quite a bit. The food is awesome and the service is superb. The outdoor dining ambience and decor makes me feel as if I'm in Phuket.
Do try the curry fish head... no regrets.
Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyejV6Wm9nRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,The duck is not bad... The pork chops here with the green chilli sauce are really delicious! 👍
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M2J5aXh3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"The lobster bee Hoon is very good, must try. Charcoal bean curd also unique and worths try"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ZzlDUi13RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,3,"Quite a gem to be located far from town. Served warmly local cuisine that we all familiar with in Zhi Char. The price commanded quite high compare to the standard of the food. Came here multiple times and probably I have tried the Irish such and field KL Hokkien noodle the best! Don’t miss these 2 dishes. The fry chives with prawn was disappointing. Prawn is way over cooked and taste hard. The fry fermented tofu pork is too dry.. over frying ! The chili cockles was so so as it is too small for you to feel shiok especially the sauce used wasn’t prepared well. The fry salted egg fish skin can be improved as the skin not as crispy. The pork collar is rather so so and bland. The ouster way too big to enjoy and not briny! Disappointing wither the soon hock fish, overcooked and the meat kind too tough and dry. The other plus point was the corkage is free and friendly restaurant owner to cheer with you from time to time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bnBtWG5nRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,Great food but a tad too costly. going through the menu u will find prices x2 x3 x4 of usual prices. I personally thought twice about many dishes that I would have love to try. I would frequent if the cost is a bit more reasonable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxdGV1WFRnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Enjoyed the braised lobster with bee hoon and leek ($120 for 1.2kg). The soup had a nice flavour. The spinach with three eggs was good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGV1ZWRBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Food is decent, price is at the higher side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMjhtRkJREAE,The Famous Kitchen,3,"Dishes were 50-50 hit and miss. Hostess at reception seem disorganised and covid precautions need to improve.
Service seems lacking on a busy evening (late to order, missing drink orders) but improved once other tables cleared."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMzdDR1JnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,3,"Food was decent. But in the middle after serving second or third dish, the food stopped coming for about 30minutes and children were left hungry and we were left waiting there for a long time when only half-done with lunch. In the end, we were told 2 of the dishes were OOS and we had to cancel."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NDRUUm93RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,1,"Having Chinese New Year reunion dinners in restaurants are rarely pleasant experiences. This year's experience was no better, despite a recommendation that Famous Kitchen's food was supposed to be good.

We chose the $318 menu for 4, and had to top up an additional $79.50 because its on a per pax basis and we totalled 5. No sharing. Fair enough, I thought.

We were told to be seated by 4.45pm as dinner will start promptly at 5pm. It started around 5.10pm when all tables were filled. We felt like we were in a Chinese wedding banquet. The food streamed in unison.

Salmon yusheng was fine. No surprises there.

When they dished out the crabmeat fish maw soup, it came in a small pot which hardly filled 5 bowls. It could have filled 4 nicely. And mind you we paid for 5 pax.

Fish was OK. No surprises there too.

Broccoli was over cooked. Mushroom was  soaked way too long. Sea cucumber was acceptable. Portion seems to be for 4.

Noodles was for 3 pax. No garnishing. Plain appalling and forgetful.

Dessert was sugary water decorated with bits of fungus and chestnuts.

Service started out fine, courteous and prompt in the beginning but ended up rushed. We felt as though the restaurant had run out of plates as they were clearing them as fast as dishes were served.

Sorry for the long post. For almost $500, it was outrageous and for a first timer visiting this eatery, consider it my last. I'm surprised a renown brand will wager their reputation to stage reunion dinners like these. Shameful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpc09YaHh3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"To be fair, I find it quite difficult to award 5 stars for take-aways as food quality is usually compromised during travelling but this restaurant deserves at least 4.5 stars. My family loves the deep-fried pork belly with fermented beancurd with garlic skin on. The noodles were a little on the bland side but that's okay because chilli padi and sambal sauces were given to complement the taste. The wok fried squid with chinchalok is a unique item on any zi char menu!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anNxLU53EAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,"A nice restaurant with great food. Love the cockles here and their fried garlic pork. Best of all, it is a good place to chill at the famous Hangout with these food to enjoy the sunset after a long day at work. Will be back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTMC1QNGF3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,"A Chinese restaurant located in a rather quiet and unusual part of Sembawang Road. Business was good though even on a Thursday night. Interesting dishes like preserved vegetables steamed fish, lobster Beehoon, and onion salad stood out from the rest.
My only gripe is the limited parking lots - I had to do valet parking."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaU5hTGJ3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,3,"We were there during Father's Day celebration. The service of restaurant is still great even though they were very busy. As for the food, I think the kitchen is overwhelmed, thus the standard is not as good as normal day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDc3ZiZEVBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Good food there especially the assam fishhead🥰 the service there is not good even though the owner kept talking to us but the waitress didnt serve the tea or change the plate as norm. The price is ok but consider the service than it’s not worrhy😉
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4ci1uOXFRRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,3,"Quite disappointing.. the food which i ordered here taste sadly poor compared to their sister restaurant at Capitol Piazza’s Famous Treasure. KL noodles is too sweet and no wok hei fragrant. Flower crab is having promotion, buy 1 get 1, is a joke. when serve on our table i really got shock of my life. Why? Is just so small small small. The crab size is like abt 1/3 size of wat i had at capitol.  Really sad is so small and the chef overcook it and the meat become dry and shrink. And taste really no match to capitol. The only best dish is the black tofu. Maybe the chefs specialized are different at different restaurant??"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyamUySHNBRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,Impressed by almost every dish! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😋😋😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzOHJIZjZRRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"We tried the CNY menu here and found the dishes very delicious. The chef combine chinese cooking from different region of china. From fish to roast chicken , surpringly good and yummy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdGJTN1B3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Not your usual tasting restaurant. Some dishes are possibly unique to them. Salt baked flower crab 4@52. Pretty good. 3.5ish to 4... Crab and pork with garlic are towards 4.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NDdxSFF3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Love the great variety of hawker food that are value for money and great tasting too! Definitely will revisit soon!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDl6UGRREAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,Nice foods and the laopan niang very friendly.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb2VhNzF3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"After long walk to Upper Seletar Reservoir and beautiful sunset view, the delicious food in this restaurant is a special bonus."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHNHSmtnRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,Very nice ambience with awesome dishes tastifully done.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDa1lULVB3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Had this seafood pot recently and its taste was really refreshing. Slightly sour and spicy at the same time. The ingredients were fresh and certainly goes with a bowl of white rice!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaVBEcXB3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"The Famous Kitchen!
Maybe due to covid issue, not much ppl dine in. Food here was nice. I had choose the KL Da lu mee, assam fish and dessert is the O née (sweet yam paste).
DA lu mee got enough wok hey, taste exactly like what I have tasted in KL.
Assam fish not so sour as what I like. Fish is fresh also.
Not to be said, till now I still miss the yam paste.
Those who see this post should go and have a try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJNHVubzJ3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"Good food at reasonable prices. Most impressed by the baked flower crabs. Very good har Cheong gai too. Salted veg fish stew is nice, but cost ~$100."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNjlhRkl3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,2,"There are some unique dishes that worth a try at the famous kitchen. However quite disappointed with one  ""unfresh"" flower crab that was mixed in our order!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3b2Z1NkNnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,"The restaurant has been here for quite sometime. A little gem with many signature dishes e.g. the KL Hokkien Flat Noodles, Sour Vegetable Steamed Fish, etc. My favourite dish is the salted baked flower crabs, which is not commonly found in the restaurants. You can get really big and meaty ones if the season is right. Another dish I have tried is the baked bee hoon which is as good as it sounds. Another of their specialty is the spicy chilli belacan. Bona petit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNEt5OVhBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,"We've been here on many occasions ever since we got to know of the restaurant from Michelle Chong's social media. The Sembawang restaurant is our usual go to. There's quite a plethora of dishes but somehow we always end up ordering (not in order of preference): chilli cockles, fermented beancurd fried pork, sour vegetables fish, any tofu dish, dai lok KL noodles 安salt baked flower crab. They have an extensive alcohol list as well, which we did not fully explore (being family occasions if I'm there) but for those interested, great place to pair drinks with their food too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMlpLd2tRRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,"Fresh and good crabs. Order the Sri Lankan crab if you go to avoid disappointment in case if full house booking.
We had chilli crab, pepper crab and butter crab. Crab meat was thick and yummy. The butter crab had crispy crumbs which were really good.  The chilli crab sauce was so delicious and the mantou to dip in...yum yum
Book in advance as restaurant could be full like our visit tonight."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydHNLd3VBRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,1,Quality of food has declined. What is that Michelin guide about? Plus - the cockroaches outside their establishment? Avoid this place. Mediocre tzechar fare at restaurant prices
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOHJ1Q01REAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Food is delicious.. live seafood.. nice service. Will definitely go back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZcmRMRkl3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,3,"I'm not sure about the high rating for this place, perhaps I didn't order the correct dishes or the dishes are not to my liking. The dishes I had were just okie - sweet and sour pork, Assam fish, french beans, fried chicken Italian style ?! (The sauce was strange ), corn soup, tofu and fruit platter. I prolly won't come here again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNzhqSW9BRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"The Famous Fried Rice I ordered was one of the best I've ever eaten. However, nothing else really caught my attention, but do keep in mind that I am a very fussy eater. The rest of the table agreed that the food was amazing and they also praised it for its generous portion and cheaper price.

If you plan to eat dinner here, either make a reservation or come extra-early or you will not manage to get a table. Nearly every large table had a ""Reserved"" sign on it when I walked in.

The parking spots right outside get filled up fast, and the closest alternative (slight farther down the street, behind the restaurant) costs 60 cents per hour. There is a valet outside the restaurant that will gladly help."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0dW9fSEd3EAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,Food is Good. Volcano Chicken is a must. Seafood is very fresh. Service is excellence.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTlhWHh3RRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,Good quality is quite good .. service is good too .. was there in the VIP room and service is really good and attentive too .. will patronise again
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdHUtYnFBRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,1,"Brought my family here on a quiet Monday afternoon. Place was as expected not crowded. Ordered the yellow chieve hor fan ($12) and hot plate tofu . Oh mine, was pretty speechless. The hor fan had no ingredients at all! Only bean sprout. The tou fu was so pathetic, that even the egg layer that comes with hot plate, was so paper thinly spread, that I suspect they barely used half an egg on it. For a moment, I thought I has ordered paper prata.

I am pretty sure this will be my last visit to this place. I had came before few years ago, and it wasn't this terrible to my memory. Perhaps the management had changed 🤔

The only saving grace to this place, is the lack of crowd, and the aircon 😀"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN0lpZmdnRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Reservations made online on Quandoo are not entitled to existing promos or discounts.. No reservations needed anyway, they are very empty."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eDVUVlNBEAE,The Famous Kitchen,5,Very good teochew-thai cuisine...can come often.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c2ZqLVVREAE,The Famous Kitchen,4,like the fried  pork belly in fermented sauce and garlic prawns and signature thick black KL noodles amd steam chicken
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdV9PSzVRRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,5,Had fish head curry. V awesome. Also took the pork belly which was super super awesome. Wish I took photos but would return. Many times.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNFkyMlpnEAE,The Famous Kitchen,1,"I don’t understand how this restaurant clocked 4.1 based on reviews. Neither the food or service is worth that much.

Came with 2 young kids in tow for lunch after a zoo outing.

I placed an order for crispy silver bait ( salted and pepper in direct translation) with less pepper sand explained that my kids don’t take spicy food. The dish was served  tossed with chopped chilli padi and rejected since the kids can’t take spicy food. Let’s take this as an oversight from the staff and move on.

The young server passed the dish to another waitress in bob hair and explained the situation. The bob hair waitress decided she need to investigate the situation and brought another 2  colleagues along to discuss. So, we had 3 persons standing at our table discussing while we were trying to have a meal. I find this behaviour to be unacceptable at a restaurant. Even busy cafes have better service standards.

The staff then tried noisily to sort it out with the kitchen which was situated 1 table away from us and separated by a folding screen. I couldn’t take it and feedback to the staff to sort out the issue quietly. The staff wasn’t able to understand my comment and brought back the bob hair waitress.

The bob hair waitress came back and defended her approach saying she needed to sort out the issue that’s why she had to look at the food order. I agreed but do it without fanfare.

She took the comment away and brought some colleagues to the folding screen to ‘talk’ about my comment. The folding screen blocks view ,not noise. I can hear everything that was being discussed. It’s unprofessional. An experienced customer service staff should conduct themselves better.

The food quality is average and portions are small. Hokkien Mee was their signature dish but it was a tad too sweet for my liking. Grilled pork portion was good but really small. There was a dozen slivers and certainly not the small chunks shown in the menu. The fried fish bait was nicely fried with no hint of pepper on its second try. Restaurant was only 20% occupied when I visited.

To be fair, the younger staff were diligent in changing plates, taking orders and serving customers. If the restaurant wants to do better, more attention needs to paid to its customer service level. Hire more qualified staff to lead the restaurant. The quality of food will not be able to attract returning customers. There are also stiff competition on the same stretch of road. Lots of cafes at Brooks I and Brooks II. Parking at the restaurant is also limited. We came at 12:30 and was able to secure a lot. Carpark was full when we left at 2pm.

Future goers, receipt attached. Even a MacDonald’s meal is more worth it. 吃了一肚子气和火

I just realised the receipt was changed to reflect the order as spicy. The original food order was printed less pepper. Not a honorable move by the restaurant. If the food order never reflected less spicy elected, I’m sure the waitress would not have entertained  me when I rejected my dish."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdmRqZHpBRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Enjoyed the food and service. They introduced 30-50% on signature dishes during the stabilisation phase so quite worth it. Had the curry fish head - half at $18++ portion was big. Garlic pork, squid with ladies finger also tasty."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDX2NEZmpnRRAB,The Famous Kitchen,4,"Nice food, finally found the closest KL Hokkien Noodle in Singapore"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb2YtVUJnEAE,Long Jiang Chinos,3,"Nice ambience. Only managed to try the sharkfin soup, fried squid and seafood bee hoon since only 2 of us. Food was OK but the sharkfin soup was served warm instead of piping hot. The bee hoon needs improvement. Price is acceptable. Service was OK. The craft beer was nice though not cold enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdU5Hdk9nEAE,Long Jiang Chinos,3,Nice open air ambience. Big restaurant with lots of dining space by the pond. Food prices are restaurant style steep. Food quality is alright.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOTkzVFRBEAE,Long Jiang Chinos,4,Nice Nices n good place for gathering.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRcjZIZlRBEAE,Long Jiang Chinos,4,"Great place to chill out with friends. Their seafood is pretty decent and fresh. I like the razor clam dish, they cooked just right and it's fresh too. This dish price is pretty cheap compare other seafood restaurant. Price is reasonable and service is okay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eDd5eG5BRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,4,"There are hits and miss on my visit to this restaurant. Firstly i made a reservation at 3pm on the same day dinner but was given a seat near the entrance away from the pond which i prefer. No Queue when i reached at 7pm as this venue can hold quite a number of patrons. Order was taken fast and served promptly. London duck was served tender with sweet mango sauce. But the pieces was cut rather huge with bones therefore tougher to eat with utensils. As for the spinach with eggs and clams, taste just so-so like any other zhi char. As for the triple mushroom with asparagus, it has a unique truffle flavour gravy which rarely found in other zhi char stores. The pomelo mango dessert was poor standard with dried pomelo and no mango cubes to bring out the sweetness of this dessert. If have the chance, should give a try to the other famous dishes from this past Google reviews."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajdlX1F3EAE,Long Jiang Chinos,4,"Very laid back atmosphere and fantastic food. Prices at the average seafood restaurant level. Chilli crab, prawn vermicelli, peking duck were pretty nice"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTZ01Ld3dBRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,3,"Service and ambience is good but I feel that the price is on the high side since the Trio Sauce Chicken had many pieces of bony chicken for $14. Taste is OK.
Best dish for us was three egg vegetable.
Hokkien mee was OK too but not much ingredients.
Overall, I think you are paying for the setting and service."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN1B6eHR3RRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,2,"Highly under staff. Service is very slow. Our cooked food took a while to reach and the beer comes later than cooked stuff, something that no need to cook comes later than the cooked ones is super weird. We need to call for the server a few times before we were ""noticed""."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMXF6X3NnRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,3,"Came here as a family group for birthday celebration. Food quality is expected given the price. Place is not crowded even though it is Sunday weekend lunch time. The server will share his opinions and to me may seem a bit too talkative. Otherwise I'll score it a bit more for service. There is no option for air conditioned seats so come prepared. BTW, it's now named tasty loong. Had problem finding the place until we noticed the new name plastered over the poster. It may be under new management.

There are other options available around the vicinity if you are looking for family friendly seafood restaurants so it's going to be tough for the rebranded restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cnA2dEx3EAE,Long Jiang Chinos,2,"Food was worst than I think. Rice were solid is nvm, but hard to chew and you might can swollow with water. The only thing I like is the deco of the table. **If you are not a fan of seafood or hate seafood, MY ADVISE IS NEVER EVER EAT IN THIS RESTRAUNT PLEASE!** It was horrific filled with seafood and I found meatless. Also, the rice I've mention earlier is fried rice, whoch wiol contain eggs, right? NO! Theres no eggs! Everything is meatless! Please for god sake if you hate seafood PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. That's all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwd2RyUnpBRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,4,Place says Hops&Belly but receipt says Long Jiang Chinos. Nice ambience at night. Quiet and peaceful.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDdGZIM3hnRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,5,Tasty food that is a highlight of the vicinity
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnelBXN2VREAE,Long Jiang Chinos,1,"We came for lunch on a weekday, it was almost deserted. Some dishes were fairly okay like the roast chicken. There was this salted fish tofu claypot that was quite odd and did not have any salted fish taste or bits.
Ambience is okay. Service could be improved. Some of the seafood or fish pricing seemed high."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTeXA3OWtnRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,1,"Order some dishes like vegetable, fish skin, fried rice and noodle. Fish skin is serve promptly but the vegetables are serve after 25min of waiting had to complain to the manager to get them to prepare the rest of the food which took more than 40min to serve fried rice .. the noodle is not even prepared yet.. had to ask them for plain rice for my son first while waiting.. guess we aren't paying enough for the restaurant to notice our order.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMm9tRVJ3EAE,Long Jiang Chinos,2,Cheesy crab bee hoon and clay pot mutton are pretty disappointing. The cheese seems to have overpowered the sweetness of crab in the soup. Mutton was just overly salty. Ordered 5 dishes at 6.30 but only finished the meal at 8.30 due to slow serving of food. Was a busy day evening for the staff and so had to remind them several times for our beer and food. Although the service staff did their best to be friendly and helpful but ultimately it is the food that we came for. Not worth coming.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdXY2Y3RRRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,4,Good place to eating.....enjoy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdi03ajVBRRAB,Long Jiang Chinos,4,Nice place to have a family dinner once awhile. Bring your clients to enjoy a local Chinese food. Surrounding environment is good by the big fishing pond at side.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxN051SUZ3EAE,Long Jiang Chinos,5,So far the best Chinese buffet I had. Going to book for birthday lunch or dinner and hope that they allow dine in by november

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtME1tUzVnRRAB,PUTIEN,3,"The food was nice but little bit salty for the noodles and their staffs are friendly. They are busy as business is good. Need to improve on their alertness, like refilling of tea. Raises my hands a few time, also cannot catches their attention, almost want to give them a call to fill my tea."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPanM2WldBEAE,PUTIEN,5,V awesome dining experience. Staffs were attentive and food were served fast. We had an enjoyable dinner. I like the soup alot. The restaurant even served free kid meal. cabbage mushroom rice with daopok as sides. Yam with duck was excellent too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1Nm9UOWZREAE,PUTIEN,5,"Putien (Northpoint City)
The food are serve very well, not too greasy nor bland. Absolutely the taste of Putien. Environment are suitable for family or friend to gathering. The waiters all serving us very well, they will keep on changing the dish for us to make sure we have a good experience to enjoy the food. It really feel like a VIP when we enter to the restaurant. Definitely will come back again"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbnNIM29nRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"I ordered the ‘100-Second’ Stewed Yellow Croaker on promotion for $8. The soup although little, is extremely sweet from the fresh fish. The fish is very soft and smooth with great texture but many bones. Not for those who are fearful of fish bones.

As indicated on their website, ""This signature PUTIEN dish is carefully boiled to precision at 100 seconds. It allows one to taste the true freshness of the yellow croaker. The original taste of the fish is accentuated, with the dish’s light seasoning of using onions, ginger, Fujian aged wine and Puning bean sauce. The perfect pairing of the tender fish with the sweet broth is best enjoyed piping hot upon serving.""

I also ordered another 2 seasonal dishes, Spicy Fried Duotou Clams (UP $26.80), ""Tossed over high fire, with just a touch of spice. A must-try!"" and Putian Farmhouse Clam Soup (UP $28.80), ""A traditional farmhouse recipe. Taste the delicate freshness of the clams in the soothing smooth soup."" Both dishes when ordered together is $43.80

Both dishes are nice. The soup is not too salty and I packed half the portion since I can't finish it alone even without rice. The Spicy Fried Duotou Clams is actually a stir fried dish. I decided to remove all shells before eating with the sweet garlic snd spring onions. To me, it isn't spicy at all, tasted just like a little light sprinkling of pepper.

The chrysanthemum tea ($3.80) is non-sweeten and refillable. I like it that they don't add sugar to it.

Overall, I had a quiet lunch as I went in before noon. The staff were polite and able to advise me on my selection how the clam should be cooked as they have 9 ways of preparing it.

The food tasted good without making me very thirsty afterwards. Be prepared to pay a little more for better quality food. I paid $65.45 for my lunch today. The portion is sufficient for 2 pax with rice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNnUyUmV3EAE,PUTIEN,4,"Been here a couple of times, round tables with cushion seat is quite squeezy for 7 adults + 2 kids, do request for non-cushioned seats for large group.

Lor Mee was fantastic as usual, standard is always the same. Must orders are the Braised Pig Intestines, Sweet & Sour Pork with Lychee, Stir Fried Yam.

Kids always have a set meal for them, usually either fried rice or porridge.

Desserts are veryyyy mehhhhh, can skip on this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaDdMZURREAE,PUTIEN,5,"Located in the North Wing of North Point Shopping Centre.
The service was good and attentive. The staffs would ensure the water was filled up, the food was served fast, emptied dishes were cleared fast. Didn’t expect that Putien service standard to be so high.
The dishes were good. The lor mee was fantastic, both the traditional (white colour) and the listed type on the menu (red colour) were very good. The clams cooked with salt were nice. Enjoyed the food very much.
Another great experience with Putien.
Excellent place to have a great meal."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM1BQRVBBEAE,PUTIEN,5,"One of our favourite family restaurant in SG. Staffs are all very professional, polite & leaves u a good impression. Restaurant is clean & cosy too!

Putien has seasonal menu. Other than the usual White Lor Mee, there's many other new dishes throughout the year. I love how innovative their menu planner is!

As for food wise, we always go for the White Lor Mee, Fried Tenggiri Fish, Shredded Pork with Sesame Bun, Bian Rou Soup etc. It's always sooooo good! My kids love the Fried Tenggiri Fish alot! They are always asking for more! Oh yes, I love how they slice (in cubes) the Tenggiri Fish before they fry it. This makes it easy for kids to consume! Btw they have FREE kids meal. It's a Cabbage rice with Braised beancurd & comes with a refillable barley drink.

Price wise I think it's reasonable given thar it's tasty & the portion is good for 2. I highly recommend u to Putien too!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtX2ZQNjdRRRAB,PUTIEN,2,"We were early 1105am so decided to wait for the restaurant as there were seats outside. 1 of the lady service crew came over as she was on her way out to the ladies toilet and ask in Chinese why are you here for? 你们来做什么？Obviously waiting for your restaurant to operate as you open at 1130am to have a meal on 人曰. 2 of my aunties were already saying then we come here for what if it’s not for lunch. 🙄 anyway the staff just casually replies by saying “you all know we operate at 1130am” we nodded. Hmmm…. I think she can put it in a nicer way lor. Anyway we order the set meal and food was acceptable. Btw, my 2 aunties are regulars at this branch as they pointed which staff recommended which dish and they both love it on their previous visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydnAtUktnEAE,PUTIEN,4,"My first time at Putien yishun. I have visited other outlets and service is consistent! Good as always. I usually start off with a cup of tei guanyin. My staple dish is lychee sweet and sour pork! We tried a different dish too this time, claypot steam beancurd. It is really delicious! Fried beehoon is also not to be missed! I would buy their beehoon and cook it at home too.
Crispy sesame bun with pork slices and onions is also really tasty! A place to go to when i have a vegetarian day too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZ2Q3VkpBEAE,PUTIEN,5,"Tried the cny takeaway with pen cai for 6 pax. The food was superb, the portion is more than enough for my family, and the service and care taken by the staff and chef was heart warming. The chef even asked if we were consuming within the next 30mins or later, and package/put in the ingredients in accordance. Thumbs up to the Chef and Pu Tien team at Northpoint."

Special mention on lor mee, starters, chilli and tea..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGNuWGd3RRAB,PUTIEN,4,"Had a quick lunch at Putien and looks like they had revamped the menu. I’ve asked to veganized these dishes and was pleased to find the dishes were still very flavorful and delicious.
Staff are well informed of the term vegetarian and vegan making the order taking such a breeze."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcGFQREVREAE,PUTIEN,3,"Food was not bad service of the person who brought us to out table was very good!

However the person who serve the dish just place our dish on the table loudly and have some kind of attitude. 😑 dropped the spoon the the table when putting the dish and did not even help us to pick it up and not apologetic at all.

The fruit platter for birthday was nice however the cherry tomatoes were not good and tip of it turning black. 😔 Disappointed."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbElXUHJBRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"This outlet has the best service so far. Putien’s staffs are generally very service oriented, you get good service at any outlet you visit. Am here for my favourite white cabbage soup tonight besides the usual good stuffs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dmN5cDdnRRAB,PUTIEN,5,Good for family and friends meal together. Food delicious. Loved the Braised Yellow 💛 Croacker fish the most.  And the fried Yellow Croacker. Excellent ! Cooked to perfection 😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdXVqV1ZREAE,PUTIEN,4,Nice food to try out.. it suits older generation as well so recommend to bring parents or grandparents for a nice meal!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPanM3dC1nRRAB,PUTIEN,5,Superb food quality and customer service as always. Food is served on time and hot. Never fail to impress me @ NPC.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaDRIUG53RRAB,PUTIEN,4,"July 2022: LOVE the durian dessert!! Unfortunately it is not often available - was really happy to be able to order it at this outlet. However, the durian paste was still frozen and too hard to eat. Had to use a lot of strength to break the durian cube apart to eat. I had it in another outlet and the instead was creamy and molten but yet still stiff enough to keep a cube shape."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NlpDRHJnRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"I've eaten at Putien many times, great meal each time. This is the first time ordering ""to-go"", and I'm reviewing during covid time when quality and service matters the most. The food were packed in an insulated bag. Container material and design was of quality, the sweet and sour sauce was separated from the meat (not shown in photo). Chopsticks were solid wood. I really appreciate the restaurant's position to maintain the quality in their food and brand. 👍🏼"

Took initiative to offer fruits and freebies and plated out the birthday cake which we bought. The team even sang song for us and prepared a hat made from balloons. After that, they helped us pack the leftovers nicely. Best service and comparable to 海底捞..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdTQzYnF3RRAB,PUTIEN,5,The service today is excellent! Has a team lunch here. From food recommendations and attentiveness of service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXZiTWJnEAE,PUTIEN,5,"Had a pleasant birthday dinning experience. Food is great (not too salty). Particularly liked the yellow croaker fish, which is very fresh and tender. The service staff went the extra mile to play the birthday song and sang birthday wishes with us. They also gave us a free fruit platter."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaDVTS3lnRRAB,PUTIEN,5,Superb food and service! Food is not too salty nor sweet it’s really palatable and feels healthy! Service is also good and staff are all very friendly! Would like to commend a staff Wei Li Hui as she provided exceptional friendliness and does check up on customer food and service satisfaction. Overall I recommend people to dine in at Putien Northpoint!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMW9uVXhnRRAB,PUTIEN,4,"Good food though a bit on the salty side.. service also can give 4.5 stars out of 5.. but the last month I went, I saw they did not have a separate container or bowl to keep the scoop when serving the fried rice dish. Instead the scoop was placed beside the bottom of the pot. Which I think is not so hygienic, given the fact that the fried rice has been on a burner before. Hope the restaurant can take not please."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1c3RyYW1nRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"The best putien outlet in Singapore. Food is delicious, service is fantastic, servings are generous. Very attentive staff. There are a lot of food options at Northpoint but we have been coming here almost every other week for the past 3 years. My daughter loves the friendly staff and food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNzVTU0h3EAE,PUTIEN,5,"Nice food, experience and services at PUTIEN. The staff were attentive and served tea to us. Sweet and sour pork and the fish was yummy. It was quite warm so the staff gave us a small fan, great service!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLak1Tejh3RRAB,PUTIEN,5,"This is an example of good food accompanied by excellent service. I have been to several Putien in Singapore but I have to give a shoutout to the outlet in Northpoint City. They deserve the Michelin 1 star. They pay attention to the details (e.g. when I was holding a cake, the staff proactively asked if I needed him to place it in the fridge) and were generally friendly, helpful and attentive to requests.
Really good job to all the staff in this outlet on 1 2 May 2021! 👏🏻👏🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTbGRQZzVnRRAB,PUTIEN,4,"Had a family celebration for my dad's birthday at Putien because he craves for Chinese food. We all had a good meal with our favourite dishes ordered. Generally being a Fujian Cuisine, the dishes are fresh, light and taste flavourful 👍🏻.

- Fujian Lor Mee $10.90
- Steamed Prawn with Minced Garlic $24.90
- PUTIEN Sweet & Sour Pork with Lychees $14
- Deep-fried Eggplant Dressed with Pork Floss $11.90

Tried 3 of their Oyster Festival Dish, the bee hoon is shiok when soaked in the lor mee gravy, would be better if the oysters are bigger!

- Pan-Fried Oysters coated with Bee Hoon S$16.90
- PUTIEN Crispy Oysters S$17.90
- Oyster Pancakes $5.90"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa3FLRm5nRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"Great dining experience at Putien Northpoint. The food was delicious and the service team was amazing. It was a fantastic way to celebrate my grandmother's birthday, especially because the staff were really attentive and welcoming to her. Would highly reccommend this place to everyone!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aGFmYjJRRRAB,PUTIEN,5,"My family always brings guests here because the quality is consistently good. Service also two thumbs up (unless it is crowded, then it takes a while for the food to be prepared and served...so go early!). Comfortable atmosphere too. Even though it is in a heartland mall (Northpoint), the quality is still good.

So far almost all the dishes we've had are delicious. I've probably had 1 or 2 that weren't good but that's normal for every restaurant. The thin bee hoon and lychee pork ribs are staples for us. There is also a green juice that looks like a health drink, but I promise it tastes 10x better.

We brought a couple who just got married there, and the manager carved a pair of swans from a watermelon rind as a surprise. So sweet.

Putien isn't cheap but worth the occassional splurge!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlblpQSkRREAE,PUTIEN,5,The service is tip top. My table serving waitress 静雪 service was professional n warming! The rest of the teamwas caring and always ready for any request. Great place to spent the evening with family or friends.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXIteXd3RRAB,PUTIEN,5,Good! Very healthy! Suitable for old people.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPczYteXV3RRAB,PUTIEN,1,"Went with 5 people, waiter did not clarify and ordered the 6 pax set meal when we intended to get the 4 pax one. Aircon spoilt and it was hot inside. Was celebrating birthday and waiter offered longevity bun, did not mention it was chargeable and I ordered it thinking it was complimentary. Food was not nice and overpriced for $400"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdkphdFV3EAE,PUTIEN,5,"Likely what sets this place apart is the service. First time at putien and noticed the great service. We received a free chilli bottle per person as they’re celebrating their 20th anniversary. Food was slightly pricey but the quality was definitely higher quality yet with better higher quality ingredients. Worth to try the Yam, Sweet and sour pork."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNzlUVU9BEAE,PUTIEN,5,"Service is amazing — it is top notch. They even asked for feedback on the food and shared with me bad feedback from other customers when I offered them good feedback about the luffa.

The luffa and the fried tenggiri fish (with its accompanying sauce) blew my mind. The luffa was soft and absorbed the delicious superior stock very well. I never knew vegetables could taste so good.

Their in house chilli had depth in taste and was refreshing to pair with any dish.

I absolutely enjoyed my experience there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNGZUV0dREAE,PUTIEN,2,"Had a very bad experience today because of the incompetence of the service lady. I wanted to order large Lor Mee to ensure that it is enough for my family of 4 and asked if large is sufficient. The lady then advice me to go for medium if I am afraid we cannot finish. I then point to the menu and ask for the price of medium since I only see regular and large. The lady then assured me there is a medium but could not tell me the price even when I probed.

After a pointless exchange, we decided on large and thought that it means the large on the menu ($20+). When we were served, we were surprise that the standard pot was not big enough and our order came in 2 pots. At this point, I still did not sense anything wrong as I seldom dine in Putien and thought this is normal practice for large size Lor Mee.

It was only when I made payment that I realised the order was extra large and the price is not even stated on menu. I was so angry as I clearly wanted large. However it was too late since we already consumed the food and even take away the leftovers.

At the same time, we attempted to cancel a drink that we ordered but was not yet served. However, we were taken aback by the rude reaction from one of the service lady and her refusal to help us cancel the order. I have to compliment the male manager who intervened and help us cancel the order after he overheard the conversation.

I really did not expect such an experience and find this unacceptable for an established restaurant. Very disappointing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aEpqaGt3RRAB,PUTIEN,4,"Visited Putien multiple times .
This is the first time during CNY .
There were a few packages for CNY set meal.
Food was good . Service is excellent 👌🏻
Definitely worth to try at least once for authentic Putien cuisine 👍🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b3JYOExREAE,PUTIEN,5,"The best service and delicious of restaurant I had been. Last week we went to that the restaurant at Mbs, very poor service and the staffs not smiling to welcome…but when we walking-in this Northpoint Putie, they shown the efficiency management under the leader, provided  good services, all staffs are friendly, nicely and closely with each table . We highly recommended and definitely will be come back soon!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MEszXzJBRRAB,PUTIEN,1,"Writing this makes me really upset because i was here yesterday to celebrate my mom's birthday. This place is an absolute disappointment and has horrendous customer service. First off, called for a reservation for 20 pax at 830pm because people are coming from work and hence the late timing. However, the staff on the phone kept insisting and being so pushy with me by telling me that I should come earlier because the last order was at 930pm. Not only that, they do not respect my boundaries as they wanted to confirm my table by spam calling me 5 times while i am at work.

Then, managed to get everyone to come earlier and the waitress was so pushy towards the items we want to order by saying we should get abalone dishes. However, not everyone likes to eat such dishes because we have people that are not local and Chinese which doesn't suit their taste. But the staff was super insistent about it which cmon, once again be professional. You guys are a Michelin star restaurant.

The worse of all, dishes came out so fast that every time each waitress comes, 4 dishes comes out at the same time. You got to pace the food timings because if you rushed all the dishes out, the other dishes are going to be cold and it affects the texture, taste and quality of the food. Then, staff still argued that they have no control over this. Cmon, you obviously can just tell the chefs at the back to slow down with the food. I know you want to faster get your job done and close the shop early but we are here celebrating and we arent that unreasonable to stay till late night. Also, We are ordering approximately close to 10 dishes for each table and food got to be served at a moderate pace. Worse of all, staff even went to argue and retaliate against our request. Is this even reasonable?

To end off, my family have been spending at least hundreds of dollars every visit  when we come to putien because we find that food is decent, a nice location to be and also a place my family can bond together. Yet, none of the staff remembered us and this place does not value their regular customers. Very disappointing really..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJNTdPSFlREAE,PUTIEN,5,"The first thing that stuck me was their excellent service. The receptionist answered  our queries patiently even before we went in.

We ordered a set lunch for two. The food was good, not too salty. The portion is reasonable, enough to leave with a full stomach. Highly recommend their soups which come with rich broth that makes one want to have more.

The restaurant also provided free food for my toddler. We asked for more rice as she was not full and that came free of charge too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MmRxazB3RRAB,PUTIEN,5,"Food is really good here! Love the Lor Mee and the Lychee Meat 🤩 would like to commend Zhang Lan too! She’s so nice and friendly, dish she recommended us is really v nice! Nice dinner on mid week, made our day! :)"

Nothing expected from them but they went extra miles to ensure we are well attended. Definitely a great place to visit again."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdDh2YmRBEAE,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,5,Looking for something different for lunch today and found this great place with ample parking. The dishes are excellent and reasonably priced. There is a 10% service charge and justifiably so as service is prompt and good. Will definitely come back.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ3JhRGh3RRAB,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,3,"So so, some dishes pretty good some not so. The Mango London Duck taste weird wz the artificial mango essence sauce and the Braised Pork Belly got the pork smell. The Icy Sweet n Sour pork was good, but the ice melted when it was serve causing the meat to be sitting on a puddle of water. Black pepper beef was good too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z2RmbUV3EAE,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,4,Waiters and Waitresses were standing nearby and served promptly whatever necessary and polite. The taste of Crab and fish were from gravy. The fish seemed to be not marinated and the crab seemed to be boiled separately and gravy was poured on top just before serving.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPejVXaThRRRAB,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,5,Zichar style but Food was really unique and good! Nice vibe to chill with family and friends. Beer tower is not the cheapest. The staff were attentive and friendly too! There are also many small bites options if you just want to chill there with beer after dinner. My favourite are the fried baby squid and fish roe seafood fried rice (served in stone pot).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeDdleU1REAE,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,4,"Dine in with group of 5 you can order more dishes. Chili crab price consider reasonable at $88. The vermicelli is something different than other zhi char stall and it taste good with all the seafood. They also serve flaming roasted chicken which we skipped this time as we wanted to have prawn. The crispy garlic prawn is so good that you may have the crispy garlic and rice and chili crab sauce on its own. It’s just so staple. Overall their food are ok, restaurant is clean, it’s very suitable for gathering. They are not air conditioned but under shade. They also have outdoor table which I was initially have interest on but pull back as it is only cater for smoking zone. How nice if they have some non-smoking outdoor tables which people can eat/drink and enjoy the surroundings openly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDlMelpnEAE,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,3,Great place to gather for dinner and some drinks. The white and brown fried rice was surprisingly good. The black tofu and London duck were average. Try the satay (not on menu); every stick was generous with meat and had a good bite to it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZ2VPOXl3RRAB,Tasty Loong at Orto Park 龍鲜閣,2,"Overpriced for what we were being served.

The Peking duck was cut in a corner and then served to us, already wrapped. It would be a better experience if patrons can wrap their own Peking duck. Some of us didn’t want the spring onions so we had to pick it out. The skin was soggy and oily by the time it was served too.

My soon hock fish was served undone. We had to send it back to the kitchen to re-steam the fish.

Overall food - so so. Don’t think I’ll go back again."

Decided to have our lunch there again today and I am retaining my 5 stars rating for them. Service wise, do not expect the kind of standard that you would find at DTF or HDL but it is generally acceptable to me considering the staff demographics. Food wise, i would say it is still pretty good, well presented, reasonable portions and good taste. The stir fried beef cubes and signature bee hoon were great."

Service staff are very attentive and friendly. They are patient when explaining their dishes. Thumbs up to their service manager.

Food: 1/5
1. Mushroom Tofu
Probably the better dish but they are a seafood restaurant?
2. Shark Fin Soup
Generous portion of shark Fin but the soup was a disappointment
3. Dancing Roasted Chicken
It was fine, not great.
4. Salted Egg Crab
Honestly, this was what I was looking forward to - the sauce and crab were not in the same building; disappointing.
5. Opeh Leaves vermicelli
Really big time disappointment. the vermicelli had a strange taste.

Ambience: 3/5
A nice place in the evening. quite cooling.

Price: 2/5
For the price you pay, you should get better food.

Final Verdict: Don't bother."

ORTO has been one of the few places I was recommended to go to that changed my perception of the North and the place itself has a nice view to boot. I love the fact that you can dine either indoors or alfresco depending on your mood and the food at Tasty Loong didn't disappoint. It was just unfortunate there was only the 2 of us so you guessed it, the more people the merrier as that means you get to savour more dishes. Their pumpkin noodles was their signature dish and it's a popular one but I felt it was nothing much to shout about. However their braised pork belly was good and certainly a dish I would order again! I have yet to try their roast chicken but judging by the no of the same dish sent to various tables, it must be popular too. Can't wait to head back there and try their dim sum menu too!"

After long time we decided to have crab but this restaurant dashed our hopes, after almost 1 hour of waiting patiently, they gladly said they haven’t started preparing our crab, why not just tell at entrance how long one has to wait for an item.

I have been here a couple of times, and my personal favourites are the porridge, ban mian and the fried oyster. This time, I tried the nasi lemak, which unfortunately wasn't very good. I also noticed that the claypot rice had a long queue.

Remember to ask for the chilly samba, it brings out the full favour of the Lontong soup.
Generous serving of cabbage, Kueh Tupat, boiled egg but the long bean is missing, double check the display photo. Can see the long bean missing from my Lontong?

Comes served in the traditional yellow glass plate. Don't see that kind of plates any more but popular in the 70's in the Malay Kampong.🙂

The Chendor beside the Nasi Lamak stall is also my fav stall. Always ask Ice Chendor additional Gula Malacca syrup and NO RED BEAN TOPPING....BUT MUST Have the Green Chendor......mmm...super Manis.

Rojak was decent, slightly on the sweeter side.  The vegetables fruits like radish, cucumber, guava were fresh and crunchy.  The youtiao had a crunch as well. The pineapples were unripe.

Popiah was similar, since the sweet sauce was the same base, over powered the salty fragrance that the cooked radish would have provided.

Lontong was rich and tasty.  The saving grace for the meal.  The gravy had the right richness and taste that made you want to dig in more.  The Tau kwa was generous.  Portions were right for 1 pax.

Oyster omelette was the first to order and last to receive.  The cook on the starch was poor and ""jelak"".  The oysters over cooked and the chili was ""off"" with a rancid water taste.

By the time that we were done by 810, we wanted to order hot drinks, the man at the counter said. No more hot drinks.

Though customers said ok, the staffs would still repeatedly shout that it require waiting time to order lontong. I ordered the nasi lemak takeaway, instead of handing over the food to me like any usual F&B staff would, he appear to be throwing the entire packet of food in plastic to me.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdjd2cGpBRRAB,Malaysia Boleh! @ Northpoint City,5,"*This review is specifically for this dish only.

Taste:
This is one of the best chilli ban mian I have eaten.
The noodles texture is chewy and bouncy, the mushroom and the egg yolk taste combined is just perfect.

Price:
Pretty decent, I can’t remember the price, but this is definitely below $5.

Service:
Dined at a pretty odd hour after the common dinner timings so there are still seats available. For this specific stall, the food was served pretty quickly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NU8yTk93EAE,Malaysia Boleh! @ Northpoint City,1,Hi management would like to highlight an issue isit a rule that char kway teow must always fried with chilli? Your people got a lot of own rules that I think the management are not aware. The other time the jurong point char kway teow refused to sell me 2 plate as I only have a $50 note which later the jurong point management apologies that there is no such rule.  Please look into it

Not all their foods are great, so you need to choose wisely. My favorite foods here are chilli ban mee (noodles) and char kuey teow. The popiah, nasi lemak, penang hokkien mee (prawn mee) are so so only.

If you come during meal time, it will be very crowded and you need to share places with others. My advice is come early or choose odd times to come here, so you won't be frustrated with all the fully occupied places."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcEszMGlnRRAB,Malaysia Boleh! @ Northpoint City,5,"Malaysia Chiak! gives a very warmth environment to me with it's warm lightings and spacious seats.

The prawn mee I had is so tasty with very good soup base and fresh ingredients. The presentation is also attractive. The service is just nice for me. It also reminds me of the taste of prawn mee in Malaysia.

Their chendol ice is so so good! Red beans were big and juicy. The ice makes it chilled and crunchy. The chendol is also soft and smooth. The coconut milk also adds fragrance. Overall it's delicious!

I would highly recommend you to try their prawn mee if you are missing the taste of the prawn mee and chendol from Malaysia!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnM0p2UC1nRRAB,Malaysia Boleh! @ Northpoint City,3,Latest Malaysia hawker food themed restaurant in Singapore. Lots to choose from and stalls display famous roads to state  exactly where the dishes come from. I wonder if this is really the case. Prices are not cheap. It’s like paying premium for the name and air con. Char kway teow could pass off as Penang char kway teow but lacked hum and lup cheong. Penang laksa was chock full of vegetables. Quite close to the real thing although I probably didn’t try this style before. Chendol had the right taste but ice shavings were not fine enough.

A pity that this is located at B1 and all the way at the far end of Northpoint City. Hopefully more ppl will patronise and support the biz."

One could be deceived by the colour of the soup which gave the impression that it was briming with taste. There was a grand total of 2 to 3 small chucks of pork and a maximum of 3 thinly sliced pork belly. Portion was small. $6 for that tiny serving and $1 more if you want a bowl of rice.

I’ve also added on fishcake and begedil but the portion was so small. Chicken wing was tasty and flavourful but the winner here for me was still the rice. 😬"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3ZDMWl3RRAB,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,4,"Went there around 9am on a Sunday morning and there was a long queue. Most of the people buy in bulk of 5 to 10 packets! The worker is very fast but because of the high volume, you still need to be prepared to wait for 20 minutes or so.

We ordered the nasi lemak and also the curry puff (3 pieces for 2 dollars). Not bad - crispy skin and tasty generous fillings. Took a photo with a standard rubik cube for size comparison.

The nasi lemak rice is fluffy and fragrant. The fried ikan bilis and peanut is very fresh and crunchy. I like the chicken wing too - crispy on the outside and the batter is very thin so you are still eating the chicken wing and not the batter :p.

The sambal is the sweet type but lacking in omph. That is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGFlc0xnEAE,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,5,"The best food court nasi lemak in town, no other place can beat Nasi Lemak Pak Mandor. Pandan rice and sambal are the best ~ I can't describe it well by words, kepak chicken wing had a perfect nice crisp, similarly with the ikan ekor kuning which is very tasty, perkedel or begedil is always tasty as ever.

I would strongly recommend to dine in or if take out, to eat it right away while its warm.

Been their loyal customers since ages and their nasi lemak never disappoint me, always able to maintain the taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXem8zWEVBEAE,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,5,"Grew up eating this and the standard is still the same as ever. The rice is always soft and fluffy. Chilli is on the sweeter side and must must must ask for more chilli to fully enjoy the whole meal.

Fish is easy to eat and not dry! Chicken is okay, great when its piping hot but when cold it becomes tough so do eat it immediately.

Always add Begedil! Love this, veryyyy yummy.

Have it there or dabao come also equally good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM3YtOE1nEAE,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,3,Its ok only. No cucumber. Rice a bit soft maybe cause I take away. Sambal is sweet not spicy. I dont understand people raving about it. Maybe they never taste a good nasi lemak before. I give it a five out of 10.

However I didn’t fancy the rice with mushy texture and coconut flavour quite like. Also the chilli is not spicy. As other said, abit like Chinese Nasi lemak

So if you Wan to try non spicy Nasi lemak. This is it. And yes there’s a queue even on weekdays"

Everything is simply cooked but because it’s fresh, the taste is different from (and better than) other famous Nasi Lemak places, the chili from Changi Village and Adam food center are still better though.

1. The pandan green colour rice looks good but didn't even have a hint of pandan fragrance in the rice. I wonder if they're using pandan colouring instead of natural pandan leaves?

2. The rice they used seems like low quality as it is firm and dry.

3. Chilli is too watery and doesn't blend well with the rice.

4. Chicken wing is too tiny like a quail

5. Tempe and fish is so-so"

Small cup of green nasi lemak rice. Price though was the deciding factor for the 26 odd people in queue on a wednesday afternoon at 12pm. 40 minutes in queue. Will i crave for it again? No. Was there anything else in the coffeeshop for alternative eating? No."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHFienVRRRAB,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,1,Waited 30 mins in line and they had only move 7 people. Slow service because they committed to a massive pre order they couldn’t keep up with. After each customer they would have to pack 5 packs for the pre order. Worst experience.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXb3BIOXdRRRAB,Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak,5,"A favorite since I was a child. Delicious and value for money. My usual order with double chicken wing costs less than $5. The sweet sambal (Indonesia style?) is relatively unusual compared to the norm.

My cucumber was also missing from my plate. Not sure if it was intentional or not. The green lemak rice was a nice touch but it was nothing great. Price is reasonable at $3.50.

Also note to be there early and expect a queue which however clear fast as they are really quick at service, they are usually sold out by 2pm everyday.

And the staff, they are just.... HAPPY. The positive vibe from the crew just makes eating there a joy!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdG8ySnlnRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Ordered Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang for lunch. Also added a fish fillet because I am greedy! Haha! 😂 The chicken meat was so tender and it fall off the bone easily! But for someone like me with low tolerance to spice, the chilli was very spicy and I broke out in sweat after a few spoonfuls of it! 🔥🥵 Overall it’s really a good and tasty Nasi Lemak in Yishun so please consider to give it a try if you are here! 😋"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeFBiZjRRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"Ordered Nasi Lemak Cabe Ijo. Cost $6.20. Potion is good, very filling. Chicken is good and tender, not dry but juicy.. The green chili sauce is good also comparable to 小辣 mala spicy level. Sambal chili is nice and sweet. Nasi Lemak taste fine good enough for me, egg was also nicely cooked. Only negative was the ikan billis that was overcooked. Other than that I will return to eat."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNzliRTdnRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"First time patronizing this stall.

Went on a weekday at 2.30pm timing. Was quite surprised to be told to wait 10 mins even though there is no queue. Food came faster then 10 minutes though. So I will expect pretty long waiting time during peak hours and on weekends.

Food wise,  taste is pretty good. Chili was not too spicy for me which is good and quantity given is good too. RIce is fragrant, Chicken is not overcooked and tastes good also.

At $6.20 is not that expensive compared to other stalls selling similar style of food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOF9tdlBBEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Excellent nasi lemak eatery. The quality is one of the best around compared to other popular ones like Crave or Qiji.

The rice is especially fragrant and moist. The chicken leg is very tender and tasty. The fish is also very large size and overall for the price, it’s value for money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eVpUUGdRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,Tried the green chili chicken nasi lemak. Chili is good for both the sambal & green chili ones. Rice is fragrant too. Chicken is nicely grilled but the flesh when eaten is bit mushy? Not thawed correctly? Will still return for other flavors though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcXBydUhREAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"One of the better Nasi Lemak is Yishun. The chicken wing is big, crispy on the outside and the inside meat is juicy but I feel that it is not marinate long enough. The mackerel otah taste good. The egg is a bit overcooked as I prefer egg with a bit of runny yolk. The portion of the sambal chill is generous. The only thing which I don't prefer is the rice, something seems just not right whenever I eat the rice as I feel it don't have have the very distinct coconut milk flavour and aroma of pandan leaves which a good nasi lemak should have."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLUx2NlFBEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,Delicious Nasi Lemak! Sambal isn’t the spiciest but they portioned a generous amount of it. Chicken is crispy and other ingredients were nice too!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtd05xREh3EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,Is nice but not excellent at $6.20 per plate.  They could have given more sambal chilli to serve with the rice.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMzVYVklBEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"The rice was well cooked and fragrant, the star of the show is of course the chicken. Nicely charred and tender, coupled with their house made chilli (pleasurable burn). Ikan bilis was just a tad too salty for my liking. I would come back just for their chicken 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bnV6TDJBRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Very shiok spicy, chicken was tender and rice was very very fragrant! The ikan billis was too hard for me though. Highly recommended!"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbXNEbU5BEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,"I liked the egg. It’s runny on the inside and coats the rice nicely when you break it. Begedil had a crispy touch to it. Other than that, the ingredients and taste is not as good as the more famous ones like Crave."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2aF9lN1d3EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,"Saw a crowd and decided to queue for the Ayam Taliwang. There were 4 people in front but I had to wait 20 mins for them to take my order. The cashier processed my order and asked me to come back after 15 mins.

15 mins later, when I collected my food, he told me they have ran out of the Ayam Taliwang, and convinced me to switch to another sauce. Quite disappointed cause I waited so long and paid already. The food is ok only, definitely not worth $6.50. Rice also not that fragrant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWJLa253RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,Happy fun loving two ladies in the morning not to mention plus points great food.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1a1B2U3d3RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Would rate 9/10 for the nasi lemak sold! Would have rated 10/10 if not for the pricing! It's a little too expensive but overall, the nasi lemak is delicious. Definitely it's a must to try! They have few other shops too!"

Their Rice was fragrant. Sambal Chili is tasty and NOT too spicy. The chicken wing however the taste was so so...Average. Their Deep Fried Potato was good though. Overall i gave 4 stars ...Very good....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbU1Hb2J3EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"I have eaten many nasi lemaks in Singapore, but none of the nasi lemak can compare it to Malaysia.  This is the only nasi lemak I really feel it's so delicious!  The sambal is really spicy tho! It's better than Chong Pang Nasi Lemak. Will definitely return to order again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeWRDdUZREAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"Service is nice. Chilli is nice esp for chilli lovers (still spicy though).

Ordered the Ayam taliwang. Chicken is tender but at same time some parts are abit dry n over cook. Nonetheless will still come back to eat if I’m in area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa29iX29nRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"This food stall located at the Yishun Park hawker Centre is a pioneer in this dish - the Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang. They combined the traditional Nasi Lemak with one of Indonesia's unique chicken dishes, the Ayam Taliwang.

The chicken for this dish is grilled but the sauce or sambal which makes it truly unique on its own, the Taliwang Sambal. Their rice is absolutely fragrant with coconut milk and the chicken is tender and juicy!

They also have other varieties of Nasi Lemak and also side dishes which you can add-on. All in all, they are an affordable place to get great quality Nasi Lemak!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aU52bzhBRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"Tender chicken spicy sauce. Food is fresh and tasty. Portion is reasonable. However during peak hours expect a Q just to order, then another 10mins for the food to be ready."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNN2V5UG5nRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Excellent grilled chicken rendition of nasi lemak. Smoky and tender. The service was good on a Sunday lunch time. Sambal was more sweet than spicy but the one on the chicken made up for the spiciness. Only wished the egg yolk would be runny.

My wife tabaoed this another day but after 45 mins, the chicken wasn’t as nice. Nonetheless, 5 stars if u r having it there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxNmNHcDNnRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,Mine is at Canberra quite nice full of ingredients ...price also reasonable .however the chilli a bit bitter and not spicy must improve la .the rest still ok but rice not coconut a bit normal. as it's raining Day I taopao
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVck4zajRRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"The star dish, Ayam Taliwang is blessed with a chili that is a veritable storm of spiciness stir fried in with the fragrant dried shrimp. More power than Boon Lay's nasi lemak if you're looking for a kick!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDa3JTWXBBRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"20/09/2020  - Ordered via Grabfood on 19/09/2020, 1pm++ (Tampines).  These are what I received (1st 3 images), all overnight food.

21/09/2020 - Owner left mobile number for me to contact him and send me a replacement with extra chicken wings on the same day I contact him (last image). There is great different in the items. And those in the last image should be their normal standard (but not Tampines Branch)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBMEllYk53EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,This stall sells on hybrid between Nasi Lemak with Taliwang grilled chicken (one of Indonesian speciality dish).. the coconut infused rice is very tasty and the grilled chicken is tender.. the staff also very friendly..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NHYzUjR3RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Tried this for the first time last month as it was the top rated food around the area. Glad to say that it lived up to its review. Staff were friendly for a hawker outlet and food was tasty but just take note the sambal chilli is very hot for those who are unable to take spicy food recommend smaller portions of chilli, it’s really spicy even for my standard and I really enjoy spicy food. Overall I would say I was blown away by how much I actually enjoyed it idk whether I was lucky I got a fresh batch but it was nice and I really enjoyed it. Thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNE9HUzlRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,Chicken was tender and flavourful. Chilli very spicy but shiok la. Recommended!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bV8zSU9nEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,Quite a nice Nasi Lemak. Rice not as fragrance though. Overall quite good and expect some queue.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbE9USDJRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,One of the better stall in Yishun Park Hawker Centre. Love the fragrance coconut milk rice and fried chicken wing
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtME9LdU9BEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Been craving for a good nasi lemak for a while now. Had the set K and was blown away, the chili was spicy but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Such a generous portion of chicken and sambal.Even the bergedil was spot on.  Finally coming across nasi lemak sambal that is not sweet. Wayyy better than crave !!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdWNpcWh3RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"One of my favourite eats at this hawker centre (Kalsom Kuih Muih is my other must-visit for their curry puffs). My favourite selections are the ayam taliwang belado and the nasi lemak with everything. The belado comes with a well seasoned, spoon-tender grilled chicken leg. Nice smoky flavours go well with the two chilli sauces, one sweeter one for the coconut rice (not overly lemak) and a spicier, pedas coarsely textured chilli for the chicken. They will pack the chilli separately in individual containers if you need to manage the spicy level."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OTdDSXN3RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,Very good nasi lemak and fast take out delivery service too. 👍👍👍

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdlBialp3EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,Really tasty and the waiting time was 7 mins for a succulent chicken thigh. Worth the wait. Thanks for the great lunch!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX0t5WmRBEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,4,"Truly enjoyed the meal..ordered the ayam taliwang set. The main sambal is not overly sweet which i like..but the taliwang sambal was the best ..spicy and punch a kick. Asked for extra main sambal added with no extra cost..wanted to add the taliwang sambal too but felt so 'paiseh' to ask..lol. the grilled chicken was pretty decent , a good heathier alternatve to fried ones.
4 stars is because felt the rice could have been more grainier it was a little mush..but still nicely flavoured with a hint of lemongrass and coconut"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OW9xZXZnRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"We have tried ayam talibang, chicken wing nasi lemak, twice at Yishun Park, once at tampines... All Met our expectation  well.  The rice exceeds many stalls we have been over the years. Please keep up and maintain the standards."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bzhEZmtRRRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,"This store is usually good but today was disappointing. Hope this is not the usual standard. The nuts/ikan bills tasted a little stale. Chicken wing batter is not like before (not sure if recipe changed). Sambal is still good Thank goodness. If only the egg doesn't have a ""MacDonald shape"" and fried more naturally .. Anyway always has been a good store to me so hope today is not the new standard going forward."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBbDVxcy13RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,A couple that certainly takes pride in what they serve. Not just the food but respect for the customers. Greeting seniors respectfully ... keep it up.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNmJ2X3F3RRAB,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,This Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang is delicious with it spicy gravy and they have a lots of variety to choose.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMU1yN09nEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"It's rare to find good food with good service here in Singapore.This stall is one of the rare gems.

On service,the staff was very patient in explaining to me the differences between the 3 types of grilled chicken,and took the trouble to double confirm my orders.

Speaking of food quality,this is so far the best grilled chicken I had in Singapore.The outside is a bit charred and crispy,while the inside is tender and juicy.When you try to extract the flesh,it comes off easily.Only priced at $4.50 (for chicken only),which is very reasonable,considering the effort put in and the quality.

The Nasi Lemak was full of coconut flavor.Not the typical type you find here,which only has a hint of coconut flavor.It is comparable to Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak,which in my opinion is one of the best in Singapore.

It was well worth my effort travelling up all the way just to try it.But what really attracted me to give the stall a try was the owner's sincere gesture in handling the complaint made by a customer.

We usually see owners or customer service officers responding with an apology,which is all.But this stall owner was willing to offer the customer a free meal,I think action speaks louder than words and I applaud such an act.

One final point: I don't take egg.I told the staff that I wanted my set without egg,and she immediately told me that I could change the egg to something else.I was impressed.

Most of the time,if I said I didn't want something,that was it,no replacement,and the amount of food given is the same,price is also the same.I would say this stall is very ethical in its business operation.Thumbs up and may your business prosper."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJZzRiSkd3EAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,Not too spicy. Chicken wing is nice. Rice serving a little small though.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5M183NGZREAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,2,"Rice was fragrant. But the grilled chicken was disappointing, its was tasteless and mushy (totally different from tender). Its like lifeless meat. Chilli wasnt what i expected too, there is a weird taste lingering in the mouth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaWNuZVJREAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,5,"Ordered 22 boxes of nasi lemak Ayam taliwang (their signature rice) for a small party on quite a last minute notice. But Noorman was really prompt in attending to some of our special requests and offered some discounts here and there. The food came promptly at the time we wanted and the food is still piping hot, same standard as when we ate it at the stall itself. All our guests were impressed with the food quality. Will definitely consider ordering again if we have any gatherings. Thanks once again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzakx5SEtnEAE,Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang - Yishun Park Hawker Centre,3,"A very solid 3. Had their signature set K. But I think my chicken was alittle over-charred and there was a burnt taste to it. Even if I take that out of account, I felt the Nasi (rice) could be better and more fragrant. It's alittle starchy. The peanut to ikan ratio was also disappointing. But the chili is great. Overall if u happen to be here and have that Nasi Lemak or Indonesian BBQ craving, this would certainly satisfy u. But I think they can still improve. I will give it another try some time again. 👍"

Signals that their hygiene level is not up to standard! Will not patronise again, unfortunately.

===========

Very unassuming place, in an industrial building.

Pleasantly surprised by the food. The curry is really thick and flavourful. The curry chee cheong fun was amazing. The plain CCF with spring onion was decent too.

Curry mee was nice with a lot of ingredients. Ipoh curry hor fun was nice too, quite different in flavour.

Overall great, just wish it wasn't so oily. The food is pretty ""sinful"", won't eat so often but will be back."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1by1XRW1nRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"We have been frequent this small eatery since yrs ago. One can never misse the Curry Chee Cheong Fun, either topped with shredded chicken or pig skin. The pig skin curry  is unique as we do not really get it easily here. It was deep fried then stewed with curry sauce which turned it soft yet retained the chewy texture. Curry sauce is really thick and aromatic. The CCF was tender, when soaked in curry sauce, one just cannot stop eating it until finished. The thin Hor Fun Noodle Soup has clear soup, mild chicken soup taste,  suitable for young kids who cannot take spicy food. Nasi Lemak is ok only, not really fantastic, the sambal is more on sweet side. Asam laksa is not really sour after sweetened. Broth is not very thick,  taste average. Curry Mee has the most generous portion with pig skin,  boneless chicken thigh pieces, tau pok and sliced fish cake. I changed yellow noodle to vermicelli which absorb the curry sauce more. This bowl of noodle is very satisfying and value for money. Coffee is not really nice if compared to the one we had in Ipoh."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bkxPYzBBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Hidden within the industrial estate, an Ipoh eatery that serves very nice Malaysian food. Various style of Chee Chiong Fun not the type you find in hawker. Like the CCF mushroom & meat, nasi lemak, Rojak (with added crackers), and curry noodles."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTZDckt3EAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,The food is fresh and taste good. Environment is clean and tidy. The table setting makes me feel a little congested where I could easily hit the people sitting behind me. The price is a little high given the type of food they provide. Overall a good experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnVuSmNBEAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"My dear Malaysian friend recommended this place for authentic Ipoh food. Price is very reasonable. Similar to foodcourt or kopitiam price. Their signature cheecheongfun is a must try. Very 👍 Curry noodle is 😋 too. The spring onion cheecheongfun taste ordinary, can skip that"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeFpHMkpREAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Is been a year didn’t came back here breakfast.
I rmr my previous experience was the place are super crowded, waiting time too long.

Today went for early breakfast.
Surprisingly the the food taste better then last time 🤣 good !

Overall their foods is good, price wise slightly higher (if compare normal hawker), but they are aircon & nice deco environment so consider reasonable.

Recommend the Ipoh kopi , not so sweet n the taste jz nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdW95TU53EAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Found this place by chance and the reviews on their Curry Chu Cheong Fan with pork skin. IN LOVEEEEEE. Asam laksa was alright and chicken chop was the saving grace of the nasi lemak. Had ice coffee but was quite tastless.. Nevertheless, will deft be back for the curry ccf!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeHVPelBREAE,Anson Town Bistro,3,Average food. Better to travel to Teluk Intan for the original. There is nothing special about the mee. The Assam laksa is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXVxRHhBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,5,Very decent Malaysian food can be found here. Yam cake & chee Cheong fun were really good. Nasi lemak was big in portion and allso came with vegetables 👍 clean interior and plenty seats. Probably the only downside is that it is less accessible for those not driving.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdVlqRkJ3EAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,I am not sure if this is authentic or not cause I never tried the original one before. However I do like the foods here and enjoyable. The Nasi lemak chicken cutlet and the curry taste are really nice. The Anson special zhu Chiong fan also nice and something special compare to other Chiong fan out there. The seats are limited. Come early if you don’t wish to wait too long. Enjoy~
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaU5iV2hRRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Chong fan yummy. Curry mee was great except the chicken meat (got a ""frozen"" smell which was not so nice when consumed)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNUtfVGtBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,5,"Introduced by a Malaysian bestie and claimed as the authentic Malaysian taste 😂😂
The Curry Pig Skin Chee Cheong Fun is recommended.

Should try the Dry Mee with Char Siew too, the sauce used is different from most of culinaries here.

Be prepared that it is crowded on weekend morning, decided to go for takeaway on 2nd visit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcWJiakZnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Fantastic curry! I had the dried curry and soup, its about 80% close to what I can get in Ipoh! Had the nasi lemak and the anson special chee cheong fun, it was okay, nothing crazy good about it. The white coffee is good though, its creamy yet not too sweet. Love it! Overall, I quite like it!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHa29MdXNBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,3,Curry noodles was nice. Chock full of ingredients. Special CCF is interesting though chye poh was all I could taste. Their CCF texture is probably the softest around even compared to HK style. But this is Ipoh style. So they don’t do char siew or prawn. And that is a real pity.

We tried few dishes of G Cheong Fun, pig skin curry G Cheong Fun, Signature G Cheong Fun & Dry Chicken Curry Hor Fun..the G Cheong Fun is OK, the Dry Curry was great, love it 🥰🥰 as for pig skin curry, the pig skin was great as for the curry, i think the coconut milk was a bit too thick. 🤤🤤 the Signature dish was yummy 😘😘😘 the rojak with crackers are superb 😘😘🥰🥰 heong piah was great (served warm)..coffee so-so..overall experienced is Great 🥰🥰🥰"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtc2ZmQXB3RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Tried the pumpkin n yam kueh n nasi lemak, quite good. But best of all,  do the chee cheong fun,  best!  Will b back...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdGJYWlVREAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"It's cheap, have nice decor n aircon. Yam cake is good enough. Laksa n special chee cheong fun is not so good, try ordering other stuff. Can improve by tidying n decor the place better. Service can be faster. Prices should be clearly stated. Go during off peak to find a seat. I will still give 5 star because it's cheap n unique place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLN01DY1R3EAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"Food is nice with reasonable price, GST inclusive. Authentic Malaysian Food. Like their curry Chu Cheong Fun and Char Siew in the dry noodles. The Char Siew just tasted like those I had in Malaysia. Yam cake is good too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPa2VUZ0pBEAE,Anson Town Bistro,1,"Today went over this place for lunch but we do not have a menu to look at and make our order. The staff told us only one menu is available and it was place at the ordering counter. When we are looking at the menu, the queue started and the staff told us to put the menu back for those who are in queue to place order. Later the staff told us to scan the QR code to place our order. I just wondering if old people doesn't know how to use phone to scan QR code to place order then no need to order. Besides how can such a eatery just print one miserable menu. Perhaps they just want to cater to young patrons. Furthermore the auntie taking the order also very bad attitude as though we own her money. Their food taste wasn't to my liking. For sure this will be the first n last time patron this eatery."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN182a1NREAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,My favourite restaurant for Assam laksa and Anson Chee CheongFun
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMTc2MnlBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,2,"Recommend by friend. 1st tried. As Malaysian I think these was far from Authentic. But if crave it, don’t aspect too high. I think “Malaysia Boleh” laksa better then this and Ipoh curry mee yishun Industrial Street was nice than here. But the environment here was pretty good and the Ipoh white coffee is nice."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aHZXcUxBEAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,Found Malaysia delicacies I would recommend. I like the curry with pork skin! Serve with the ice coffee it’s the best match. Yummy!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c09HVW93RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,5,Delicious Ipoh food. The curry mee was super delicious. Thick and flavorful. The assam laksa was authentic too! The ice white coffee was thick and good. Anson special chee cheong fun was special. It was full house at 6.30 pm on a Sunday. Ample parking space outside the cafe. Bought some Ipoh snacks to try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMThmTTJnRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Went over for a weekday lunch. Not crowded. Price is reasonable for an aircon place although it's in an industrial area. I found the chee cheong fun over-rated and mine was served cold. It has a nice fragrance from the taste of shallots and that's it. We saw they were busy so didn't feedback. Not sure if it is better on other times as feedback from others here were good.
We enjoyed the curry chicken and assam noodles although it's a little watery. Nice coffee and tea. Will return to try the yam cake, porridge and nasi lemak."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMmY3bjlBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,Authentic Anson fare. Love their Curry Pig Skin and Anson Special. More mint leaves might help enhance the flavours for their Penang Laksa. Overall a wonderful dining experience with very authentic Malaysian fare.  😊👍🏻
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxME9mVnVnRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,3,"Tried the curry pig skin ccf. As a Ipoh Kia myself, the ccf is indeed very smooth and soft in texture , one the few best. But the curry is not thick enough and lack of flavour , also can't taste curry flavour from the pig skin (by right the pig skin itself should be flavourful enough). The long bean also a bit hard and raw. Can try if you are nearby but don't set your expectation too high"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLWNQNl9BRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"I sum up this place as a watering hole for ppl who miss KL food. Definitely can't beat the famous, authentic but hard to find KL Pasar Pudu wet market curry chee cheong fun. Ingredient-wise, Anson Town is a little more like Ipoh style with pig skin, long beans and thicker curry sauce (KL one has fu-zok, fragrant haebee & lots of sesame seed). I quite like their baked kaya kok (triangulated puff pastry with kaya filling) - not cheap but this is S'pore what. A must try for first-timers"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjVXbjd3RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Highly recommended!
Went on 24/09/2022, the Chicken curry Chee Cheong Fun is very nice, tasty curry gravy, the rojak is very delicious, also recommend curry me, tasty curry gravy and it's very big portion & many ingredients. Also recommend Ipoh Coffee."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMHVEeEhnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"Delicious food at reasonable price and  in cosy cafe.  Loved the curry noodles here, tasted like the ones i had in JB. The chee cheong fun is worth mentioning as well, silking warm rice rolls with i think is fried onions which is very flavorful. The nasi lemak is not as good but worth a try. Ample parking lots situated right infront of the cafe. Will be back to try more of other chee cheong fun flavors and definitely the curry noodles again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cVBQVkpBEAE,Anson Town Bistro,3,"This ""ulu"" bistro was packed on a weekday lunch. Lovers of Malaysian-style chee cheong fun and curry noodles would like the menu here. Unfortunately, I find the food a bit disappointing. I ordered 3 types of ccf, 1 nasi lemak and 1 curry noodles. The tastes were generally bland. Maybe I am used to the more flavourful ""San Cheng"" Malaysian noodles which can be found in many shopping centres. The kaya puffs looked promising but the kaya and the pastry were not fragrant. They had draft beer and fried bar snacks here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLLXNlbmZREAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"The taste of the Chee Cheong Fun is delicious, soft, and smooth. It surprised me when I took the first bite. But the taste of the pigskin is so so..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDODlucW5RRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,1,"Authentic Ipoh style cuisine. Easy on the pocket.

Review revised on 11 Nov 20.

Now the business here has improved dramatically but service quality went the opposite direction.

The first batch of the staff were from Malaysia. They were humble and very attentive. All left now, possibly due to covid.

The current workers are from China and Vietnam. They have one thing in common: very rude. Especially the China national, just need to sit in here for 5 minutes, you can hear her yelling at customers telling them to collect the food, order verification etc. She even told customers that :""last time no customers, now I am very busy.""

The only good service you will receive is from the bosses who appear usually on Sunday.

I hope that they can hire locals or possibly pay more to the staff so that there might be a small chance they would behave better."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpX1pYbl9BRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,3,"Cheong fan texture is nice but too dry, curry is thick but the spice taste is too strong like hindu curry. 純屬個人口味"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVOEl1SVZREAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"Great tasting Teluk Intan food. Have not been there so can't compare but food is value for money at the quality served. Great chillax ambience too, complimented by soothing Chinese MTV. Liked the pan fried chee cheong fan, dry curry noodle, chicken chop nasi lemak, great coffee and the oh so good bean curd."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpemNPeTRBRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Dine in today and the food taste much better than takeaway. Their Chee Cheong Fun is the signature dish, you can have it many ways, dry, soy sauce, curry, plain and many more. The rice roll is soft and taste better either way. I think that makes their speciality as their Hor Fun also have the same texture. Their noodles also not bad. Although prices are slightly higher than food court, but I think their speciality makes them worth a try if you craving for Malaysian tasted food and dining ambience Is very comfortable with aircon. Last but not least, their Ipoh coffee is thick and creamy too."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dnRxWGFnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Happened to be in Sembawang running errands. Did an online search where to have lunch and Anson Town Bistro popped up. The place was packed on a weekend afternoon when we swung by. Ordered: Pig skin curry chee cheong fun, curry noodles, chicken chop nasi lemak. Must say they serve decent Malaysian-style food. Do try when you're in the area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdk56NjVnRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"If you are the someone who misses Malaysian delicasies, Anson Town can satisfy your gourmet cravings especially the cheong fun serve in curry gravy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb05tdDJ3RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,3,"Went there last Sunday but it was super crowded and it didn't look like there was a system to manage the crowd. There were people standing around the tables to wait/chope the tables. There were people queuing to order the food. You wouldn't know what to do, whether to find a table first or to queue and place order at the cashier. Just very messy. We immediately left the place and the group behind us pretty well did the same.

Went there again ytd, a Friday afternoon. Around 2pm plus which was already after lunchtime. Only a few tables were occupied but there were at least 3 to 4 tables with crockery uncleared. There was only one uncle trying to clear all the dirty tables and the used crockery after being cleared was placed beside the self service station for the clean crockery. The hygiene level, IMHO, was totally not there. The menu at the cashier was also stained w gravy and they didn't even bother to wipe it.

We ordered curry chicken noodles, assam laksa, two fried chicken. Assam laksa was quite good, the flavour was there and as close as those I had in JB. Curry noodles on the other hand was lacklustre, and the chicken pieces were probably 4 thin slices. The fried chicken was my least favourite, one dimension flavour tho it was served hot."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLZzhEa0RnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,"The location is quite secluded. However, the price would make up for it. Comfort food for those who miss the hometown."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4bWNfLXd3RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,5,"Cosy environment. They do sell beers at night. If you prefer quiet place with some decent foods, this could be your choice. They are located at industrial area."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcl9lUDhRRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Nice place. Tried Fried chicken chop Nasi Lemak $5. Taste so so. Rice not so fragrance. Tried Dry Mee $4. Taste also so so. Curry chicken cheong fun $4.50 is good, curry is great! This I will recommend to try. Coffee also not bad."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDX0tUdWNREAE,Anson Town Bistro,5,Nice food 👍🏻 The service is good. Small cozy traditional cafe located within an industrial building.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdXRIZUdnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,3,"cheong fun is too dry. Asam laksa & nasi lemak are okay. Rojak is nice.
But this outlet is quite far from bus stops which is 10mins walking distance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRbTctWGlnRRAB,Anson Town Bistro,3,"Tried penang laksa, ipoh hor fun and anson special chee cheong fun. Laksa taste ok lack of prawn paste. Chee cheong fun is not up to my expectation as uts kind of bland and dry. The hor fun taste normal. Like the home made soya bean milk, quite tasty and not too sweet."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMjVpQnp3RRAB,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Food is okay but not great, not worth to travel the extra mile for. Curry mee is overrated."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOHByQkhREAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"I have never tried the food in Anson before. But the food in this restaurant had unique food that aren't commonly found in Singapore.

They also bake their pastries fresh everyday. My family loves the traditional pastries.

Rojak with crispy cracker taste good, but because they use a bowl, all the rojak sauce sank to the bottom and it turned out super salty.

The rest of the food were great, I love the Anson Special chee cheong fun, very silky and smooth. Will definitely try other flavour next time.

Overall, nice ambience and great food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlM2J1UFRREAE,Anson Town Bistro,3,"The soup ipoh hor fun was quite good, but everything else was just average. They close quite early at 8pm as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aXJXMUVBEAE,Anson Town Bistro,3,"It is too crowded during weekend lunch and long queue. Food is just average. Only nasi lemak and chicken wing/cutlet is recommended. The rest are really average i.e. curry noodles, rojak.  Not really worth the queue. The Anson Chu Chang Fen is disappointing... the heung piah and daosa piah worth try as it is fresh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdVlqa1FnEAE,Anson Town Bistro,4,"Staff are very friendly. I like the asam laksa noodle soup, the soup are very thick and the curry noodle are tasty. Highly recommend to those missing malaysian food people 🤤😁."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaDRuRlBBEAE,Al Kautsar,5,"Mee soto and mee rebus - some of the best I've had in SG. They're not heavy on the palette after eating and ingredients are fresh. Don't forget the bergadil, epok epok (kentang❤️) and fried tempeh which are all tasty as well.

Stallholders are lovely too. You can tell they take pride in the food they sell.

(Sorry I didn't take any photo the last few times I had the food from here cos couldn't wait lol)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcU5IcEh3EAE,Al Kautsar,5,"Stall owner is friendly & accommodating to order request
Loves the Longtong as it's fresh cabbage and ingredients well cooked with lemak definitely a go for dish
Briyani with long grain rice with spicy Chicken curry just appetizing with extra curry and papadan, a filling meal indeed. But must note that this is different from Indian Briyani

Will go back for more and update with Photos of dishes 😉"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdGRXZGNREAE,Al Kautsar,5,Tried their Mee rebus and lontong. Both really good. To be honest I felt it was better than all the other stalls opened in the morning in this coffeeshop.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5LU4zOE9REAE,Al Kautsar,5,"They offer delicious Malay food, the sambal chili is homemade by the boss."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWFudUR3EAE,Syed Restaurant,4,Only came here for prata and teh halia…shiok. Service does get very slow when they are busy so come during off peak. Egg prata price is now $2.00 🙀 halal neighborhood restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHFyMHFnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,1,Today I have mutton rice asked worker to put little extra piece. They charged $ 11.50 price. Which is ridiculous for the meal. They gave only curry apart one vegetable which is smelly and useless appalam. I mean not puffy. When I asked why are you charging this much simple answer for the extra piece. Day light robbery. When I asked for the break up they literally showing finger. Just pay or keep the food you ate.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aU9hRlVnEAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"Workers atitude is so horrible! I wanted to order Prata Tissue and they rejected my request as they told me they were busy with so many customers orders. And can't even make 1 piece of prata tissue 🙄 then after 15 mins sitting at the table while my family's food finished, I tried my luck again to order Prata Tissue as most of the customers has  leave the makan place, they accepted my order. How pathetic that is. And im complaining about prata tissue overall. Hahahaha"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNk9paFlBEAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"I'm not sure is the workers' attitude or lack of ingredients .. We were there to get our supper last night. Ordered mee goreng.. Maggi goreng.. Fried rice.. Sup kambing and nasi briyani. Mee goreng had nothing in it.. Just plain noodles with dark soya sauce.. Not even a stripe of beansprouts or vege..not even with sambal.. N yet tasteless at all.. We all were very very surprised n dissatisfaction with the food. Eat halfway n end up in dustbin chute. Haven't mentioned that each of the food was priced at 5-6 each. Sorry to say even hawkers economic noodles looks n taste better. Sup kambing was just spiced with water, only 4pieces of small cut of meat in the Sup..n not to mention was full of grease. Chicken Briyani rice just don't feel like it..to cut the bad time short.. Too harsh to say.. We hope you may cheat us that night... But hope that others will take note. That's our first and last. Next time we definitely go for McD. Thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldzhLSnNnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,Another delicious Indian Muslim foods restaurant. Just only seating capacity limited to 30 to 40 pax only. Parking space No problem
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXA3NFZREAE,Syed Restaurant,1,Ordered masala thosai and one of its gravy was totally bland zero taste. After making payment told the guy at counter about it and his answer was that’s how it is supposed to taste like. Wow. Ego too big i guess. Anyway other food I order wasn’t nice too actually. Nasi goreng kerabu taste more like rice with white pepper. Good luck to those trying 😎
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOHNyQTBRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,"I had ordered a Mee Goreng last, last night. We waited and waited. We saw them serving other customers first. (we were regular customers in the day, so they probably did not recognize us) After 45 min, a customer said that is too long and left. So, we decided to go also. But before we told them we are gonna leave, we asked them if they are going to give us the food. All of the workers in the restaurant were very responsible except one person. He is the person at ordering station. After we had asked him, he said that if you can't wait, then leave. We had waited for almost 1 hour.
The cook came and said that he already cooked a lot. That is when the reason for the problem came. The person who shouted at me actually served his regular customers. The cook knew us. He tried to calm me down and gave the food to us. We said thank you to the chef and left. So, only the person who was at the the ordering station was irresponsible. Now, you might know the reason why they serve your food very late. Thank you for taking your time to read this!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb3E2bHZnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,A little dirty but the food is hella good. The service is good too. Just the floor and tables looked oily. But I guess it's kinda normal? But anyway it's super good. Really recommend for eating at night. The atmosphere feels really warm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJMnA2OHNRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,They will test your patience. Even though it was not that busy on this Saturday night 10 pm they kept me waiting 15 minutes for my banana prata untill I finish my teh tareh..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHVHWHRRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Visit this shop early in the morning to meet up with friends. The place is not crowded. Alot of seats are available during my visit. The service is as expected in an Indian Muslim restaurant. They will accede to your request without hassle. The food we order in the morning are the obvious, which is Prata. The crowds start to build up after 8am. If meeting friends or just to fill up for breakfast, nothing fancy, this place will do."

Comes with cucumber"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anFTV1pREAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"My family and I was craving for prata. We ate few times but today’s experience was horrible. Upon reaching a table, there’s an ipad left on the table beside the table we are located. I partially open the cover of ipad and check if someone has left it, but I decided to move it away from our table and leave it. About 15mins later a Lady confronted us and say next time dont touch, ask around and thats how she reserved the table. She talked to us in a bad tone. We apologised and keep quiet. The mentioned lady was apparently working in the shop. After few minutes, a guy, who is working also in the shop, talked to us and said “what she said was right? Do you have something to say?” Then we defend ourselves. They embarrassed us in front of many people which is not a customer service. To the owner of this shop, may review the cctv and investigate on the incident. A belonging that is valuable shouldnt be left unattended. Such behaviour is unacceptable for customer service. A proper and mannerly approach should be considered. Hope you can take action on this."

ice water is now 50 cents a cup up from 30 cents before.

no more smoking area too.
so smokers take note."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MEltbUhREAE,Syed Restaurant,4,The food was good. Most the food in the menu was not available. Had to order 3 times before I go to eat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncDhXdjB3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,1,No quality and expensive.. $7 for a plate of so called “seafood” hor fun with only 1 not fresh small prawn and few pieces of sotong at a void deck Coffeeshop..  when we double check with the menu it was only written as $6 and they even argue because I ask for seafood? Hmmm... better watch it when you do decide to come here to eat..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvajRqMWdnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Excellent teh halia (tea with a ""kick"" - ginger water). The roti john (no human flesh here, just a nice toasted baguette with scrambled egg, roasted chicken chunks, tomato-barbeque sauce and mayonnaise!) was fantastic, the nasi goreng ikan bilis (fried rice with crunchy fried little fish) was fresh and hot! Will try other dishes next time..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a19IdDl3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,it's my one of the favourite restaurant food and drinks taste yummy amazing 👏 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOFktWXZBRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Nice food everytime. Over the years their service improved, even though they are busy they still managed to serve us on time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNllXVFRBEAE,Syed Restaurant,4,A good Indian restaurant in neighbour around Yishun church. They sell South Indian Halal food. The restaurant is stretched over 4 shops in a raw selling a large verity of Indian food. Their Prata Bom (prata with cheese and condensed milk in it) tastes great. Will go again for sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVeDhldnd3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,Awesome Indian food. Great prata and curry (fish). Generally almost everything you order here is great-tasting especially from their Thai menu.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbTZhNTJRRRAB,Prata Wala,4,"Abit on the pricey side for a prata but the quality is undoubtedly one of the best that I've tasted. The curries are excellent and I would highly recommend the mutton curry, tender and yum 😋 tasty. I would go again when I want to pay that kind of price again for a great prata. 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPektLNkJBEAE,Prata Wala,4,"For 2 cup of tea and 4 prata (2 eggs and 2 plain prata)- $15 was on the high side.
Even if food inflation and the high rental had been incorporated inside, $15 was really expensive.
The saving grace, was the food was good. Nice prata. Including my ginger tea was nice.
Surprisingly, though I felt the prices were high, it was very crowded. Seemed the rest of the crowd were comfortable with the pricing."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPaklqZTB3RRAB,Prata Wala,5,"Reached the store at 9.30am and it was already crowded, about 60% of the seats were taken up. I ordered one egg and one plain prata, food was served in about 20 minutes, waiting times was abit long. Other than that, food was delicious and stall cleanliness was good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cDl6aEVnEAE,Prata Wala,5,"Had brunch at Prata Wala last Sunday.

Some food needs to be consumed almost immediately. Take for instance, roti prata.. Crispy prata and warm curry! 🤤 It's never disappointing for me even if I order grabfood.

So I had to jio my mom and sister to try out at least once. Indeed, we enjoyed our food that day.

Keep on doing your best and bring out the best food quality to us consumers. Thanks for the effort, appreciate much!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNy1tbWVREAE,Prata Wala,4,"I visited in lunch time. They don't serve ta doori meals then. I ordered Curry chicken briyani set, Butter chicken prata set and cheese prata. Butter chicken curry had aroma of charcoal roasted. Other curry sauces were all different taste. All of them  were yummy.
I would try tandoori meals at dinner time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb0pfbU1REAE,Prata Wala,5,"Amazing food! The whole experience from start to finish is great waiter is always so friendly and kind. Very tasty and well prepared and can choose among many menu options. Absolutely amazing place to eat, 10 of 10 for every single aspect of this meal, and this is coming from people who know and love great food! The staff ( Danes )  and greeter were very nice. Our waiter was awesome, the staff also worked as a team in bringing and cleaning up our food. Highly Recommend!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OVB1OEpnEAE,Prata Wala,5,"Super yummy Indian food ! Best Prata other than Prata house . Super affordable 👍🏼 Two pax - roughly $30 - their BEST butter chicken prata set, masala thosai, two teh iced"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc2ZueWZREAE,Prata Wala,4,The onion pratas were good and had lots of fresh onions inside. The only downside is the prata here are quite costly. Pratas were served fast - hot and crispy.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGEyQXJnRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"Always doesn’t disappoint! In terms of service, and food! Definitely will come back again. Thanks!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMV8tMWRnEAE,Prata Wala,5,The food  is exceptional! Very tasty and well prepared and you can chose among many menu options. I love the service at the place the staff Danes is so friendly with the guests and always takes care to offer the best quality! I highly recommend this place.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcU52S09nEAE,Prata Wala,3,"Service has improved tremendously! Manager and staff were very polite and helpful. This is a huge improvement from the previous team of staff. I’d rate the service 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

I can’t say the same for the food quality. The pratas were average, just soft and there’s zero crisps (not even on the outside). Plaster prata came with a fully cooked egg. Garlic nann was extremely tough as well. Teh was poorly made."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c19HNmNREAE,Prata Wala,2,Prata wala says #skipthestraw but they put the curry in a disposable paper container 🤦
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXBXOUx3EAE,Prata Wala,1,"Very rude staff service. The staff accidentally opened the door and knocked on my mum. Instead of making appologize, the staff told my mum should not use that path. If this was not a walkway, shouldn't you put a signboard there. Shouldn't you appologize as a basic manner?  I spoke the manager but the manager just pretended busy and did not take any remedial action for the rude behavoiur of his staff. Bad service n will not cime back again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbmE3UGxBRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"One of the best prata (and curry) I've ever had, as well as very good service from ordering to tray collection. This is my go-to place for prata and I hope no one realises how good Prata Wala is so I won't need to queue."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcFl5cU9BEAE,Prata Wala,4,"The curry chicken is good, poured gravy over the rice, making it very flavourful. Have not tried the part yet. Good service as the staff kept walking around asking if the food is ok."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NVlYbDN3RRAB,Prata Wala,5,"If u crave for soft-type prata, this is the place for you! The prata has its own unique sweet taste. But to me personally, I would come back for the teh tarik! It's balance between sweetness, milk, and tea was just right. The prata that I would recommend you to try would defo be the plain prata as you can really taste its raw unique sweetness. Give it a go!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ajlQbW1nRRAB,Prata Wala,4,"Pretty gd prata, curry watery but OK. First time coming here, a little ex."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cDg2ZUdnEAE,Prata Wala,5,Food was amazing! Awesome briyani! Naveed delivered customer service very well. Will definitely come again!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleElDMUJBEAE,Prata Wala,5,One of my go-to places for Indian food. A hot cup of nice teh tarik and crispy prata made to order in this rainy day just…  🤤💯
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX19pSzNBRRAB,Prata Wala,5,Yummy Roti Prata and Fish Curry goes together so well. Set Briyani Rice not bad too. And milk tea so delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0pUbF9RRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"It’s a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing food and service. A staff by the name of danish i met there was extremely friendly,knowledgeable and make great hospitality during my dining. Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bEw2SnBRRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"Bought their set lunch for 19.90. ordered the chicken curry prata and butter chicken biryani, comes with 2 drinks too! Nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheHFPNHl3RRAB,Prata Wala,2,"I ordered 5 food via grab food. They delivered only 4 and the items also different. When I make a call to the manager, she said to collect from their restaurant. She refused to arrange the delivery. So rude"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOVluZ3lBRRAB,Prata Wala,1,"This is the second time in a row prata wala has got my order wrong. I ordered takeaway so I didn’t realize until I got home. Terrible, especially since I paid more than the food I got. One of the times they even gave me briyani when I ordered prata. The receipt is on the bag. But they just anyhow pack the food inside. Such a disappointment after waiting so long for the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzaHR1bHhBRRAB,Prata Wala,1,"It has been one of my worst experiences here in Singapore for my quest for good Indian food and Biryani. If you get a chance, do yourself a favour and get out. There are better options at B2 food court. Forget about the value for price but the quality of food is not supposed to be served at all. Chicken is very old that it is literally rubber now. Biryani is far below par taste and forget about the overpriced prata and teh!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMTl6c1R3EAE,Prata Wala,5,"Hi, I had a wonderful meal at North Point recently the food is really awesome will be bc again for the food n service, n the staff wearing a cap wit black long sleeve with his spec really oberservent ,he chk on our food drinks n gt our feed bc that's which is  really good practice even though it's prata wala. The whole team was really service oriented, cheers guys will c u soon tc.."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya0tzOBAB,Prata Wala,5,"Was brought to this restaurant by one friend who said that his family will always eat here when visiting at Singapore.

Their roti prata are made fresh to order and thus, what can go wrong with freshly made prata. The curry complemented the prata well. Not expensive at all considering the air con environment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyck1hMDBnRRAB,Prata Wala,5,Had a wonderful dinner tonight. Although it's a bz day but the guy named Danes served me well n patiently took my order. Kudos to the team.❤️
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaUtiSGJREAE,Prata Wala,5,"Good food, fast service and convenient location."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M01XZ2NBEAE,Prata Wala,4,Curry fish head was yummy and fresh but takes awhile to serve. Maybe can improve by cooking the vegetables longer too. 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX1BUOWpRRRAB,Prata Wala,1,"Food is decent but the service is ridiculously slow.

The customer is often left wondering at the cashier and waiting for the staff to eventually attend to you. Some give up and leave the queue in frustration.

The food preparation time is dismally slow despite the “fast food service” claim by the business. The result is the seating area where few seated diners are actually eating whilst the others are just waiting for their orders to arrive.

My drink order was served at 1042h (took 30 mins!?) and food finally arrived at 1050h (took 40 mins?!)

C’mon guys... get your act together."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb0xlNkpBEAE,Prata Wala,5,Had a wonderful dinner . Gud recommendation by the cashier girl and great service by the guy named Danes who served us. Food was soo good and delicious . The restaurant was soo clean and comfort to eat . Will b back again
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaU9XNmZnEAE,Prata Wala,5,Decent to good standard Indian food. Slightly on the pricier side.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNFc3ViWXhBRRAB,Prata Wala,3,The food is good. But the service is not good. If there any delay in serving food then they should inform earlier while placing the order rather than keep us waiting for 45mins. All are busy in packing the food for online orders only.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMll5TDBRRRAB,Prata Wala,1,"i feel so shock when i reach home and open up the box, portion is so little and also i ask the guy packing the last piece of chicken is the chicken hot and he mention  ""yes hot hot"" and he pack inside the plastic bag and turns out chicken is so cold just like it have been left in the food tray for few hour."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNWYycm5BRRAB,Prata Wala,1,We had a very bad experience today with prata wala. Worst service. Too much waiting time. Food quality was average only. Please make sure the availability of food  before taking order.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeDVDWjRRRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"The egg prata is crispy and soft. Fish curry also delicious and pair with teh tarik, awesome. Staff friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdWNQd0JBEAE,Prata Wala,4,"Plain prata is nicely crisp. Kopi is special. Waiting time is abit long. Just go in and sit, no need to queue (the queue is for takeaway)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPLWVEanJnRRAB,Prata Wala,5,Friendly staff and amazing food! The place was also clean and hygienic! Will definitely be back again! (:
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcDgtenFBRRAB,Prata Wala,1,Today I ordered Tandoori Chicken from this restaurant. I got it packed and when I opened the box there were just 2 small pieces of tandoori chicken. Sad part is this is not at all worth for its price ( 7.60SGD).   This is very expensive and tasteless. If you wana try tandoori chicken please skip this place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1akpLTDJRRRAB,Prata Wala,4,Reliable consistent local curry and biryani fare served in generous portions - will never be disappointed
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNDhMTFZ3EAE,Prata Wala,5,Enjoyed the plain dosai. Crispy yet soft. Also bought butter chicken. Quite generous serving.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURFZ3JPRXVnRRAB,Prata Wala,4,"$1.50 per kosong prata. Elsewhere could be cheaper. But the clean environment and one of the nicest prata we have eaten so far deserve the high price.
The curry serving is enough for 2 pratas. We feel more is needed if order more than 2."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbU0yeXZBRRAB,Prata Wala,5,"Excellent restraunt.😊We can get North Indian food here. Such as chicken tikka, biriyani rice , prata and others .Their chikken tikka taste really awesome. I personally recommend it. If you loves North Indian food can go for this without any doubt .Excellent and authentic north Indian food.Lunch time will be crowded. Most reasonably priced. Staff and Manager Naveed are more than willing to go the extra mile for customer satisfaction.Great teamwork also ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXcU1PN0R3EAE,Prata Wala,1,"Shocking customer experience and mediocre food.
Should have check out the reviews first instead of just walking in. Will give 0 star if I could.
Went there with my son because he thought the prata looks good but boy, were we in for a nasty surprise!
Staff came over and shouted at him saying he was eating too slow and other people are waiting for the table.
There was only two people queuing, that might be eating in or taking away. But there was a few other tables that are empty.
Regardless, we did not just order one drink and sit there chatting. He just a young child and to be shouted at with these remarks is really appalling.
The reviews on customer service and quality shows a very clear indication that something needs to be done with training and managing of the quality otherwise prata wala will soon be PRATA WAN DAN soon!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dHByRzZnRRAB,Prata Wala,4,"This outlet is at the old North wing, near Cold storage. We had the tandoori set for two and used an eatigo discount for 20% at 6.30pm (only at Northpoint outlet) $25.60 for two of us plus two teh tarik. Impatient diners must note it does take some time for tandoori. It was a very good deal because the set was huge and most importantly, the quality was good. Chicken was well flavoured and tender. You queue, pay and collect your drinks. The buzzer system is a little odd. They ring you once but it is actually for the drinks which you have already collected. The second buzzer is the one which would indicate your food is ready. Good service at this outlet. Having said that, I am quite a patient and forgiving person."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMVBidUlBEAE,Prata Wala,2,Ordered curry chicken bryani for takeaway.  The curry chicken was tough and bland. Not sure if they had used frozen chicken meat. Will think twice before buying again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMUlxb2l3RRAB,Prata Wala,4,"One of the renowned and authentic prata houses. Prices of food served are slightly on the high side but  make up with the quality of food. The restaurant, though, needs to improve in terms of its furniture and overall cleanliness."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNDhuUTB3RRAB,Prata Wala,2,"Small, cold and non crispy Fried chicken.

The star here is their curry sauce and Rice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM1A2WDlBRRAB,Prata Wala,5,The food was awesome.My fav was there chicken curry with parata *must try* . The staff over there really very kind and fast service.Wl recomend to other friend and visot soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydXNDS0h3EAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Good food. Nice service. Poori was a little thick. Otherwise food was good. Service by the male staff was very good. The lady also was all smiles and good. They can make it better by simply cleaning tables and chairs well and sweeping the floor now and then. The washbasin can be kept cleaner too by running water now and then. Hope they don't loose their Indian cook and service staff. Both are awesome or have to get local Singaporean Indian shop soggy Thosai and bad service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ29lYkp3EAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,"I always enjoyed Indian food.  The chapatti is nice and the gravy is generous.  The chapatti is rather small but they have 4 pcs. Still,  I had bigger chapatti at about the same price they charge.
Will return to try other goodies though."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldm9DdE1REAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Komala’s is one of the most excellent Indian food restaurants in Singapore. To try vegetarian Indian food, you must visit Komala’s! Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bzgtb2lnRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"I’ve visited quite often here because of few reasons those closed to me, always satisfied with food quality n taste, and quickly serve the order.

Parotta and kurma best options, however, not a big fan of samosa as I don't like curry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdDZEWGd3RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"A nice Indian vegetarian cuisine. A good place in Yishun to have scrumptious meal and snacks. The quality is pretty good and value for meal. Good hygiene but tad small. I had Vegetarian meals, vadai and bhatura chana in various instances. The taste was consistent and flavourful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OGNENnZnRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,1,I ordered 4 meals through grabfood for breakfast. 1 meal wasn't delivered. maybe the shop missed an order due to high order volume.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNcUpPbkpREAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,"Loved this place which is located right beside GV Yishun and Murugan grocery store. They have a huge variety of options available and the taste and quality of food is also very good.
And it’s a vegetarian only restaurant. Here’s what we ordered and how we felt:

Masala Dosa meal - comes with Masala dosa, 1 idli, 1 vada and a choice of drink - 4/5
Pav Bhaji - 4/5
Chole Batura - 4/5
Samosa chat - 4/5
Bru coffee - 5/5
Badam milk - 3/5
Lime juice - 3/5
Plain dosa - 5/5"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbjVTNFpREAE,Komala's Restaurants,3,Food is tasty but the side dish for dosa idly pongal not enough.they are giving very less.eventhough they will provide again.but we need to see the server face to ask our needs.cofee was not tasty.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX3V1QWVnEAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Was disappointed at first with the small space when we walked into the restaurant. We ordered Masala Dosai meal and South Indian Meal. Both sets came with tea. We had teh tarik and masala tea. The food is very good and so is the tea. We enjoyed our meal very much. The attending staffs were very courteous and helpful. The overall experience was very pleasant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbmVuR2VREAE,Komala's Restaurants,1,ordered food thru foodpanda.. sgd 15+ for thosa meal including delivery charge.. received food : only thosa + 1 idly!!!.. 1x vadai + 1x drink missing !!! and no notfication from komala's team.. contacted foodpanda team. very helpful. they manage the situation well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldzlhalFBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,Good south Indian food
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydU1PTG53RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,1,"Food has dropped the standard, service very bad. At times they even bother if u call them, plastic spoon given to wat puri. Not sure ,how their thought process on intake of food, one of the aunty sound quite rude, when I asked for spoon, then my drink was not served yet till I finished 1 puri. Disappointed!!! No more going there 😀"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1XzZ2VjVRRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,Best vegetarian restaurant in this area
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaDhieEhREAE,Komala's Restaurants,3,Lady staff is very rude. Lady staff is behaving very rude when we ask a baby chair for my 6 month baby. Male staffs are nice and food also good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzMXNHMFlREAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Great food & good service. Not too oily and love their not too sweet tea too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNDQyeWpnRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,Great authentic food and reasonable prices. Would be nice if they used less plastic...

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpZ0tYeGhBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,The food is delicious and prices are affordable. I am very glad that there is this restaurant near my place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbi1LUTlBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Best thosai I've had in a long while. Fast, fresh, and the sauces are really tasty too. However it can be a tad less salty.

Cleanliness can also be improved, there were leftover stains on the table where we sat. and air con was too cold"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDei1hVG93RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,Food is awesome. Friendly staff. Downside is just small and limited  seating area. Cleanliness is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOWIyNjZBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,4,Delicious food...nice friendly staff...just tat the outlet is abit too small... overall very good

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWV2T3BBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,4,"The vegetarian food served here is great. Besides food, I like their Masala tea and coffee. In addition to food and drinks, the customer service is good as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaXNMcGRREAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,Reasonable prices for food taste. I love it.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbi03dHh3RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,2,"This place is small and cramped. Expect some waiting time if you're planning to dine in here. This more like take-away food cart.

The first step into the restaurant nobody was assisting us to be seated. One of the male staff can be seen just standing and looking around, barely moving. Next we placed our order and it was fast serving for the main items, but the drinks and some small side orders not to be seen. We had to ask twice for it to be served.

The food was OK OK only, not so amazing, but the pricing was more towards the expensive side compared to any other Indian restaurants."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NFkyVjd3RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,1,Toooooo pricey for the menu. Not worth it
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdWYzV2d3RRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,Good vegetarian food. Good service.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbEtySnpBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,1,Very rude matured lady staff who told my pregnant wife who was carrying my 1 year old son to leave the restaurant and wait outside in the hot weather to collect the food. The thing is the restaurant only had 1 table filled and no else was standing in queue or waiting for food. Heartless lady. Food has also dropped standards as compared to little india or tanjong pagar outlet. They missed 2 items in my 6 items order and i dont live nearby to come back. No proper area to check the order also.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpcUtQcldREAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,"Good food but much smaller portions compared to the restaurants in Little India. Had the masala thosai but tiny bit of potato only. The chutneys were great and the sambar was very tasty. Stuffy service from the manager but the waiters are friendly and polite.

What needs to change is the appalling use of plastic and disposables that so many local restaurants and cafes use; this cafe is no different."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydG8ySHRRRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,4,Food taste but need to wait for dinning
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX096ZlhREAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Next to the north point shopping mall. Breakfast and Lunch are good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMDlMYkl3EAE,Komala's Restaurants,1,"i used to be regular few years back. But now a days tried to avoid. Few simple reasons, lunch is ridiculously priced 9.7$ and other items also price they have increased. They are using very small containers,  which is not enough for any one .. less sambar, curries, and dahi etc. Comparatively simillar resturants  give better quantity and quality food.
. but the price is high.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNlk3S1lBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,Authentic veg restaurant. Good family restaurant. I suggest this restaurant for indian breakfast recipes
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeGFlcm5nRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Great food at good deals! Worth having the Samosa with the Mint Chutney! Pair it with Badam Milk, Rose Milk or a hot cuppa tea for the perfect tea time snack!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxaXRpYUtBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,Although expensive but the food is tasty. I like their idly & chutney.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNXNtcnNBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Yummy... I love the set food... so good. Then finish off with hot coffee...
I had a good time with my family.
The place was clean.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMzgyUlJBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Love the authentic flavours of Indian vegetarian delights. The set meal makes for a pretty hearty meal leaving me satisfied and wanting to come back to sample the other palatable-looking selections.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTX3RmNkxnEAE,Komala's Restaurants,1,"Once you know ppl are going to come to you no matter what, you become god.

Went in ordered Masala Puri, it was rotten and smelly and my wife across the table could make out that it was spoiled.

Informed the staff its rotten.
They took the plates no apologies .

Asked what do you want in return said poori plate. Oh that's 7$ do you want pay extra.

Dude you give me a rotten food in the first place and expect me to pay as well.
Said i dont want poori meal but just poori, i guess it was less than masala poori but didnt ask for refund.
Just had and left.

I want something veg would rather go to Green Dot or prepare myself Maggi rather than visiting here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNXVEOHZRRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,Very good vegetarian restaurant.The food is taste good and have variety of choices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OElyZGRBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Expensive but good food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dXN1dXNBRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore!!  Good quality food with the same Indian taste!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaDYzSFdREAE,Komala's Restaurants,1,Very poor delivery service. Lunch order opening time late. Only at 11.30am.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeE4tc2N3EAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Small outlet extended from nearby kopitiam food court, easily accessible and serves decent Indian vegetarian dishes from both north and south Indian varieties"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtZ19LOWhnRRAB,Komala's Restaurants,5,"Simply best.
Must try the channa bhatura😋
Good choice for Vegetarians"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhd3Y3WVp3EAE,Komala's Restaurants,4,Good place to take away indian food. Food is reasonable in quality and price
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhOWJxQ0pBEAE,Komala's Restaurants,5,I felt the good hospitality of Mr Mahendran and Mdm Meena. And excellent customer service staff's. They served their customer with courtesy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtN3VhNGR3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"The lunch specials are quite a fair deal. The chicken in the biryani was good, although the rice wasn’t as fragrant or flavourful as it could be. The Prata Them All set was a hefty portion, as was the mini Ultimate Murtabak (can’t imagine what the regular size would be!). All considerably tasty and good value.

However, what I recommend is the plain prata—crispy and delicious without being overly oily. Sometimes simplest is best. I accompanied it with curry mutton and seasonal vegetables from the à la carte menu, though I would try something else, as the mutton was chewy and the vegetables (eggplant) absorbed too much oil. Regardless, flavours were palatable.

I had my first ever teh tarik, which was aromatic and sweetened just the right amount. Overall, a satisfactory meal. I’m glad to have found some good prata nearby. Next time, we will have to order conservatively because the food was heavy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbXA2RzhnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Really like their prata!

We used safra voucher deal as now having promotion-

1 set prata plus teh tarik only 50 cents! (Valid for the month of June 2022) .

On top of that we also ordered a chicken murtabak. Their murtabak is thin , didn't really have real chicken ingredients (too hungry so didn't manage to snap a photo). Hence I still prefer their prata 😆

I saw my next table having Maggie goreng and cheese prata (like very nice) shall order these items in my next visit.

Staffs have great services and are patience too. Thank you!

Will definitely be back"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPek5hTGpRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Pratas were served crispy but for some pratas there was something off about the texture - like it had been reheated / refried. Curry was nice but abit diluted compared to another branch that I visit, so it isn’t as shiok.
Teh tarik is really nice here.
Service is slow during weekends, waiting + queuing time >25mins as they have to cater for delivery orders and walk in orders.
Prices also recently increased for some items on the menu by 50cents to a dollar based on a flyer I saw."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNktHTFRREAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Not the original place but taste the same. Price of various pratas are ok, but specialty ones are quite ex. Their rice are quite tasty too. No windows in the place though, so it's quite stuffy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtelpQdEpnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Yishun safra feels pretty new and clean. Food was served hot and really good. Pricey for prata, but the creative menu is definitely worth trying out. Looking forward to try their next limited time special menu item."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla3NHRTVBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"I went to springleaf at yishun safra on 10th september 2022,. Order took more than half an hour with staff made no effort to inform how long I have to wait. Eating area is dirty and utensils not clean properly. Not sure if any inspection done for this outlet. The lady staff seems hostile and made no effort to apologise for being late in delivery service. Poor attitude. I ended up asking for a refund for some of my order."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMmZISFBREAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Went for dinner at 8pm, a quick 5 mins queue was needed to get in.

Ordered (between my friend and I): kambing soup, paper thosai, egg prata, mutton keema curry, chicken masala, seasonal vegetable, Bandung, limau ice

Kambing soup was extremely rich and flavourful! Prata and thosai were both really crispy. Mutton keema curry came in a very generous portion and was ridiculously tasty. Chicken masala was choke full of spices and you can really taste them. Cabbage was stewed to softness. Sweet drinks were decent, slightly expensive for the cup size.

Always a favourite for Indian food at yishun"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLazZDQVJBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,3,"Bought 2 Prata here,  Milky Prata (condensed milk) which costed ~$4 and Unami-50 (chicken floss + luncheon meat + cheese) which costed ~ $10 to take away. It has a rather small eating area.

The Prata was considered nice but too pricey and not really worth it. Although most prata shop in the area will have lesser creative varieties compared to them. Tried the mee goreng the second time as well and found it pricey too.

The price on grab is higher than in store so it is better to take away if it is walkable distance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOGRDNjJ3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,3,Place is small. The place is a bit stuffy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyenVXakNREAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Nice cosy outlet of popular local F&B  franchise and offers the full menu of items, served hot & fresh."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb3NxY0lBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"No queue and few empty tables on Sunday noon. Food served hot and made on the spot which I really like. Teh halia was good too.

Ordered tissue, plain and egg prata. Teh halia hot large. Adds up to 7.70"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleFBUMXlRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Very kampong style, a bit pricey, food is not too bad, if only their prata can be a little bit more crispy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MFAtZktBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Amazing springleaf pizza , great drinks and nice atmosphere."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1eThQSWRnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,Food is very nice. And fast!! Dont have to wait so long for the food!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OFpyZXRnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,3,"Happy with food and drink ordered. But wasn't impressed with the cashier staff who cleared tables, and swept crumbs and bits onto the floor instead of clearing it up properly. He even flicked the table cloth so that allthe stuff collected on it goes onto the floor!

Eye sore when you are eating and you see the dirtied floor and smashed food cos people stepped on it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNXVXZVJ3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Love the Ultimate series of dishes! I tried the Das Pratwurst which had yummy sausages inside, paired with curry and sauerkraut. The maggi goreng is excellent as usual too. Quick service and no-fuss meal. Thumbs up!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1d1pmNTdBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"As usual slow, and the server staff is impolite, including the chef. Ask for top up gravy for masala chicken, was informed no? First time I hear of this. Wanted pack thosai and was informed kitchen cannot cope?? Not making.. coffee, tea came quite cold, apparently left out in open before serve. Service need to improve and steamline items. Going downhill, as I don’t find it as good as before at springleaf branch. That outlet also have service issue. That is another story."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOHNhZUp3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,Small eating place but cam accommodate about 50 pax at one time. Good quality prata and very crispy. Curry is available for unlimiyed top up. Must try when you are nearby.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaDluZWxRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Took away the coin prata and it was still crispy! It's a thin dough but it is crispy on the outside. Like their coin prata more than their normal prata.

Update: went back to dine in and tried their egg mozzarella prata (super cheesy, love it), hi-fiber prata (taste like normal prata but healthier) and iced teh tarik (very sweet, not so good). There's fish and chicken curry available but you have to scoop yourself. No paywave here. Cash, shopeepay and favepay only."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eUwzbWNBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,2,"Having patronized their Springleaf branch for more than a decade and half, it saddens me to admit that their quality has slipped. It's not unexpected, given their expansion in recent years.

Today was an example of their lost standards. I ordered their regular teh tarik, as a takeaway. It was filled up just over a quarter of the packet and the quality was just not there.

It's a shame seeing the sham that has become of this brand. I had good years with friends and family at their Springleaf branch, but I can't say the same now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2VDd2ZnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"Disappointing.

Ordered a drink for takeaway, was asked to wait outside, but took about 25mins to deliver that 1 cup of teh tarik.

Went back in to check, then was told that the drink is left on the table, in a plastic bag carrier.

After clarifying that their cashier already charged me for the plastic cup, I still had to top-up cash for the plastic cup.. staff did not apologize after all that."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpNGFqdjVRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,4,Good mutton briyani & pratas no doubt. Only thing is their tables are always oily and dirty. Wipe with a tissue and behold the color change yourself. Nevertheless I'll still come back for the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlN3Zib0NBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,Came here was expecting good Prata but alittle disappointed. Curry also tasted quite weird and you have to scoop it yourself which doesn't make sense also in terms.of hygiene.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjd19ILUV3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"The wait is worth it. The restaurant is small, yet they did everything they could to ensure the patrons are kept comfortable. I can see if this place is maxed out on capacity the air conditioner will not be sufficient. Take note it's a self-service restaurant so you need to take your cutleries and the curry sauce (choose between chicken and fish). Do note that you will need to request for particular order for vegetarians. The  Mini ultimate murtabak is to die for, it's crispy and with cheese and dice chicken... Hmmm. And Teh Halia is also very well created - I had 2 cups in one seating."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTN2RqTFVREAE,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"This place has the one of the crispiest (but not as crispy as that in the Thomson branch) but their butter chicken is a no-go!! My friends and I ordered that to share last Saturday, and was shocked to get one piece of chicken thigh (pardon the half-eaten chicken but I only thought to snap a photo after digging in). It was barely enough for 2/3 people and i think it is $6.90 (correct me if i'm wrong). You get the idea! too expensive for just a chicken thigh covered in butter chicken sauce.

I ate their butter chicken at their other branch along Thomson area a few weeks ago and that was so much better, with decent portion of butter chicken.

Would recommend to go to their original branch as they have more decent portions and crispier prata."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpX0lqUVdnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Relatively long wait for the food on a Sunday morning. The place is in high demand from walk-ins and delivery takeouts. Had the murtaburger, which was very tasty and filling. Prices are higher than your average prata place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlck0ySWd3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Indoor, comfortable, with a very wide range of speciality dishes for both SAFRA members and non-members."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcVBXcmNnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,Quiet place to have a meal during weekdays. Food quality is good and price is reasonable.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyeFlyQ1Z3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,2,"Do careful when you order your mutaba. Please be present when they cook, don't make reservation and collect when is ready.

As the prata after cook tends to be oily, I once saw the one who packet, due to oily, he gotten a cloth from the kitchen guy to tap away oil at the mutaba.

After tap dry the food, the cloth was passed back to the kitchen and the cloth was used to clean the hot plate area.

So beware."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5c2NQQ09nEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Best thing about springleaf is their consistency across outlets.

Good variety of pratas. Best if they can open till late like 2-3am and earlier like 6-7am.

Good drinks as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPZzdmWjVnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"45 minutes still waiting for takeaway of 8 packets of briyani, not even crowded when we ordered."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeUtxa0p3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,Place is clean and nice. Not so many people. Prata are crispy and not oily.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcnRtd21nRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Nice prata. Specially the plain ones.

Order their Masala chicken. Came later so did not take pic. But it was really good to go with the prata."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbEkzdDhBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,Nice and cool place for great food and drinks. Located inside Safra Yishun.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3JQSUh3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"My only option for good Prata in Yishun, the quality mostly matches that of the outlet in Springleaf Road. The waiting is longer though, probably due to the smaller kitchen and staff size. Safra members get a small discount as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1M1ktTTFBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,3,Food a bit below expectations. Their main branch taste better especially the curry.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb09TbnBBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,Nice food. Nice place but alittle oily while dine in.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c0tYT0x3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,After a breezy stroll at the Gardens by the bay... Yummy! Had a really tasty Roti John smashed with generous amount of chilli and mayo. 😋😋😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLVl6ajBRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,4,Pretty good food. Don't reach a minute after 9:30pm if you want to dine in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb2F2THNRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,This is one of the many outlets of Springleaf Prata. They always serve soft crispy prata and delicious curry. This outlet is relatively small but yet cosy. Parking is expensive unless you park at the opposite block and cross over to the restaurant. Happy dining everyone. Cheers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bzZITTZ3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Visit again after relaxation of COVID, the taste maintain as per their standard. Will come again if crazing for prata."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5c082aVF3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Coin Prata is a “hot seller”, though it is just kosong but smaller, yet more ex. Cool name but not worth it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlME91QXRnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,4,Nice and relax place. Food are delicious 😋. Important Aircon is Power ..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaWNmN1pnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"Had 2 Plain prata, 1 Masala chicken and Lime juice. Plain prata was crispy and not too oily. It paired well with the Masala chicken. Place wasn't too crowded and did not have to wait long for my food. Will visit again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdjVTWUVREAE,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"An experience taste since day one, never fail to fulfill our needs. Teh tarik the best drink in the house. The crispy prata never ever dissappoint us, the quality of the food variety are wonderful. Fully recommended to all prata lover!

Happy tummy comes happy family."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhcnRiMUpBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"The place is clean and food preparation is quite fast.
Prata is crispy type but a bit small compared to normal stalls. Would need 3 pieces of 'kosong' to fill a meal... 😂
Tried with fish curry, no 'fishy' smell, spice not that overpowering... quite like it 😀
Food ordering feels a bit awkward blocking the narrow walkway at the entrance."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaU1pV0NBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,1,"Ordered takeaway at Yishun Safra Springleaf. There was no visible queue when I ordered. 5 mins later, queue started to build up and I waited for another 15 mins only to find out that my order was given to another person. Without a single apology and with a nonchalant attitude, I was told by one of the staff to wait. When asked for refunds, the staff refused and started yelling with the rest in Tamil. I stood there; got my refund eventually from a Chinese looking staff who was yelled at by a staff as well.

Not sure what is happening at Springleaf. While I enjoyed the food, no one deserved such treatment. Do consider looking into this matter please? You have just lost 4 patrons permanently. *Note: I did not raised my voice or make a scene. Just want to have a decent dinner that i am willing to pay for. - not anymore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NE8zM0NBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,2,"I felt I had gotten poor service.

Asked for chilli for my prata when their menu states chilli $0.6 (I didn't mind sambal or any chilli), they keep saying only got chilli sauce which I say okay.

Then they didn't wanna give, unlikely to return unless their food is so so amazing that I'm ok to tolerate the service standard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHa2FlUzN3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place,5,"Had prata, Briyani & Thosai. All were very good. Even the lime juice was well made (not too sour nor sweet). Ambience is good with distancing measures in place. Will definitely be back here again 👍🏻"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2MC1mUEJnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place,4,"The plain and egg prata were good. The exterior was crispy yet the in inside was soft and chewy. However, the fish curry was on the salty side otherwise it is good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OWFudUR3EAE,Syed Restaurant,4,Only came here for prata and teh halia…shiok. Service does get very slow when they are busy so come during off peak. Egg prata price is now $2.00 🙀 halal neighborhood restaurant
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eHFyMHFnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,1,Today I have mutton rice asked worker to put little extra piece. They charged $ 11.50 price. Which is ridiculous for the meal. They gave only curry apart one vegetable which is smelly and useless appalam. I mean not puffy. When I asked why are you charging this much simple answer for the extra piece. Day light robbery. When I asked for the break up they literally showing finger. Just pay or keep the food you ate.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aU9hRlVnEAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"Workers atitude is so horrible! I wanted to order Prata Tissue and they rejected my request as they told me they were busy with so many customers orders. And can't even make 1 piece of prata tissue 🙄 then after 15 mins sitting at the table while my family's food finished, I tried my luck again to order Prata Tissue as most of the customers has  leave the makan place, they accepted my order. How pathetic that is. And im complaining about prata tissue overall. Hahahaha"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNk9paFlBEAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"I'm not sure is the workers' attitude or lack of ingredients .. We were there to get our supper last night. Ordered mee goreng.. Maggi goreng.. Fried rice.. Sup kambing and nasi briyani. Mee goreng had nothing in it.. Just plain noodles with dark soya sauce.. Not even a stripe of beansprouts or vege..not even with sambal.. N yet tasteless at all.. We all were very very surprised n dissatisfaction with the food. Eat halfway n end up in dustbin chute. Haven't mentioned that each of the food was priced at 5-6 each. Sorry to say even hawkers economic noodles looks n taste better. Sup kambing was just spiced with water, only 4pieces of small cut of meat in the Sup..n not to mention was full of grease. Chicken Briyani rice just don't feel like it..to cut the bad time short.. Too harsh to say.. We hope you may cheat us that night... But hope that others will take note. That's our first and last. Next time we definitely go for McD. Thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldzhLSnNnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,Another delicious Indian Muslim foods restaurant. Just only seating capacity limited to 30 to 40 pax only. Parking space No problem
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXA3NFZREAE,Syed Restaurant,1,Ordered masala thosai and one of its gravy was totally bland zero taste. After making payment told the guy at counter about it and his answer was that’s how it is supposed to taste like. Wow. Ego too big i guess. Anyway other food I order wasn’t nice too actually. Nasi goreng kerabu taste more like rice with white pepper. Good luck to those trying 😎
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOHNyQTBRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,"I had ordered a Mee Goreng last, last night. We waited and waited. We saw them serving other customers first. (we were regular customers in the day, so they probably did not recognize us) After 45 min, a customer said that is too long and left. So, we decided to go also. But before we told them we are gonna leave, we asked them if they are going to give us the food. All of the workers in the restaurant were very responsible except one person. He is the person at ordering station. After we had asked him, he said that if you can't wait, then leave. We had waited for almost 1 hour.
The cook came and said that he already cooked a lot. That is when the reason for the problem came. The person who shouted at me actually served his regular customers. The cook knew us. He tried to calm me down and gave the food to us. We said thank you to the chef and left. So, only the person who was at the the ordering station was irresponsible. Now, you might know the reason why they serve your food very late. Thank you for taking your time to read this!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcnIyYjNRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,Delicious and fast service even sometimes very crowded
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMG9fQUdnEAE,Syed Restaurant,5,"Awesome prata as always. *Don't change it! Yes, I like fried chicken briyani too 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMU5xUHl3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,Reasonably good local food but slightly expensive in my view. Try it as it's 24hrs open.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtb3E2bHZnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,A little dirty but the food is hella good. The service is good too. Just the floor and tables looked oily. But I guess it's kinda normal? But anyway it's super good. Really recommend for eating at night. The atmosphere feels really warm.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJMnA2OHNRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,They will test your patience. Even though it was not that busy on this Saturday night 10 pm they kept me waiting 15 minutes for my banana prata untill I finish my teh tareh..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMFBENDR3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,Not much choice of food after 2am.....but still service is good

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrM29yUHl3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Good place to hang out with friends, especially at night as it is open 24 hours. The good is good and the price is also reasonable. Very good prata can be found here."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwX2ViSk1nEAE,Syed Restaurant,4,"Used to always patronized this place during yesteryears. Came back and it still e same. thou I miss the 'used to have' nasi lemak there but still the current food is still good, service and atmosphere still e same. I enjoyed!"

But  now they abit arongant and only really serve outsider we regular they never really serve and waiting time is longer for us and also they abit stingy with the condiment and garnishes... eg cucumber sauces
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHVHWHRRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Visit this shop early in the morning to meet up with friends. The place is not crowded. Alot of seats are available during my visit. The service is as expected in an Indian Muslim restaurant. They will accede to your request without hassle. The food we order in the morning are the obvious, which is Prata. The crowds start to build up after 8am. If meeting friends or just to fill up for breakfast, nothing fancy, this place will do."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cl9TaFFBEAE,Syed Restaurant,5,"Use the kiap to take the rojak, there is the typical fried potato, fried square beancurb, hotdog which are fried, fried fillet fish, flour items which are fried, contains some fried egg or vegetable. There is fried prawn on a fried flour or just mass fried small prawn on flour. There is also fried sotong available. Once you have chosen the items, they will refry it to perfection. Comes with cucumber"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5X3NhemdRRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,"the service was bad ! asked for fish curry but gave dalca and took them a good 10 minutes (YED I TIMED IT) to change the gravy when the prata is already served . i overheard 1 of the waiter said to a lady customer ""next time say extra sweet la"" in a unhappy tone . patronise at your own will ."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnZ051Q1FnEAE,Syed Restaurant,4,"The food is worth the price. the service is always quick. You get Indian food too - dosa, chapathi, idly."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anFTV1pREAE,Syed Restaurant,1,"My family and I was craving for prata. We ate few times but today’s experience was horrible. Upon reaching a table, there’s an ipad left on the table beside the table we are located. I partially open the cover of ipad and check if someone has left it, but I decided to move it away from our table and leave it. About 15mins later a Lady confronted us and say next time dont touch, ask around and thats how she reserved the table. She talked to us in a bad tone. We apologised and keep quiet. The mentioned lady was apparently working in the shop. After few minutes, a guy, who is working also in the shop, talked to us and said “what she said was right? Do you have something to say?” Then we defend ourselves. They embarrassed us in front of many people which is not a customer service. To the owner of this shop, may review the cctv and investigate on the incident. A belonging that is valuable shouldnt be left unattended. Such behaviour is unacceptable for customer service. A proper and mannerly approach should be considered. Hope you can take action on this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNZ0tia2dnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,"Large amount of Indian and Malai food varieties available here,.. I personally like their service, maintanance and their coffee. For food taste i would like to give 5 stars ratings, but in hygienic matter can give 3 stars only. Overall it's recommendable place to have good food in Yishun."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbHJqU1lnEAE,Syed Restaurant,4,Eaten egg and plain prata here. Teh tarik with ginger is nice. Ordered mine with reduced sugar 😊

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbU4yYmd3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,"Varieties of food available, well served by their staff, operating 24hrs and convenient cark parking nearby."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVODVyX1FnEAE,Syed Restaurant,5,"I will not beat around the bush, the Indian food is really good! This is a little hidden gem in the rough. Not many know about it, but those who do, swear by it. Hands down the best Mee Goreng Mamak and Teh Tarik in the north! I have tried most of their dishes, and none disappoint. Do give it a try if you're around the area!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM29Xc3NBRRAB,Syed Restaurant,3,Food is gud but the service is late....need wait take time
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMHRXZ1RREAE,Syed Restaurant,5,"Good service, helpful staff. I must say that they have since upgraded their rojak sauce, it is now comparable to Ministry of Rojak."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpLWZDeUxREAE,Syed Restaurant,5,"One of the best midnight food haunts within Yishun.

Offers plenty of our local Indian food options, prata, murtabaks, mee gorengs and what nots.

Price wise, definitely more worth than its competitors within the area.

Parking space are never a hassle. Plenty of available lots."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNeXBhaXF3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,"Great briyani sold here. Chicken rice and other  malay stall also not bad. The only issue here is, need to wait very long for drinks that have been ordered."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnOHZLcmRREAE,Syed Restaurant,4,Not the best prata in the north but still is a good prata. The rest of the food is quite average depending on the cook for the day. So the food isnt that standardise. Fast service and good value for money. The place is accessible by bus with about 4-5 minutes of walking. You could generally find a parking space here. The place is clean and the people serving are friendly.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5ek1QREt3EAE,Syed Restaurant,4,"Friendly staff, Great food Great drinks!. However i think location wise can be improved as its very hot n humid there"

ice water is now 50 cents a cup up from 30 cents before.

no more smoking area too.
so smokers take note."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MEltbUhREAE,Syed Restaurant,4,The food was good. Most the food in the menu was not available. Had to order 3 times before I go to eat.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncDhXdjB3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,1,No quality and expensive.. $7 for a plate of so called “seafood” hor fun with only 1 not fresh small prawn and few pieces of sotong at a void deck Coffeeshop..  when we double check with the menu it was only written as $6 and they even argue because I ask for seafood? Hmmm... better watch it when you do decide to come here to eat..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvajRqMWdnRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Excellent teh halia (tea with a ""kick"" - ginger water). The roti john (no human flesh here, just a nice toasted baguette with scrambled egg, roasted chicken chunks, tomato-barbeque sauce and mayonnaise!) was fantastic, the nasi goreng ikan bilis (fried rice with crunchy fried little fish) was fresh and hot! Will try other dishes next time..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a19IdDl3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,it's my one of the favourite restaurant food and drinks taste yummy amazing 👏 😋
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOFktWXZBRRAB,Syed Restaurant,5,"Nice food everytime. Over the years their service improved, even though they are busy they still managed to serve us on time."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNllXVFRBEAE,Syed Restaurant,4,A good Indian restaurant in neighbour around Yishun church. They sell South Indian Halal food. The restaurant is stretched over 4 shops in a raw selling a large verity of Indian food. Their Prata Bom (prata with cheese and condensed milk in it) tastes great. Will go again for sure.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVeDhldnd3RRAB,Syed Restaurant,4,Awesome Indian food. Great prata and curry (fish). Generally almost everything you order here is great-tasting especially from their Thai menu.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMDh1dkdREAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Unassuming place that serves decent roti prata. What's interesting is that the prata is served with 2 different curries as well as sambal ikan bilis.
One curry is the regular type served with  prata; it's not bad, but watered down. The second curry is loaded with spices, not the chilli or pepper kind of spice, more like cardamom and turmeric, etc. It's interesting cos at the other places I've tried that serves 2 curries, one would usually be curry and the other would be dahl.
This is my first visit to Meera's; and judging from the rather extensive menu, I suspect that their prata, while decent enough, is not their specialty. I'm sure some of their dishes must be great, or they wouldn't have more than one branch. If I'm in the area again, I may return and try out some other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNnF1M3lBRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Price 3/5
Food 3/5
Ambience 3/5
Overall 3/5

Price is pretty much reflective of the food. The prata taste like an average prata, but I love the big bag of papadom they have. The papadom sells at $1.20.

Curry is the watery type, mildly spicy.

Had the teh halia. Ginger taste is mild, tea isn't very sweet unlike usual Muslim restaurant where the tea is diabetic.

Will return here if I'm craving for some prata while around this area. Otherwise wouldn't make a special trip down to this place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMXBuRm1nRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,1,"After receiving my drink, most of the ice already 3/4 melted. So I went to ask for more ice added. The boss himself added the ice for me. Upon payment I was told my drink (Ice lemon tea) cost $4. I was shocked & asked why so expensive? The staff said my drink was $2.50 & the added ice was $1.50! I ask why so expensive for ice & he said extra ice is $1. So now from $1.50 become $1. I said it's too expensive to the staff & it was reduce again this time to 50cents. I'm never coming back to this place again & I'd advise anyone the same as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMXJqcHdBRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,Had Prata and Tea here!!! Highly recommended. The oil used in the preparation is fresh. Order taking is promptly attended to and payment is straightforward. Most important.... Reasonably priced. Awesome breakfast place on a Saturday morning. Located at Springleaf MRT station.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta0tPdGhnRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Indian Muslim style eatery offering a wide variety of common dishes like dosai, prata, muthabak, etc. attentive service if a bit understaffed, but they hold a candle next to Springleaf just a few units away. A good place to drop by for Parthia if you don’t want to wait too long, Portions are larger than most places.

Be wary of the pricing though, as it’s not transparent - our single-person murtabak was ‘upsized’ without telling us.

Try the rava masala dosai."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMmQyaXl3RRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,Nice and made to order fresh prata. Curry sauce is nice and thick. The ice teh Tarik is sweet & thick. The Horlick Godzilla is unique. The murtabak is delicious and savoury. How I prefer it cut in squares instead of triangles. Overall recommended.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcmJDQXVnRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,2,"The teh was nice. The normal basic prata or masala prata was good serve with 2 dip curry and ikan bilis  sambal. The murtabak came well presented but sad to say one of the worst I have tasted. One side was badly burnt and hard unable to cut through. The top was lightly fried and soft . Boiled mince mutton without much marination was added in it . Second slice I really feel yucky even though I have submerge each bite piece into the curry. The chicken curry was a little diluted , taste of curry leaf and powder not much spices and punch in their curry."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHNVpLSnJBRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,4,"3.9 🌟 for first visit experience. Their prata is dry chewy type. I like the kosong but not the egg one. The unique thing is besides the two usual curry you get (dal n fish etc), they have this nice sambal ikan bilis! It's spicy sweet. Gives the bite a different taste and texture. The dal curry also very different from those usual ones I had (some unique taste like minty which I could not figure out). I had my prata with teh tarik.. I requested for kurang kurang manis (less less sweet 😅). Turn out it was just nice. Staff were friendly. Generally clean. They even sell some puffs and such snacks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2czlHTE5REAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Friendly and affordable pricing,  I like the prata that come with ikan bilis sambal chilli,  not as usual in Singapore prata eateries"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MGVDQkdBEAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,4,Fluffiest prata that i have ever tasted.Liked the sambal though its abit cold. Overall a good experience very chilled n old school atmosphere.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRakt1a2RREAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Food is tasty and the price is very reasonable. Got enough variety for most guys to come here around 3 times a week. They got Briyani, prata fried Malay food and their outlets are all halal. The restaurant is clean and their service is decent. Would've given it 4 stars if the toilet was cleaner/in better quality and had toilet rolls."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOThfUjVRRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,5,"They open early around 7 AM. Busy from the many contract workers coming to buy their co-workers their meals for the day in the morning. So their stuff is always moving and fresh. Prata, dosai and bryani are the usual here and you cannot go wrong with them. Affordable and now even more accessible from Woodlands via the TEL. Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eF9EMG5BRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,3,"Crab curry is very salty n fresh coconut served w hard flesh.

They are friendly and served a nice chicken Briyani!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dzdUdm9nRRAB,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,2,"First off, we were given the wrong order even after repeated confirmations. We were given one egg prata less but as it was a take away, we could not rectify the error.

The prata was one of the least nice prata our family has eaten. It was very oily and ""doughy"".
The dhal curry was a huge disappointment.

Will not recommend this place unless you have a prata craving that desperately needs to be satisfied."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvNS1iX01nEAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,1,Food portion is big and generous but doesn't taste very good. Dishes are sub par or salty. Briyani no standard. Nasi goreng is bland and soggy although generous ingredients. Basically their cooks are not skilled.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eG9uQ2FBEAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,1,"Complete rip off. My first and most definitely my last time eating there ever.
Had a few of their individual dishes and all of it tasted terrible. Oh and the prawn sambal, No idea why it was so sweet. I almost thought I was eating some sort of dessert."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndzlQY0RBEAE,Meeras Curry Banana Leaf Restaurant,4,Good curry. And good variety of South Indian / Malay food. Normal service as seen in other Singapore curry houses which means nothing to compliment about but is ok if you are there only for your curry fix!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbFlfOW1RRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,1,"Measly portion for something worth $28. Overhyped and over rated. And give 2 small containers for sauce. The standard cucumber and onion also nowhere to be found.. like only a handful of those.. literally handful. Buyer beware, if you want to waste money, there are other places with more portion that can give cheaper and same quality"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXMm9IRzZRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,2,"Ordered the vegetarian mee goreng found the taste wasn't as I expected from an Indian Muslim stall. The mee is too dry, I prefer slightly oily mee goreng.
The mee goreng found at Yishun hawker centre is much better."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOWZ1RlRnEAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"Good quality was ok-good. Hot drink portion was small given the price point. Definitely smaller than usual Coffeeshop glass mug quantity.

Service was-meh. The young gentleman mending the cashier counter was rude. I paid with a $50 note and he immediately told me “give me smaller note”. I had to explain that I just went to the ATM before he reluctantly accepted my payment.

The same staff also mixed up the order of another customer, giving her putih fried rice instead of merah. Customer was upset and mentioned that they should have asked instead of assuming that “Chinese only eat putih, not merah goreng”. No attempt to apologize or to exchange the food, just insisted that it is as it is."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0pUcjVRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,"Ordered Indian rojak and Nasi goreng ikan bilis.

Rojak tasted almost similar to the original one at Ayer rajah food centre.

The Nasi goreng lacks the “kick” but still good.

I must say, the service can be improved. Most of the times, they’re talking to one another."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLOEpXSTJRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,Unhealthy but delicious. Die Die Must try!  We are here again on September 25.  Delicious!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLbEtlWHZRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,1,"Review as a delivery rider.

Popular but Frustratingly slow.

Simply because they only start to queue the ordered item for frying WHEN the rider arrives.
Yes, queue behind all the other in-stall orders at the store. EVEN though your order came in 20-30mins ago..

So be prepared to wait more than an hour easy during peak hours.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMkxHWXJBRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,3,2nd visit - Self service for this stall. The rojak taste nice and fresh but the pricing a bit on the high end. Teh tarik was good. As there are limited seating area thus it quite hard to find a table during peak hour but you are allowed to seat at the foodcourt seating area.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4cEktWll3EAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"Weekday order 1pm, 2 teh aliah and 1 mee goreng. Ordered spicy mee goreng so i can only assume he adhered to my request by sprinkling some chili padi. Taste of mee goreng is mediocre, tea was a little sweet. Waiting time is long by normal standards. Total damage $8.60! I presume tea costs $1.80 each.  Meegoreng 5$. Same price as Adam Road or Newton. At least the one in newton come with a sunny side up.. not coming back again unless price is on the signboard."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3bHZlTXpBRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,3,"This place is always packed with hungry diners. However, the quality and taste can be rather inconsistent. Ordered their beehoon goreng twice. The first time was simply delicious. Fried to perfection. Sadly, the second time i ordered it was terrible. It was so salty that I left without touching much of it. A total waste of money. To be fair, the Indian rojak was good. The rojak sauce either make or breaks the overall satisfaction. The sauce was spicy and the consistency was just right. Would recommend the Indian rojak. Please give a 'LIKE' for this review ya. Thanks"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHY3c2p3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,2,"Over-rated and expensive. There are much better and cheaper Indian Rojak outlets in Yishun; Yishun Park Hawker Centre (NK), Chong Pang (Elahe)..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMzRHTzF3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,1,"1st time here.
1) Rojak & bee hoon going nearly 40sgd. We didn't even ordered much. Same rojak items taken from hawker would only cost max 15sgd.
2) Ordered white bee hoon but came red been hoon. When i told counter wrong order, he blamed me which I told him i ordered right and he acknowledged. Portion so little...
3) Long waiting time. I finished my rojak then came the been hoon. Wrong bee hoon, changed...took even longer...
Just a hyped up & overrated rojak place, taste about the same as any hawker centre's. Not worth the price, but rojak is acceptable anyways. Oh well...but then.. go hawker centre more worth it la...trust me!"

When made pymt i ve told the cashier who's also taking order that pls give me more gravy n she said ok. But this male staff was so rude didn't want to give yet grumbling. Felt so angry.
What a terrible service!!!!."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxX0wyM2JnEAE,Ministry of Rojak,1,Extremely long waiting time (45mins) for ONE nasi goreng. All others ordering rojak got served 1st. Not recommended if you are in a rush.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5anBqMkRBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"I wonder have this store changed new boss??
Their services are not as good as the previous I'd visited, just one customer next to me asking for some more 🌶 chilli, and he only just given a piece, and the customer immediately get shocked ""what is this!"". Later my turn, I softy asked for more cutter onions, he just pointed on my plate and said that's the onions ( a fewest pieces). Not Good😤😥"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM05mSUlnEAE,Ministry of Rojak,4,Interesting little Rojak outlet. Price I feel is reasonable and the food is fresh and hot when served. The source is less nutty then usual but still well made.  While the place is a bit dirty I must say but you should try the food still. The cashier is quite is a funny guy 😁
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcWRidXZnRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,"The food always cooked fresh. The rojak & sauce are yummy. Try the ginger tea(ask for less sugar) is refreshing. Dining area is cramp so be sure to pack home.
No pictures for these cos all in the tummy.....  Next time perhaps if I remember 😅"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcnVEZWh3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,Food is great but the place is kind of cramped
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzbXZpUHBRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,The Indian rojak is a must try! Eat it with the sauce.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjcmFHd3dRRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,The rojak and the gravy is really delicious. They give you a good amount of gravy. Do take note that there is a 10 cents charge for an extra glass if you want to share your coffee.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4MTUtcDZBRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,"Variety selection of freshly prepared food items for rojak and gravy is good too..not very sweet and not too spicy! The only Indian shop in Northpoint that sells rojak, mee goreng, nasi goreng, mee kuah & etc and variety also drinks such as teh tarik and teh with ginger and other drinks too with reasonable price in shopping centre."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDc01DUEZBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,5,One of the best Rojak sauce in town. Slightly more spicy than the others.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5dE9DMUZREAE,Ministry of Rojak,5,"Awesome food, awesome service! I must say they are very polite and friendly. Seen how some customers talk very rudely to them and they endure it all. Hats off to the team. Will continue to support them and recommend them to my family and friends!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdzg3dU5REAE,Ministry of Rojak,5,"Good South Indian fare at affordable prices. Quality maintained at all times and if you are having the rojak, don't forget to ask for more gravy! Relaxed, no frills dining experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbE5XNzJ3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,3,Nothing special for the hike up price for the food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cU9mT1hREAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"Trying mee goreng at this place.
Food 3/5
Ambiance 3/5
Value for money 3/5"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRejVhVDBnRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,Lots of prawns on prawn fritters. Food arrived hot and crispy. Taste of dipping sauce was spot on. Asked for refill of sauce. Waiter obliged. Not thirsty after meal. Totally satisfied. Will only eat from them from now on.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVamNiakxBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,1,"We were charged $4.50 for a piece of paru (lungs) inside the rojak. Gravy is tasty.

We hope you can be more practical on the pricings. Your pricing board says depends on size without even weighing the items. You do not practise offering customers a receipt for their purchase."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNeXBDQ0pnEAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"Just to share experience. This evening on 25 Dec 2019. We ordered take away rojak for $26/-. We asked for onion, green chilli and cucumber. When reaching home we opened up the packet and found out the man gave one slice of onion and cucumber each and one green chilli besides the rojak we ordered. It was good lesson for me. Next time pls check first before leaving."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNFlfTjN3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,Food good only do not understand why the gravy are being charged $1.00 with portion given are sometimes too much ending up throwing away. Rather they do not charge for the gravy and give appropriate portion rather than going to waste on efforts cooked.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLMHR1elVBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,"Limited seats space,  overall their foods are fairly nice, their rojak gravy is the best taste except they shld reduce the colouring"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcGZqaXRnRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,1,"Bad experienced today, staff very rude. Nagging, bad temper, bear brunt and attack customer from counter then Start charging outside the counter and to the dining table. Worst still bad mouthing customer with other patrons such an attitude and unprofessional... only stop when I started to record a video and intended to call police. So childish and easily get offended by small miscommunication over Teh O Kosong and when I took the shop pictures... keep nagging and grumpy like old man.

A man attacking women over small matter? Thats so uncalled for. Consider to report to police, I have the videos. Oh another man also came to our dining table and after I recorded him ... he walked away immediately. You guys gangsters?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHX2V5bHd3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,1,Ordered takeaway on 7 Nov and got home to realise the wrong order given to me. I paid more and got less. Disappointing.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpMXR6cFd3EAE,Ministry of Rojak,4,"The food is nice, especially the sauce. Seating places are limited, especially during this Covid period. Expect the price to be higher, given that it is located inside Northpoint mall."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd2VYOVJBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,4,Suberp rojak gravy  can ask for another cup if nt enough cause i like to dunk e goodies in e gravy with spoon...other dishes also available like ur regular mee goreng beef steak mee kuah n lots more ...plz come to discover😋😋😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbnZtRVZBEAE,Ministry of Rojak,5,"Enjoyed Good food
Although seats are limited we had to wait for our seats"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzNU1LV1hREAE,Ministry of Rojak,4,Nice Rojak!!! The gravy is superb and food is fresh. Something to try when you r not in the mood to choose something. Simple food but delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdU1ISDRnRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,"Mee goreng pretty decent. Kitchen and ordering counter is on one side while seating area is across the path that pedestrians walk by, making it a little tricky."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dFA3YzZnRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,2,Rojak was good but waiting time is damn slow. If you in rush don't bother to order . Atleast waiting time is 30mins
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNnVmVC1nRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,3,prices for rojak is INSANE !! squid and lungs priced at the size of the item ! 1 small squid + 1 small lungs + 3 empty dough + 1 fish fillet & a can of coke cost SGD 19 !!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTcUxlTjl3RRAB,Ministry of Rojak,4,"Should reduce the gravy colouring ,must be hot 🔥 and spicy. Try to imitate the gravy of 1960's at Bras Basah Rd."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4OE15bWdBRRAB,Ministry of Rojak,5,"My favourite Indian rojak place.. till now I haven't find anything better than this. Those who visited Northpoint, must give it a try! You will not regret it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaW83akd3EAE,Ministry of Rojak,3,Food is alright. Service is slow. I mean if I am supposed to take my own utensils stop putting them inside the counter.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNmIySVN3EAE,Semma Singapore,4,"Food wise it is good but drink wise I find the teh halia not enough ormph. The chicken curry is good but the fish curry is a bit let down as I find it missing the depth of flavor that I always look for in a nice curry.

We ordered the Tasha Special Murtabak ($15). It is FULL of ingredients. It has cheese, mutton, ham, egg, mushroom, capsicum and tons of other stuff. Surprisingly it goes nicely together. 5 stars here.

The mee goreng is the wet style. It spicyness level is there and it has nice chunky potatoes and tau kwa. It has a thick sauce coating every strand of the noodles. Nice!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NVlhOFZREAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Wonderful chill out and burst of flavourfl experience. They accommodate to your taste buds in cooking. Must tries are their murtabak, sardine satti soru. Drinks are reasonable and affordable. If you drink Guinness theirs is very refreshing.  If you drink whiskey their per bottle price is also reasonable. A fulfilled weekend hangout for me."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWUtNEN3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Had a nice evening out with frens at this new kid on the block- Semma bar. Nice ambience, cosy, great for dinner or just hanging out with frens. The food was exceptionally good, especially the very tender mysore mutton which came on a hotplate. We also tried the prawns, roti john, mutton satti soru, some sharing platter and a fried ikan bilis with onion dish which went very well with drinks. They also had some interesting drinks like Thalapathy and Nayagan! Was full house by 8pm... in short, a nice hangout with great food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeWNiai13RRAB,Semma Singapore,5,Revamped from Tasha Restaurant to Semma Bistro. Good upgrade. The atmosphere is cool and food has a good variety. Recommended goto place. Sati soru (claypot rice)  mutton is a must try.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1LThUMmVREAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Really friendly staff that were willing to go through the menu. Main point though, the food is absolutely mind-blowing! Had their Roti Canai, Satti Sorru & the Commandoes, all just other worldly. The Commandoes though, a unqiue fry of sambal, ikan bilis, tauhu, fries and hotdogs might sound weird, but its worth more than a shot, and their curry was awesome!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2M05tNVl3EAE,Semma Singapore,4,"We were invited by a friend to have dinner at her neighborhood's Indian restaurant, Tasha's. The restaurant itself is bright and clean, simple layout. Ordered to share. Their claypot fish head curry was fresh, though we wished the gravy was less diluted. Masala squid was a yummy rice-topper. Prices are easy-on-the-wallet too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMVltWm5BRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Brand New Concept and Ambience..
Excellent hospitality and energy from the crew!

I had their commando satti soru and mutton murtabak. It was sooo good!

The satti soru was perfectly done with the shiok level of spiciness, crunchy ikan bilis and curry leaves.

Mutton Murtabak was perfect. Generous filling of Moist and tender meat. And the accompanying gravy was also full of flavour and thickness for a dip. Aesthetically pleasing presentation!

Ambience was pure comfort. Loved the fusion of nature with their furnishings.
Warm lighting to complement the wood. It takes you away from the bustling street and activity just right outside.

Definitely going to be a regular! See yall there!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z3FYcGhBRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Here for a slightly late lunch at 1.00pm and we were surprised to know that the lunch time crowd just left 😆 delighted cos we were famished!

Masala Mutton Biryani - WOW 😍 the basmati rice was cooked to perfection! It was fluffy, fragrant and flavourful. We appreciate the thoughtfulness in separating of spices from the rice -  One of the ""landmines"" while eating briyani is to accidently crew into a cardamon🤦🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️ The mutton curry - tender and welll flavoured - had just enough spiciness to give the right amount of ""kick"".  Generous amounts of crispy crunchy Papadam enough for two to share 😁✌️

Prata Volcano Chicken Steak Combo is a visual treat indeed 🤩 A mind-blowing and creative twist to the standard teloh prata, along with a nicely marinated fusion chicken steak served with fries. 🍗🍟

Although we were famished, the portions were huge enough for 3 to share! 🤯 We will definitely be back to this joint for more! 😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXb0xMWmdBRRAB,Semma Singapore,3,"Nice cosy ambience no crowd on sat morning, thosai served was burnt on the sides.. Service can be improved, prices are very modest... Manager a young man not so friendly and helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycnY2UW53RRAB,Semma Singapore,4,"The teh tarik here is foamy and smooth. Not bad! But chicken briyani rice was cold, think they didn’t heat up, maybe can improve on this."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOGJXYTRRRRAB,Semma Singapore,4,"We booked for our Primary school gathering ,we have dinner at Semma  Indian restaurant, The restaurant itself is bright and clean, simple layout. Their food was delicious though the spicy level was high .. the staff are very polite except  for one lady she came over and ask us how's the food so we told her food was very nice but the spicy level are high in some food and her reply was   ""O uncle every one comes here and say they love the spicy level."" but not everyone love spicy right? When we order the food , you were there helping us to do the ordering, you should advise the spicy level so we can tell you to reduce the level for us, Anyways thanks for the help , after that a guy with long hair came and ask us how's the food ,we told him the same issue but he was more polite and friendly to advise us with a better reason.  Prices are easy-on-the-wallet too. thanks to Semma keep it up!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbUtTUzBnRRAB,Semma Singapore,4,"Dining experiences @ Tasha’s have been great so far! One of our frequent go to joints. Service is always good! Friendly and alway ready to take feedback. The aunties always come forward to check if the meals are all good. We had tried the prata, thosai, both chicken and mutton biryani, murtabak, mutton chop and tea. The food is really good and better than what we had at Springleaf. Generally, the food is not too salty or overly sweet. Meats are always soft and well cooked. Curries are rich and flavorful. It does not leave a heavy queasy feeling after the meals. You can ask for a lesser sugar Tehs… and the tea does not have the astringency of the tea (not “siap”)."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyb3VmTXdRRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,I placed an order on the day itself for a party of 10 guests and was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant agreed. What I appreciated most was that I was advised to place the order in a way that would save me money. The food arrived on time and the portions were substantial. Our guests enjoyed the food very much. Thank you!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN2R2MURBEAE,Semma Singapore,5,Went on 1 Apr. Impressed with the chicken curry and volcano prata. Yummy food. The dosai is also crispy. Must try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NGJHanZnRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"The Tasha Murtabak is a huge portion with loads of ingredients inside such as chicken, cheese, capsicum, mushrooms and others. We tried the chicken bryani, limau O and tasha's teh. Highly recommended as well. The staff are friendly and warm!! Homey feels."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOEppdXZ3RRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"This is one place where the food is as authentic as it gets! Nice ambience and even nicer staff makes this a go-to place for anyone who wants to taste what spicy indian food really tastes like. It ain't over the top, but don't say I didn't warn ya"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcW9Ua3B3RRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"I think semma singapore, has a mix of culture, ambience and great food. All the food was extremely amazing and tasty but my fav has to be the sizzling mysore mutton! I have ate mysore mutton in many places, but the sizzling mysore mutton, at semma singapore, has the perfect blend of spices to it, the cashew with dried chilli with the mutton being so tender, was definitely something i enjoyed. I liked the blend of drinks, and the service as well. I love the fact that the owners were so hospitable to their customers and made them feel like home. I would totally recommend Semme Singapore to anybody, who loves  to have a blend of great ambience, service, food, drinks and music! Everyone of you should so try it!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMDY3emZBEAE,Semma Singapore,5,"It’s was my birthday treat at this restaurant. The food and the ambiance was fantastic!!! The dishes were different and so sooo delicious. I love the sambal stingray Bakar and mutton Satti sorru .
I must give a shout-out to staff Mathi for his great service and hospitality at seema . Thank you staff (Naren & mathi )of semma for allowing me to celebrate my birthday there at 12 mn giving us abit of time to clear up our food and drinks .
Thank you for your wishes too. The food, service & ambiance made my day."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTX29lZFhREAE,Semma Singapore,4,"Was in this area and dropped by here for lunch. Similar concept to a competitor outlet at rail mall, this is a much better offering. Perhaps it’s due to the weekday lunch hour, it wasn’t crowded. And we were well served by the staff. We waited a while for the food to be prepared.

The egg prata is doughy, not the crispy type. I love the curry though. Both served hot and fresh.

Just as fresh and hot is the Briyani. Even the fish is hot. I like the fluffy rice.

The coffee is not to my taste, but it’s decent enough. Nice clean environment. Couldn’t find the toilet tho. There’s a wash basin. Price wise perhaps a tad cheaper than the rail mall competitor.

Fans of Indian fare who want gd decent food in upp Thomson road area can consider checking this place out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcXRfUkp3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,Semma indeed served a hearty and rich flavourful dishes! It's must to try prawn and mutton satti sooru. Definetly a delightful experience in overall. Me and my family truly enjoyed!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleXJlSE13EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Very nice and chill ambience, tasty food (must try the mutton satti soru - claypot rice) and affordable drinks (their Guinness on tap is refreshingly good). Definitely recommend to head down with family and friends!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bklTWXhRRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Semma serves up some of the best Indian food I've had! The satti sorrus are great and the mysore mutton is a must try. Great food. Great priced drinks.
11/10 recommend 🙌🏾"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MW9XbDlBRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Very nice Ambiance and the food was Excellent , we had the mutton gravy , murtabak , roti-john , pepper prawn, sati soru - and platter - all tasted delicious!!!  The chef was very efficient in getting the order ready:)
Feedback for the service crew: Base on your seating capacity and staff strength I think you can render even better service , food arrives faster than the beverages and there could be more proactiveness from the service staff. Secondly I know the F&B sector is moving towards digitalization in terms of food ordering and QR code scanning but to a certain extend service staff can still hold onto a device to take 2nd and adhoc orders from customers as there should still be some level of tolerance towards manual food ordering.
But it is still a 5 STAR* because ""Good food don't go wrong"" and I am sure you will rectify your service in future."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbWZXLV9BRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,Glad to hv found this cool hangout spot. Good food. Friendly staff.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDOWNYc0xREAE,Semma Singapore,4,"Very clean restaurant with good air conditioning, no food smell stain after visit.
The curry for the masala dosai was delicious.
Teh halia is totally not up to standard."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cjUtMEV3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Ample carpark around, just need to find it.
At the corner of the row of shop houses.

First, the temperature scanning machine was the most advanced I had ever seen. Temperature taking and QR code all in one.

Wide variety of food. The menu showed a lot of food. However, the fish tail curry was sold out.
Service was alright. The food took a bit of time.
The curry fish head was fresh. Not bad. With lady fingers inside. Nice...
Also the plate of rice was very big. Could serve 2 pax.

The toilet was behind the kitchen. Need to walk outside to get to the toilet. Now let’s discussed about the toilet.
There was this saying, to know the cleanliness of the restaurant, you just need to take a look at the toilet. The toilet was amazing clean. Therefore I was quite certain the food would be hygienic.

Air conditioning was just nice taking into consideration of the hot weather.

Will definitely come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOHJUNkxnEAE,Semma Singapore,5,I love their food and ambience. Reasonable price. Friendly owners. Pls reserve table before going. Bring along friends and family.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dnIycW1nRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,Amazing food quality wide choices of the Indian menu in a cozy bar cum restaurant  environment staff very friendly items ordered get delivered fast managed by very experienced operational managers.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc29iVjJnRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"mutton briyani - very hearty and tasty, thick gravy, flavorful rice and tender mutton; a cut above the rest that you would get at typical Indian Muslim restaurants. I’m a fan of thosai too and theirs doesn’t disappoint, it tends to sell out by around 11:30am on weekends. Volcano prata is yummy too with runny yolk, crispy prata. Comfortable and clean air conditioned environment"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXazlEMi1BRRAB,Semma Singapore,1,"An old plesant man greeted us with a smile.
Next a young chap with beared answered rudely we dont serve Thalcha when i asked. What else curry he again rudely told us to go to our table.
ALL the while both me n my friend were wearing MASK he was not wearing a MASK.
We decided to PAY n Leave without touching the food.
He must be angry with something but should not treat  customers badly.
Noticed a previous review by another Indian customer shared a similar bad treatment,
A pattern?

edit: in response to your reply-
Thank you for acknowledging my review. The first step towards making improvement is acknowledgment. Even if there are other sides to the story as you claim. I don’t think you wish for even 1 customer of your restaurant to leave with such an impression. Hopefully this will be the last time you receive such a review. Also if you were as attentive as you claim you staff would have realised we didn’t even touch our meal and the fact that it wasn’t addressed then itself and payment was accepted may be evidence enough for the lack of interest of your staff. We hope you see to this that such episodes don’t happen again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTVYX0NBEAE,Semma Singapore,5,The food is good especially the commando.. Advanced reservation is essential as the places gets crowded quick..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeF96dmlnRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Usually order take-away but decided to dine in this time instead. Prata was excellent - freshly made and was perfectly crispy and chewy, one of the best I’ve had! The briyani never disappoints. Rice was flavourful and meat was tender. Keep it up!"

Will return to try more"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc3A2SXB3RRAB,Semma Singapore,5,This restaurant keeps improving. The owner provides very good service. It's one of my family's favorite place for prata now.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a3QyVG13RRAB,Semma Singapore,4,"Clean and neat Indian restaurant near spring leaf nature park. The coin prata was one of the best we had recently. They also serve different variety of thosai. The oothappam we had was good. Overall good selection if you are a meat and fish lover.

Exceptionally clean and good service"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeEw2R1JREAE,Semma Singapore,5,"The food had always been the best. It was always been a great pleasure dine in, takeaway or been catered. Rahim have never failed to ensure we leave with a smile. I am 101% glad with the fingerlicking sedap food and ambience created by the staffs there. Kudos to all of you for giving us a different level of flavours without coloring added."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MWZUNFB3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,Friendly staff and tasty food. Great place for family or friends
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjck1HUmx3RRAB,Semma Singapore,5,Real awesome Indian comfort food! Definitely one of my new favourite Indian restaurants! Great flavour with just the right kick of spiciness. Must try the mutton briyani...damn happening! Highly recommend!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMWJya3VBRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Very kind uncle serving us ✌🏿the plain Prata alone, with special fluffy texture  is worth our trip to here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdC11Vm1RRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"excellent delicious indian food, also very value for money !
i LOVE their coin prata, and their veggie sides are a must try"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpczdXNVp3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Seems like a regular weekend place for my family. My kids love this place. Simple place but great food. Their ""Thosai"" has gone a step higher in taste. Very good service by all of their staffs especially Mr. Rahim (hope I got his name right). My family of 6 are so routined that he knows exactly what we want. All the dishes are great and served hot. Prices are also easy on the wallet. Whenever I ask my kids for a dining place, the first place that come s is Tasha ...""kudos"" to your team."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjaTRTSlh3EAE,Semma Singapore,5,"Went with my family just before the lockdown and tried their chicken and mutton briyani, and chicken murtabak. Best I ever tried!

The mutton was so tender that it kinds of ""melt in the mouth"". The flavour of the rice was made just right (does not have that overwhelming spice taste). When the mutton, rice and gravy were eaten together, it gave a homely and familar feeling which is satisfying.

The chicken briyani was good as well. The chicken meat was tender and not dry.

The chicken murtabak had a special taste. It was slightly cripsy on the outside and had a slight lingering sweet taste. I like it!

It was an air-conditioned and nice place. The kitchen was properly separated from the dining area so my clothes didn't have that food smell or feel after the meal.

The individual serving size was adequate and will satisfy the general population.

Would really like to try how their pratas as well if I had more stomach capacity but will definitely visit them again (when the situation allows it)!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2OGZyamxRRRAB,Semma Singapore,4,Tasted the cheese prata with teh halia Ice. Superb nicely tasting food. Only reason I'm not giving 5 star cause I thought it's halal but they sell alcohol so by the time I realise too late. So Muslim friends just take note ya. Unless u don't mind the food is great.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bnA2THRBRRAB,Semma Singapore,5,"Went with my family and friends and we had a great dining experience at Tasha’s! The staff were very patient and helpful. The Mee goreng Ayam, Nasi goreng Ikan Bilis, Nasi Goreng egg, Chicken Murtabak we ordered were exceptionally delicious! Will definitely come back to try more soon! Thanks for the great food!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMEozczRBRRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,2,"It's my 1st visit to this restaurant to try there menu .. the food was good and tasty and i liked it but the waiting time omg It's takes time, if you go to this restaurant and you're so hungry you'll not be happy because you need to wait about 15 minutes i guess."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPOW9teVZREAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,"Nice environment to dine in, cheap and good. Compare to other Indian restaurant, this one is cheapest. Friendly staff, can go and try thier set menu, super worth it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2NhUk5nEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,2,"They don't serve thosai at any time of the day, only briyani, naan, rice sets. No prata either.

Vegetarian rice set - the ingredients were little and the vadai was small. I could get something similar for less than half the price outside. Would go to komala villa nearby instead.

Service was fine."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHB6Z0NBEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,"Mutton Biryani is very tasty. I was lucky, didnt experience bad attitude or bad service. Ordered from the nice Indian man who was managing the food."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPeDRySDhRRRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,"It’s newly opened. Not all the items in the menu are available e.g thosa. Hope it will catch-up soon.
All the dishes are up to the standard and tasty.
But bit disappointed with the masala tea😏
Other Shakinthala’s branches have set high standard for masala tea😃"

Taste good for me. The price not so cheap but not so expensive either. However, the parking lot a bit far to reach this shop otherwise u come by public transport."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cU5QMVNBEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,1,"They dont serve Thosai varieties, idli, rava, chapati etc. They have naan (was nice) and paal appam (total disaster - thick and flat - flour did not rise). We ordered our favorite Hot Badam Milk and we were served with a cup of diluted condensed milk with few sprinkle of badam. Very disappointing. Tasted horrible. I clarified with the waiter on this. He said they use condensed milk and not fresh milk. I returned the badam milk, but was still charged for it. Spent $46.20. Receipt No. YSN12364. Charged $3.20 for batham milk. We will never go to that place ever."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cGJURlhnEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,2,"We have Ordered naan and roti items with Panner makhani, pepper mutton, kudal masala. Not worth for money.

Pepper mutton more oily and salty
Kudal masala over salty
Panner makhani also average taste.
Overall not good dinner experience and taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNla29XZWpRRRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,1,"Ordered  few butter naan, ordered some curry that I wanted on the menu. Whatever I ask all don’t have.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MHNiY1Z3EAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,2,Had lunch but masala mutton I had was really salty. Price is a bit high compared to other Indian restaurants that do similar menu..service staff was not great as well
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ3BlLWxRRRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,1,"Menu items were limited, small portion, food was cold, pricey but the venue was cosy. I prefer the outlet in tekka, at least the customer service is good there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX29DWnJ3RRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,1,"Avoid at all cost! Whatever you ask for, they wouldn’t have. Whatever they have, you wouldn’t want to have it as it is that bad. None of the meat had any taste to it. I believe they were prepared separately and then just thrown into the gravy and masala. Was deceived by the big brand name Sakunthalas. On the bright side , the vegetarian meal and Briyani rice was edible."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPN2NhSkFnEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,"Friendly staffs and comfortable place to dine in.
First time eating ponni rice and the taste is really different from those Thai rice.
The mutton masala set was delicious, love the gravy 😋.
The paneer in tomato👌.
Tandoori chicken briyani was ok....for me the briyani rice was a bit overpowered by spices. Tried the masala tea, it was good but a bit sweet.( forgot to ask for less sugar).
The fish head curry was a disappointment though. I've had better at other eatery"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaXZ5V3F3RRAB,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,1,"The service was super terrible. Our first and last time here. We won’t go back again!

There was literally only 5 tables occupied. So I don’t know why we had to wait so long to place order.

1) waited 20 mins for ppl to take orders. The lady taking the order is rude and arrogant.

2) the lady at the cashier counter. My goodness.. super blur and slow… she cannot grasp any infor and we hv to repeat many times to her:

3) the india brothers were efficient and better than e two ladies who were front line.. seriously cmi..

4) After eating main course; we ordered payasam and tea. We Waited another 20 mins. We CAncelled the order; paid and left:

With the current issues of food positioning from Sakunthala’s making rounds in Tik Tok.. we still wanted to support and so came to Sakunthala’s.. forget it.. Their service is Soo bad that I won’t come back at all."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyajZfNVRBEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,"Great new place. Food is delicious with reasonable prices. Has a bit of a homestyle feel with relaxed but friendly service.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURleEotSExnEAE,Sakunthala’s Restaurant,4,Happy to see a proper south Indian style restaurant at  Yishun area. Tried  and standard taste as in other outlets. Got good number of options to try. Good price  that matches the quality and quantity. Restaurant is overcrowded during weekends and public holidays. so there will be a waiting time. Plan accordingly. Overall good experience. Good Ambience and service.  Will visit again.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyNnRTTlZBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Always a great food experience here. Coin prata nice and crispy. Mutton bryani was tender and flavourful. The sweet lassi was good as well.

This prata shop is definitely much better than the one at Jalan Kayu. Might be abit out of the way but worth it! Prices about $10 per pax with drinks depending on what you eat."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNzVlT0NnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Good prata! Very crispy. Even the egg prata was super crispy. The curry was not as good as the prata. I asked for fish curry, but this is not the spicy type. Maybe I prefer those with spicier taste. Since it’s my first time visiting his branch, I was quite surprise to see people queuing outside the shop before it opens at 8am. A place cyclists will frequent due to the location."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc09UeWl3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,"Wasn’t very impressed. Service Staff seemed impatient, and were unknowledgeable about the food they were serving.

Had their Special Lamb Briyani too, but it was very underwhelming. It’s mostly bone. Maggi Goreng was terrible bland, almost like it’s just been cooked in water and drained.

Their Plain Prata was crispy, as promised. Plaster Blaster and Umami 50 were some interestingly delicious items.

The ingredients for Murtabak were not scattered evenly, so it was quite confusing with each bite.

Other than that, just a over hyped, and expensive place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbFlDVzl3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,"After all the fuss about how good their prata is, we decided to pay a visit. Crispy yes, but is it that nice? Nope. Paying $2.40 for 1 egg prata is not worth it, plus it was super oily. As for the maggi goreng chicken, paying $6.60 for some simple tossed noodles is ridiculous. I would give $3.50 max. Finding the parking space was another headache. Maybe my fellow Singaporeans want an aircon place to relax and chit chat. Even that should be avoided since it is covid times. Conclusion, just not worth it. Ask me and I can suggest other neighbourhood uncles selling superb tasting pratas and maggi goreng."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOWU3WkxBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"A must-go place for delicious prata! Must try for their unique prata and their prata curry. Highly recommend Prata Alfredo if you love cheese and the plaster blaster. The salted egg prata is not to my liking, it doesn’t taste like salted egg."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaGZDSFhnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"3/6/22
Crispy! Reasonable Price!

Ordered Egg Prata, Coin Prata, Ghee Thosai , & Butter Chicken.
But wish that the Coin Prata can crispier.
The Thosai sauces so so only, neighborhood taste compared to Little India."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeTVhalhBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"What we ordered:
Onion Cheese Prata
Plaster
Egg prata
Coin prata
Dessert Prata (Red bean)
Bandung

What we will come back for:
Onion Cheese Prata
Egg prata
Try a few more of their unique flavours

Pro tip:
Go on fave and buy their e-voucher. You pay $27 for $30 credits. Save $3! 😁

Their shop is relatively small even with outside seats I would say the place can only take a max of perhaps 40-50 people with safe distancing etc.

Thankfully we arrived before the dinner crowd and managed to snag seats in the air conditioned area. We got the side seats by the wall and the seats are essentially just concrete. Quite uncomfortable honestly.

The drinks came rather quickly and then soon most of the other pratas started being served up. They also provide curry as seen in the picture for free. If you want sugar with your prata you can also ask them to pass a bottle to you. In essence service here is pretty good even though they are extremely busy.

The onion cheese prata and the egg prata was excellent. Super crispy and tasty as well. Would highly recommend!

The plaster was quite meh to me and the dessert prata is similar to the chinese red bean pancake you have in restaurants except its much sweeter and also the red bean is not as fine and fragrant. I would give this a miss the next time.

Bandung is ok. Big cup is sizeable but because we make our own bandung at home we prefer it more gao with more carnation milk and syrup. This was a tad bit diluted for me.

By the time we completed our entire meal plus drinks our coin prata had not been served. Not only ours but the tables close to us as well. We thought good things are worth the wait... right? Wrong! We totally disliked the coin prata and ended up not finishing it. It was so thick and so much flour even though it was crispy it was just too floury for our liking.

Will we come back? Definitely! This place is right beside Springleaf MRT along TEL MRT line. See how I rated them on the individual components.

Food 2/5
Ambience 2/5
Overall 2/5

Price does not reflect the quality of food.

Had their egg and plain prata. Flour wasn't any more flavourful than usual prata from other places, tasted like an average prata. The egg prata was freshly made and crispy while the plain prata was cold and soggy.

Curry was creamy and mildly spicy.

Had the teh halia, but it tasted more like normal teh. The ginger scent was barely there unless you focus and try your best to taste the ginger.

Place appears run-down and quite dark on the inside. There is also poor phone reception despite them offering favepay as an option. Took me about 2 minutes to complete the payment due to poor reception.

Overall, wouldn't recommend trying at all. Suggest giving this place a pass."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNk5LaWpRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"The restaurant opened at 8am sharp while the queue is forming. Pretty fast in serving but missed to deliver fully on my order, which is fine as they quickly rectified it. Prata is supper crispy. Coffee and teh tarik a little diluted to our liking. Besides being more oily the overall taste of the prata is great! Btw one of my friend spotted a cockroach running across the seats."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1c3UtSDdBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,"Always loved springleaf! Patronised the ones in the West. And first time trying this. The food quality is bad. The mee goreng didn’t taste a tiny bit like how it should be. And the egg Prata was mehhh. This was totally not the standard it should be. The noodle was so bad that we poured fish curry over it to give it some flavour as it was very bland. Would not recommend this outlet.

the location here is very convenient."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtbFpfbFdBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"My brother visiting SG from California found this ""wafer thin crispy prata"" place in social media. Was there about 11.30 am on a weekday morning to beat the lunch time crowd. Just look at the long stretched prata which has a scrambled egg wrapped in it. The standard plain prata is squarish in shape. Crispy skin with a little soft texture inside. Goes well with the fish curry sauce. Kids would love to bite off the crispy prata skin.

One would think this branch in Upper Thomson is ulu (remote) and not many people would eat there. Not true. The recently opened Springleaf MRT station is smack in front of the row of cafes, restaurants, Ampang KL yong tau foo and where Springleaf Prata is. The eateries there including hardware stores, vehicle repair shops and mini groceries have struck lottery with this saver MRT station.

On another early lunch time, my brother and I had Yong tau foo. We saw one diner at another table enjoying his kuay chap and soy sauce braised boneless duck meat. Looked yummy to pass. We ordered the same to whet our appetite. The boneless duck meat was tender and salt level, not too salty was acceptable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMExfSHNRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Pratas were made fresh, and crispy. The fish curry was thick, savoury, tangy and very satisfying. Also, would recommend the soursop drink, very nice. Come here for the good pratas."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNlBTajJRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"We had the Egg Prata, Egg+Cheese Prata, Plain Prata, and Paper Prata with Sugar. We liked all, except the egg+cheese prata which was slightly salty! The pratas in general were crispy which was great. We preferred the fish curry to the chicken curry, although it was slightly spicier, which some might not appreciate. Affordable prices as always!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHJ2Z2l3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"I visited on Saturday around 6pm and the place was packed. The food came about 15 minutes after ordering. Overall the pratas were good compared to coffeeshop standards, the only complaint I have is that some part of the prata is hard(like a biscuit).

Service of the staff not so good, they just put the dish on the table quickly and dropped the utensils on the plate and left quickly... Ur staff could have just placed it nicely instead of dropping the utensils on the plate."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlOEozQ0pBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,The prata is crispy and made fresh when you order. Great selection of prata but the tea  halia and mango lassi is disappointing.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcEp5aDBBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Been coming to this place for more than 9 years and clocked more than 700 visits.
The original staff and cashier are no longer here, but the taste of the food is still up to standard, unlike other branches where it can be inconsistent.
Only small issue of teh tarik ICED tastes too diluted. Recommend to drink hot beverages if you can help it.
I will personally recommend the sugar and milk paper prata, egg prata and sambal chicken.
If you like floss, then can go for their umami prata and other specialty pratas like the sg50 prata.
Now very convenient to come here since springleaf mrt station is just 2 mins walk."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNzlYaTJ3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"The location is now easily accessible by TEL Line. The Prata Blaster tasted great for someone who tries it out for the first time. On subsequent visits, it tasted a bit overwhelming for me. Decent pricing. A general go-to place to have Prata with family and friends."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb042UXpRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Visited this original outlet for the first time with my partner. Pleasantly surprised by the selection available, especially the yearly favourites. Service was pretty fast too.

We ordered a beehoon goreng, mozzarella cheese prata, plaster blaster and Däs Prätwürst with 2 teh tarik. OMG everything here was super tasty. Crispy prata with nice ratio of cheese to prata. The plaster had good eggs Benedict too and the sausage prata was a nice twist to currywurst!!

The beehoon was also moist with nice sized chicken bits and egg (meat and egg are add-on charge). Very pleasant meal. The curry for the prata was also rich, right spiciness and flavourful. Made all the prata stood out too!

Will be back for other pratas they have!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtZzdtcFFBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Eatery serving traditional pratas and also pratas with a nice twist. The salted egg & prawn murtabak is a must try! The portion size for their murtabak is huge. We ordered the mini size for 2 murtabak, prata coins (5 mini plain pratas), mutton curry and drinks, and we (3 pax) can barely finish it. Definitely a great place for a hearty breakfast or supper."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXN19pNGtnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,Great food let down by below par or disinterested service. Wrong order fulfillment is common.  Ordered egg prata n got cheese prata instead.

Honestly was super crowded to visit on a PH, but managed to quickly get seats upon arrival as people seem to eat rather quickly here"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtMVBUeXpRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Totally awesome place to go for Prata. Conveniently located at Springleaf TEL, exit 2.
The plain prata is so good. If you like crispy prata, you have to try their cheese prata.
Also tried their Sugar Paper which was so crispy, thin and good. We couldn't get enough and ordered another one.
HIGHLY Recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaXRidHpnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,So yummy! They're really creative with their menu items. I'm so glad I tried them out. The photo is for Plaster Blaster. Their take on eggs benedict. Really yummy! 😁😁😁
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNFBhcjRnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,Quite a crowd when family visited on Monday morning. Although we can find seat rather quickly. The prata is ok for some of us and excellent for those who like crispy version. Ordered the plaster blaster. Quite nice if you eat together with the sweet prata
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2eHZIMmpnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"Went there during lunch time and I was a bit disappointed with the food. I ordered the plaster blaster, prata Alfredo and Iced Teh Tarik. The plaster blaster was a disaster, I ate there multiple times and this time was the worst. The prata was cold and the taste just don't mixed well especially with a cold prata. The prata Alfredo however taste much more delicious and filled with cheese and every bite is so good. Just make you want to keep eating. But to end off, the Iced Teh Tarik was so diluted that drinking plain water was much better. Overall the food service kinda of dropped, maybe it is due to the lack of manpower and proper management but the food is suppose to be unique and delicious. Hope it will improve over time again to be back to where it was previously."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTlELWZnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Good Taste and Price.
Payment only Cash & NETS. Credit Card payment is Not Accepted."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2ekxIZnZnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,The ultimate prata series are savoury. This is the to-go place if you are looking for creative creation of prata dishes. Would have given a 5 stars if not for the long wait (mostly due to slow customers turnover for dining in) and the gap in service (table not cleaned thoroughly).
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxbjhhZ3hBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,Surprisingly good for all the special version Prata. They gave tons of cheese inside. A little bit regret order three of them for two person. Didn't think they have so much cheese. But the flavour is good. Definitely should give it a try.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdzhUMzhnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"The salted egg Prata is something you seldom find else where

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGIzT25RRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,The prata is crispy and delicious. Did not quite enjoy the meeting goreng. Usually a queue to get in but moves fast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHakpLajF3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"This outlet is less busy than the other one i typically visit at bukit timah. They serve the prata and curry rather than having to self service.  No service charge. The portion is good size. My spouse and i redeemed lazada vouchers with ease. Is a good deal with the vouchers. Satisfying singaporean style breakfast. Sinfully Gratifying. The egg prata is huge, delicious and crispy like a biscuit."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhXzZ2QmJREAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,My to go to prata place when ever I have cravings for nice yummy crispy prata! Have been patronizing this shop for almost 7 years and they have maintained their food standards! Mr Sarsi has always been very polite and friendly towards us but it seems like he’s not working there anymore 🥲
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHbTUtdTJ3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"We actually already had lunch but since we were around the area we had to stop by here anyway. Was last here before Springleaf was awarded Michelin guide! Surprised and glad to see the pratas are still really good quality and the fish curry they serve too. We had the premium egg floss prata which was a little over $5, though it's not the cheapest prata but the portions was huge and servings of the curry was amazing and of course unlimited. Definitely will be back again and again (to other outlets as well of course!)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2emVMYmFREAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"Came today at around 5pm as this is still my niece favourite Prata hotspot. Same usual issue of tables and chairs uncleaned, oily spots on table and crumbs on chairs. They have changes in ordering as now drinks have size difference which was not highlighted upon ordering. All drinks came in large sizes and as from the images below, my niece can't even finish the super large ice Milo. Personally felt that cashier should highlight to customer when ordering and not by default assuming we want largest size. Food aspect is simple, ordered Kosong/Egg Prata won't go wrong and that's the main reason for bringing my family back. Damage was $30++ for 5 Kosong, 3 Eggs, 1 Mutabak and 3 large drinks."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bzU2dWJnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,Pretty long queue but the waiting time wasn't very long. Quickly ordered the food but took quite a long time to serve instead. Food was pretty decent and pratas were crispy. Ordered butter chicken but didn't expect for a full chicken thigh. The highlight and the recommended dish to order has to be the special salted egg prawn prata. So good it felt like was eating a thin crust pizza. The most expensive items ordered but well worth the price. Had a good mix of sweet and savoury pratas.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbnBPaGpBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,1,Hi...are you planning to take the tel line to explore this place or cycling past as I was? I'm flabbergasted by the reviews here. The masala thosai I ordered (chef's recommendation) was extremely poor. Sorry for the half eaten picture(as I was starving) but you can see from the pic the potatoes were so poor. The coffee was extremely watery too despite the change. What about the other chef recommendations? I'm just so shocked the standards have dropped.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyZ2N6aER3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,Pretty decent and crispy prata. Just that the curry was abit too watery. A little pricey but it was still ok.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybk9fd1JnEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,Prata gravy is special and nice. Fried Maggie not bad too. Beverages like teh tarik & kopi tarik is good too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMzktU1p3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"Excited with the idea of being able to explore Springleaf with the new MRT Brown line, I headed over to Springleaf Prata Place to try their paper thosai and cheese prata. We ordered our drinks, Kopi ice and Teh ice, and were surprisingly pleased by it. They were perfect, unlike what the other reviews might imply. Here's a tip : If the drink has bubbles on top, it's probably good :)

My partner had her Mozz.Cheese prata and it was jampackedddd with cheese, better than any other places I can think of in Singapore. Curry was thick but not spicy, so I guess there's a negative there.

So far, if my experience had ended here, I'd give this place a 5/5. Then I had a bite of my paper thosai.

Thosai was crispy, but only because the thin parts were burnt and bitter! Thicker areas as so thick because the batter was scrapped off. The mouth feel was practically too chewy like gum or too crumbly like sand!

To make it worse, the dhaal and chutney was especially thin and flavourless. Spent so much time scrapping the bottom to pick up more bits within the watery gravy, I felt like I was fishing 🎣🎣🎣🎣 🐟🐟🐟

In spite of this, I admit lah, maybe their batter wasn't good that day or they had a bad day in the kitchen. Still, to this day, the worst thosai I've had and I've had a lott of thosai. My tastebuds were disappointed and hurt, even their plaster prata cannot cover my disappointment.

TLDR: Come here for their prata and their prata only."

Their pratas are always sweet, eggy and delicious, their curries a mild spicy, sweet, milky and full of flavour, their murtaburger is the bomb, their tandoori chicken murtabaks are always juicy and never dry, their poached egg hollandaise sauce and ham combo is delicious, their portobello mushroom and mozzarella cheese pratas defy all expectations while their briyani is soft, dripping with a melt in your mouth lamb shank.

If you don't have a quirk for crispy pratas, or a preference for spicy curries and just don't know where to go - this place has the quality and variety down pat. Their kopi cinos and the cinos are super yummy too."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bUtLTXp3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Tried the plain prata and egg with onion prata. Pretty crisp and good. But long queue on a Saturday, came around 0950 and we had to queue for 15-20 mins before getting a table. Once inside, the order came after 10 mins. Overall decent experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbDdDYmxnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Very fast and quick service.
The sambal is really good with a good spice in it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbXFIR2hBRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"Doesn't matter how nice the food are, am a person that prefers good treatment than your skills. Some of the staff here always react like as if our presence are bothering them. Work on your manners. The way you treat others and your surroundings is way more important than what skills/capabilities you have."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbmI2NndRRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,4,"Hot, fresh and crispy prata in a breezy morning. love this branch because the surronding area is so tranquil"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNE11ZUZBEAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"I did not know that the sausage egg prata had cheese in it and I am lactose intolerant. I went to the manager and told him my dilemma, he was very nice to make fresh ones for me without cheese. Really grateful for the manager to go out of his way to replace it for me free.

Highly recommend to dine here for prata or supper. :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dnRPWnp3RRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,So so... Egg prata is big on surface area... But thin. MyBriyani House and even my nearby prata is better.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxak1yR09REAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"Reno is a bit old but basic cleanliness is acceptable.
Food is quite nice & prata is more of a crispy texture.
The curries are quite salty to personal liking..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyM01fcVd3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,2,"Lack of hygiene in this place. The new plates that were placed on the table were so still so oily. Shows that they were washed properly. Secondly, most plates were dented and not presentable at all. Service was very slow. Prata was really good. 2 tried two types of briyani. Both were equally terrible. Prawn of not fresh a all.
Ventilation of very bad in that shop. The place were they dumped all the leftover food was so unsightly and unhygienic just the sink were we wash hands. Walking pass there made us want to throw up. Please review the hygiene practices in your shop . Thank you"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MEppanZnRRAB,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,3,"The last time l went to Springleaf Prata was 7 to 8 years ago. The place has been spruced up. It's brighter, airier, cleaner and feel more spacious. The best part is it no longer smell heavily of curry and oil which stick to your clothes and hair.

Unfortunately, the standard of the food has gone southwards. We ordered a number of stuffs, from prata to murtabak to maggi goreng to nasi biryani. Only the prata withstood the taste test. The rest left much to be desired. The maggi goreng lacks 'wok hei' and the chicken meat in wre all dry and rubbery.  The meat in the murtabak is quite bland, so overall the dish lacks oomph and flavour. The mutton nasi biryani was very average. I've tasted better ones even in neighbourhood coffee shops.

While the self service curry gravy seems like a good idea, the gravy offered here are a bit too watery and not flavorful enough."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MHN2bER3EAE,Springleaf Prata Place - Thongsoon,5,"Absolutely huge range of pratas and specialty creations available. I've visited them many times at their Springleaf and Rail Mall outlets, and have found something new to try every time. The Murtaburger is highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc0w3ZG1RRRAB,Indian Vegiterian,4,"Polite cashier who took the order. Nice gravy comes with freshly made dosa. Masala tea is nice unlike some too sweet. Overall v good experience.  Well done, good job!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPaktqa2VnEAE,Indian Vegiterian,3,Generous portion but waiting time is super long. Mee goreng is salty. Dosa is ok.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydHJlUHNRRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Located along the low storey shop houses along Sembawang road, next to Euphony Gardens Condo. Public parking is available just outside the place but can be tough to get a lot on weekend meal times.

One of family’s favourite place for Indian food, having eaten or taken out on multiple occasions. Many great items here with standouts been the masala chicken, crab masala and curry fish head. Dum briyani are available on Saturdays but you have to early as they are mostly sold out by 2pm. Rice here used are the basmati type for both the plain and briyani, liked that their briyani is lightly coloured and contains cashew as well. The variety of Indian bread is pretty good here, great for those likes to mix and match.

Service can be a little stretched at busy hours for dine in, just have to be patient and will not be disappointed with a little waiting."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdy1tcEZ3EAE,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"First time trying, ordered take away - the special of the day, Mutton Dum Briyani, cauliflower and papadom. Paid SGD21.60. Busy during weekend lunch time but was served shortly. They also have the counter which is like the mixed rice concept. Q to be served to chose the dish and food. The food still smell good after 15 mins when i reached home. The overall portion is huge however the mutton portion inside is not alot, the rice is alot. Rice is fragrance and tasty. Mutton is tender. Worth a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcGNtOE5REAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"This restaurant greets customers with a strong aroma and  ambience, it's nice a see a crowd again. Today it was  a sure delight to discover a giant prawn... Larger then my fingers.. So tasty with Britani and veggies."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtMkp1cTRRRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,3,I tried the mutton rendang. The rice itself wasn’t that fragrant. Ingredient and spices were limited. The curry dip was disappointing. Almost no taste. Vegetables were bland too. Only saving the grace was the mutton. It was tasty with a heavy dose of thick yoghurt. Teh tarik is not bad too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ1AydVVBEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,3,"Lovely fluffy rice, fish curry lacked kick...veg was ok. Masala tea a mite sweet.Restaurant ambience comfortable. 45 mins stated for 'eating time'but be mindful you may not have your meal served for 10 mins. Staff look like they mean business...Not a bad lunch but for SGD 13......Halal of course..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMzlTTXVnRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Nice food, reasonable price.

Super love their food, my kids love it too. Kids eat prata, eat in, the prata is super crispy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtaWRuRXdBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,4,wenr arnd lunch time.. wait arnd 5-10 for our orders to be taken as they are busy. Prata is very delicious. Came w curry and daal. theres a small mutton fats w it. curry is spicy 👌. The teh ais is sweet to my liking. Just the food is on the slightly expensive side. Overall a pleasant experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXeU1PdG53RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Always delicious — same excellent taste since 25 years ago when I started patronizing their food court stall at Northpoint. Their Chicken Biryani is my absolute favorite!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbk9qUmJREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,4,Amazing briyani. I am completely taken by surprise. This is the closest India Indian food I can find in Singapore. Friends from southern India will love this place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOWNQMmp3RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"Cycled here, the chicken looks very huge which could be quite daunting. But it tastes good!
The lime juice is very refreshing as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyM3R5ZU5BEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"So. Freaking. Good. Chicken masala, butter chicken, and I forgot what else, all of them tasted great. Love the garlic naan too. Hands down one of the best indian food I've tried in Singapore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxdDgtOC1BRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"Nice Indian food. Particular love the potato cutlet, mutton and their dhal. However do note that they will close their kitchen from 3.00 to 5.30pm and between that period can only order from the counter. Do note your visit timing to avoid disappointment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMXAtV25RRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"Very nice light Indian meal. This restaurant is  easy on the palette and makes sure their dishes are not overly spiced up. The flavours are there, briyani Rice is consistent, fluffy and flavoured. I would say for my liking it was pretty good yet lacked a slight Umph for  a South Indian Spicy food foodie like my Family. However, I would give it a thumbs up and 4 stars for service, consistency and taste."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPek5UdG9BRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"As usual basmati rice briyani but I miss Dum briyani every time I visited..
Nice ambiance and good place to visit with family..

Finally I visited recently and tasted the Authentic Dum Briyanai. Really tastes good and Must try it."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1akpTLTBnRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Crowded during weekdays lunch time but tables are cleared quickly
I ordered briyani vegetarian set meal
Very freshly cooked and delicious
Good polite services 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleXVDNXZBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Visited them almost every week over the last couple of years, but recently moved out of the North West area and so haven't had the time to pop by, but we definitely remembered them when it came to our catering choice for our housewarming. And they sure didn't dissapoint. Some of our guests even asked for their contact details. Definitely top notch food and always consistent too!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPb3RtWUJnEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"Would rate zero stars if I could. Went there with family and there was this one particular staff who was incredibly rude and by yelling ""Wait"" when we raised our hand for her attention. When we ordered our food, she messed our order up 2 times. We completely understand if an establishment is understaffed. But rudeness cannot be tolerated regardless. We were very specific about our orders and even repeated it twice. Both times. They still gave us the wrong order and even walked away without even apologising. Absolutely, ridiculous and unacceptable! Will not recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMkl1YmpBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Tried with my colleauges. The food was tasty with very reasonable price.
Fish head curry and Tandori chicken tasted great. Overall the portion served was great and value for money.

Customer service was very pleasant."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMnYzZ2hBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Food is good and place is clean, staff very good and attentive. Food price on high side but its worth paying. Easy parking just opp thr shop. Keep it up"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLNzg2ZURREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"Great food - tried out most of these dishes for the first time and we loved the taste of spices. The curries were well flavored and spiced. The grilled pineapples were something we haven tried before and it was good although we had to wait 20 mins for it. The boneless mutton curry was well flavour but part of the meat were pretty tough to chew on - it would have been 5 stars if the meat had been more tender. The chicken dum briyana was good and infused with the aroma of spices.  Overall, a positive dining experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcjRmOGhBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"Just went on a sunday evening with my family of 5. We ordered 2 plain naan and 1 garlic naan, one poori set, one butter chicken, one tofu sambal among a few other things. The naans came first and it was 1 butter naan and 2 garlic naan. As it was quite busy we just let it go but after most of the other food arrived, the butter chicken for the naan still havnt arrived and whatever naans that were left (we started eating cos we were so hungry) was turning cold and hard! It was after 3 to 4 times we asked them to check on our butter chicken that it finally came, a measly 3 piece in a less than 10 cm diameter flat dish! Service was atrocious but we understand it could be due to busy crowd but at least be apologetic and learn to serve the curry and butter chicken first before the naans, otherwise, how do we eat it plain without them?? Plus, the naans have turned cold and hard by then! Not to say the dishes were priced 10$ and above for a pathetic portion and tastes were also all salty! We will never patronise this place again! Only patronise this place if you enjoy lousy service, high pricing for ridiculously small portion and awful tasting food!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTNjQtdkh3EAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Easily the best chicken Briyani I have had in Singapore. The mutton and fish curry is especially tasty. A great find near Sembawang and we will be sure to come back again! Absolutely delicious and great dining experience.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OV8tRGNBEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Food was so good & delicious I would say. Price also very reasonable. Good service
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eXJPa0x3EAE,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"Paid $9.50 for chicken Bryani and the size of the breast meat was half the size of what it was. It was ridiculous and totally unacceptable to be given a miserable chicken fillet looking portion! We have been their regular so we knew the portion very well and we’d alway ask for breast meat in which he argued it was thigh.  While we can understand inflation has shrunk the chicken portion but the Chinese man cashier was so lamely defensive that to say that all their chicken breast meat were the same size, all along looking like fillet size. Hey, anyone who has a decent eyesight could tell the difference between a chicken quarter white (breast meat with wing attached) vs a slab of chicken fillet. He was so rude to outrightly challenged me to validate his claim. I asked the Indian lady server to pick another piece of a decent to prove him wrong that there were bigger piece! Pl don’t take advantage of consumer by being such a bully.  They should weigh the portion instead of offending customer.
I was to upset to take the photo before they unwilling changed to the bigger piece I chose. They also  threw the smaller fillet looking piece right before my eye!

@North point foodcourt"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbTZ2bEhnEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,4,"The basmati rice is not really up to standard anymore, but overall I feel that it is a good place for the usual fish curry meanl"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzOE5DaTJnRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"Fantastic place with good food!
Had the garlic naan and naan with butter chicken. They have a wide variety of food and beverages, Briyani was a very big portion, so if you are really hungry, go for it!
Can’t wait to come back!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzOExEZ0lREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Delicious food! I always get the butter chicken and naan here. They used to take your order at the table but now it seems like everyone orders their food at the counter. The food has always been a similar standard since I first started coming here. Spent quite a lot this time.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJME5uUDJnRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,2,Decent Indian food but a few peculiarities like minimum order of 2 crabs is a must at $14 each and complementary veggies with the rice is given free only once in small portions. There was potential but totally turned off by the way they do business.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlME1hQWF3EAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Wonderful non veg food and cheap
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cjhycGhBRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"Cashier staff today (9th Aug) had a subpar attitude. I paid using paywave and it did not go through the first time (machine fault or sth) bc the second time I used the same card for the transaction it went through. Cashier felt the need to announce loudly that my card was not working after the first failed transaction, whatever. During the second time I paid using the same card and the transaction went through (machine showed approved but cashier wasn’t looking) but right as the transaction went through, there was a power outage throughout the restaurant (second time within 20 mins btw). After the power came back on, cashier told me to tap my card again and I informed her the transaction already went through. I showed her that I already have a payment made to the restaurant (via my GRAB app), she kept saying it didn’t show up on her machine so I need to pay again. The fact that there was no transaction shown on the machine wasn’t her fault but her attitude was really terrible to be in customer service, she didn’t bother explaining or try to be empathetic. As a customer I already paid so obviously I wasn’t keen to pay twice and have to wait for one of the payments to be refunded to me. She took down my name and number and said she will contact her bank to refund the payment to me so I’ll need to keep an eye out for that. Could train your staff to be better at having some empathy or just have better customer service :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlamFyWE1nEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Great place for briyani lovers at the North. The Boss and lady Boss are very friendly and accomodating. A must try!!!

Nothing special, the mutton is really small.
Feel that the spice and fragrance is missing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bDZhNXR3RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Tried my first podi thosai here. Super delicious! Also had the curry fish which was scrumptious! Wait staff were friendly too. Will be coming back!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNktxeUJ3EAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Amazing food as always. The variety and quality of food never fails to amaze our family. Excellent customer service even during peak hours. Keep up the great work!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4dDhldW93RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,"I love this place! I have been patronising them from 2010 when they were in Northpoint shopping mall Kopitiam. They have been quite consistent with their food quality. Their briyani rice fragrant and the gravies flavour bomb, i Favour the boneless mutton briyani with fish cutlet. Yum. my husband likes their chicken briyani. I would be happy if they can do island wide delivery. It’s troublesome to order now from them."

Their soya, Tahu sambal & potato are the best!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaWFPYVlREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,4,Was craving for briyani the other day and found this plc after some googling. I personally love the chicken briyani. Mutton's one was good as well. Pricing is alright. Service was good.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpLUpuN29RRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Chicken Briyani was super awesome. Friendly staffs and was quickly served. I have been craving for a good Indian food for awhile and this has satisfied my tummy
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPd182TG1nRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,1,I have been eating Shami for as long as I’ve been residing in Yishun for 20+ years. All i can say imo is they increase prices along the way and inflation is real (which is fine with me as idm paying for good food) but the quality of their product (ie. rice/spices/size of their expensive meat or fishes) is really getting worse. Really disappointing. Today shall be the last time i’m patronizing them at NPC outlet.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dHBuSEdREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"A friend of mine came to Shami Banana for help to use restroom  coz she's not well holding her tummy, looking pale & the lady in the restaurant told her restroom is being clean but my friend saw 2 customers coming out & there's no cleaning done .Such a heartless lady to use such excuse to reject my friend because she's not dinning in .Very disappointing with the staffs too especially those who are serving dishes because I had been there, too"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdXJhZzB3RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,3,Food is nice. But lack customer service. Service is slow and there is no attention to customer needs. Had to wait for a long time to be served. Asked to eat in and they packed.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGR2aklBEAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,After living in India a couple of years it is great to finally find such authentic and wonderful Indian food near Yishun. We'll be back for sure.

Had the chicken biryani and felt the portion is rather small now as compared tp years ago, but I find it is rather suitable now for one person unless you are a heavy eater. There is quite a variety of food here but we didn't try much this time round."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0c2VyV3pRRRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,1,"Waited 20 mins to get rice and ready made dishes which are already available at the counter. Ridiculous service. Four five staff standing behind counter laughing and taking to each other. How long does it take to put something on a plate which is already ready made? The staff move so slow.
There was no banana leaf when we came at 1pm on weekend day, which doesn't make sense since the shop's name is banana leaf. The butter chicken dish was so little with just a few chunks. One vege dish was sgd5, sgd5! Ridiculous pricing ! One small strawberry lassi which was diluted was sgd5.
Tried because of the review. But won't be returning again. Your service is bad, your staff is ridiculously slow, your food is overpriced and just average."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MGQzRTV3RRAB,Shami Banana Leaf,3,Yummy but no napkins and quite pricey. Not a lot of meat in the bryani.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLdHVHWFNREAE,Shami Banana Leaf,5,Great food with good ambience. Will definitely visit again. A portion of nasi briyani is good for 2 people.

We went pretty late at night, was quiet and service was fast.

The staff are friendly and even at late night they go beyond the extra mile to ensure you are comfortable."

Better then waiting there. Waiting time can be a chore as buzzling with Parton all the time.
I can guarantee this is one of the best parata vendor in Singapore. Parata is crispy and curry is superb.  High standard curry.  Fish curry is properly cooked and thiccc..no comment for mutton coz I can't eat mutton.
There's one more Indian Muslim shop at the other end of junction 9. Terrible parata and curry like add hot water only..very watery. No taste.
This Al fattah eatey is highly recommended."

Ikan bilis was crispy and flavorful. Enough veggies and red chillies. Ummmmph. Egg fluffy with yolk runny. Service was quick. Will be back

Six months later. Still my favourite.  But think they raised prices a little. $5 for my bee hoon puteh.

Update 6 Nov 2019:  They have changed to the usual Islamic restaurant mode of cash collection: pay at a dedicated cashier counter. A bit chaotic, tried to charge me for things someone else ordered. And my bee hoon goreng puteh's standard dropped.

Update 9 December 2019: the nasi biryani is good. Mutton soft, well marinated, basmati rice fresh, egg ok. Papadum not crispy anymore and acha so so. Overall good meal at $6.50"

Staff is also very helpful. The plain prata is crispy which is very enjoyable with their fish curry. The egg prata is also crispy which takes away the feeling of the soft center of the egg when biting into the parts.

The teh halia, while having a pleasant strong ginger taste, is a bit too sweet for my taste."

Waiter cum kitchen helper took the cardboard as mat on the floor and after discarding it outside, not only did he not washed his hands, he immediately served the food to the customer even when the outlet was not crowded and the worst part was that he literally didn't even washed his hands again after cleaning his mucus, he continued to serve his customers with their food.

Teh tarik was quite sweet and wife's Maggi goreng was decent but took some time to come. Service was functional and efficient as with your usual mamak shop. Overall, not a bad place to satisfy your prata cravings."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX09qVW1RRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,2,"Ordered prata as I thought the preparation won't take long. However, got to know that they were cleaning the kitchen, which I thought was fair enough, at least they're keeping the place clean. But I don't like the idea of the person cleaning the kitchen to handle the food afterwards. Had to cancel the whole order after waiting for 20 minutes due to the ""kitchen cleaning"". But one of the staff did apologise and refunded the full amount though."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVOS15blVnEAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,3,"Food is good. Especially the prata.
Reasonable cleanliness and staff courteous.
Frequently the food bill amount varies. Regular customers can notice it. Most probably the staff make mistakes while they do mental addition of the amount.
It may be a good idea to put a price listing board on the wall for standard items that customers usually buy. This will reassure the customers."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dXNlNUxREAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,1,Majority of store can’t even understand English. Gets my order wrong 70% of the time. Good food but if they constantly make us pay for the wrong orders then what’s the point.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcHRYZFNREAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,2,Their martabak standard has gone down the drain. It used to be good and thick. Now not much difference from prata fold into two with little mince  mutton thrown in.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NzZ1dW1BRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,3,"Teh Tarik is nice. Kampung fried rice is nice. Nasi Goreng Pattaya is ok, but just a note, the fried rice is the lame type that got chopped carrots and peas. Service is decent."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNd2JDUmxnRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,3,"Convenient place near junction 9 to satisfy my prata cravings. Air conditioned interior augmented with fans made the meal there quite tolerable. Although enclosing the area meant the floor/table tops sometimes were greasy when the cooking got busy.

Had roti prata and teh tarik here. Both were of normal quality. Fish curry that came with it was good!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVd3FqaExBEAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,5,"Nice FD. Crispy hot prata. The other one on same level not nice.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURndlBqVWJBEAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,4,Crispy prata. And I really mean crispy prata. Even the egg prata is crispy.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVbTUtNVpREAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,5,"Prata was good with fish curry. Freshly made when u order.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5d1p2X3d3RRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,5,"Nice food and  reasonable prices, what's there not to patronize?

They are also very proactive to take your orders, unlike some places where they seem to intentionally ignore you because they are onto something else."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4c3JUMFZnEAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,5,"Simply the best. Better than all the rest. A bit more expensive but that's inflation for you. Good chutney. Great with thosai. Although there is no difference between plain, butter, and ghee dosa."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZOHBub21BRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,4,"Ordered by foodpanda. Wanted mushroom cheese thosai but they didn't have it so I opted for mushroom and plain. Also ordered maggi goreng thai but they got my order wrong and swapped it to what seems like nasi goreng seafood. Altho I ordered maggi goreng but still, the nasi goreng was delicious and piping hot. The thosais were nice and the gravies made it much more delicious with the hint of spiciness. Would highly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd0oyMWlRRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,3,The food was ok but the waiting time it can be work it out!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNmRtdDlRRRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,5,"Definitely a must if you're in northern part of Singapore. Not only are the pratas made fresh upon arrival, they also have vegetarian gravy to cater to vegans. Awesome dalcha also"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbEpEYWh3RRAB,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,4,I was initially skeptical about the Thai food here. But my clean empty bowl at the end of my meal should paint a vivid picture to the quality of the food. Nothing more than authentic.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURValB6VURREAE,Al Fatthah Food Expo Restaurant Indian Muslim Food Thai Muslim Seafood,4,Roti prata is fluffy and light with slight crisp on the top and bottoms. Ask for sambal to enhance the flavors
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbXRER1lBEAE,Arabian Nights,4,Briyani was fragrant with lots of spices and herbs. Mutton curry was also good. Worth trying.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dnFhXzRBRRAB,Arabian Nights,4,Plenty of ingredients and feels cleaner than other indian rojak stalls (didnt see any flies). Loved the potato and beancurd. Dipping sauce is served hot and on the sweeter side. $6 for the whole plate.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtaEkyYi13RRAB,Arabian Nights,1,"Just brought a mutton briyani, give me 6pcs of mutton bone with minimum meat attached, very bad, I thought I order mutton bone briyani instead of mutton briyani, also charge $7, I cannot say is expensive but not worth it, because you are eating mutton bone with little bit curry with rice, 1 hard boiled egg & little vegetables, better go to the opposite store, more honestly with the food you pay for."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d05qZ3ZBRRAB,Srisun,5,"Super shiok supper food. Bee Hoon Goreng, not dry and not too wet, justtttt right. Huge portion too, can share for 2 pax."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbXVEU3BnRRAB,Srisun,3,One of my go to places for briyani because they are generous with the rice and meat. Rice is not as fragrant as some other outlets but good enough.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPM3BuT21BRRAB,Srisun,1,If i could give a no star i would...I was standing in front of the man who made the prata and i saw his sweat dropped in the prata he is doing..so gross their cleanliness are the worst I have ever seen.If u guys are there please take a look at their gravy with their kitchen towel was soak with curry and water dripping in the gravy..i couldnt explain more it was soo grossed.There are 5 to 6 people in the shop but their floor was full of rubbish here and there.(please dont give excuses bcos its busy).One guy he open up the rubbish he did not wash his hand he straight away take the prata and serve with his hand not using tongs.Omg seriusly eat at yr own risk..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dHE3WUd3EAE,Srisun,4,Indian/Malay food stall. Still one of the better stalls serving reasonable food. Prata is good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc003RTRRRRAB,Srisun,4,"Prata is not oily with nice fish curry. Beehoon soto is good. Tried the mee rebus, as they ran out of soto, taste is average but a bit salty. Wide selection of items though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBanE3ZGpnRRAB,Srisun,1,Please quit from food panda. Spent 34mins to wait for first order and in the end canceled my order when time's up. Try to order again and spent almost an hour. Again canceled my order. Cannot even done two maggi goreng and one iced nescafe in an hour. Restaurant which received orders but not going to deal with it. Serioulsy suck.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBb2FYS2FBEAE,Srisun,4,Good food and polite smiley staff. Opens 24hour.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURheHVTVjFRRRAB,Srisun,1,Order for delivery through Grab. Msg the driver to make sure that they have give me the correct item which was mutton poori set. They rider reply inform the staff told him all correct is mutton they give. When I receive my order they give me chicken instead of mutton. Why they want to lie to the rider? Dun tell me they dun know what is mutton what is chicken how they look like?
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLaHNualpnEAE,Srisun,1,"Ate here today... Bought 2 normal and 2 butter prata. Couldn't believe it was $9. That's still fine, but the cashier was super rude, and I saw the staff dip his whole finger into the curry!

Super nasty, not coming back again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bC1EZVB3EAE,Srisun,1,Karens rude service available here! No price tag!  Get rude service and mystery prices here!

Then the staff Saw 4 customer Queued in-front of the store .. suddenly my 1 egg 1 plain is ready I ordered before them while they were not busy .. soggy prata just heated awhile .. felt so cheated ruin my Monday morning …"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMjVITlZBEAE,Srisun,1,Not great. And it's more pricey then regular shops. $6.20 for coin prata. Normally we pay $4 max. Royal is also expensive. Taste is so so.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHb0pfc0tBEAE,Srisun,1,"Ordered their prata which was pre-cooked and stored in a container, naturally prata was cold and soggy. Price on the more expensive side. Wouldn't go again"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveXY3RHNnRRAB,Srisun,2,"Their standards have dropped massively. The chicken briyani was very generic and lacked taste. The mee goreng has no wokhey and tastes of simple tomato sauce and not much else. We have been going to this place for 5 years, but this may be our last time."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMnVfQWp3RRAB,Srisun,5,"Friendly staff and food tastes amazing. Will definitely recommend. However, be aware that their sambar curry can be salty at times"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdWMyc0pREAE,Srisun,5,They had alot types of prata like cheese prata and chocolate prata. Very nice 👌
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvd2ZubFh3EAE,Srisun,3,"Just your average 24 Hour prata shop in the neighbourhood coffee shop. Nothing outstanding but it isn't terrible either. I don't actually recommend coming here for supper since they usually pre-prepare the pratas and leave them aside, so they aren't as fresh as you'd like. During day time is fine"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZdjRLZE9nEAE,Srisun,1,"If can I wanted to give 0 star to this shop. Order briyani chicken sambal, chicken curry and fried chicken for take away, told them to separate the curry from the rice but when wanted to eat it, my rice is as wet as ocean and sambal chicken only taste spicy not even salty or any sweetness."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnMHBEQ01BEAE,Srisun,1,"Worst place ever! Took so long to make my two prata and when I asked for it shown me stupid face and asked me again what’s my orders like a gangster.(the younger staff). I have been here for many years all elderly staff don’t do that. That’s 7am and the Coffeeshop really not so busy yet, if u not happy don’t sell here.Refused to give me curry and I have to ask for it! Prata don’t come with curry??? The Rivervale crescent branch (Seng Kang) Blk 178."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNE5yTFZnEAE,Srisun,5,Awesome Prata with or without egg. And a punch with mutton curry. They are good! The curry is rich and tasty. The mutton has no smell of goat.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3d0x6ZVZBEAE,Srisun,1,Plain and egg pratas are usually pre-made and not upon order hence cold and soggy.  New order made was not fulfilled and staff is on mobile phone and rest try to look busy.  Overall experience is bad and left with an empty stomach.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvdDRHbjVBRRAB,Srisun,1,"Dropby the Yishun outlet opposite Orchid Park Sec School, standard drop dramatically. Ordered Chicken Biryani but the photo i attached is what i got. Just 2 pieces of chicken, not even a breast or thigh. No papadum as well, where the photo clearly shows there is papadum. When asked, the lady rudely replied: ""is just photo, not real"" Do take note fellow customers when ordering. This is by far the worst Biryani I had so far."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBd3UtWV93RRAB,Srisun,4,"Srisun Prata is one of the more popular stalls in the coffee shop. They offer variety of prata and tosei. Nasi bryani is available and so are kambing soup and even Ayam Penyet, a version of malay Chicken rice. A good place for your lunch or dinner but be prepared to queue. Weekend queue is always longer."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRZ05uWF9RRRAB,Srisun,1,2nd time visiting this shop after being taken over by Srisun. Previously the service was superb . The people take so Long to initiate order from customers eventhough not many customers around. Left without ordering . This is the worst shop ever!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LThla1lREAE,Srisun,1,Waited for 30mins! So disappointed with the service. I order first and yet the customer behind me get their food first. What is this! Srisun please do something about it!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdGFTelpnEAE,Srisun,4,"One of the better prata shops i patronise. The main difference is this shop sell chilli sardines to go with the pratas. Shop also provides lFREE ikan bilis sambal chilli too, short of lesser bilis nowadays(recommend that SHOP SELL the ilan bilis sambal to customers)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHa3JTVkV3EAE,Srisun,1,"Very bad, not open, lazy staff don’t want cook prata for me"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcUl6SlR3EAE,Srisun,2,Quality has gone down the hill. They pre fry too many pratas and wait for people to order so it's already cold and tough. Not worth going back
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvcFBXMkh3EAE,Srisun,1,Previously order various prata for $6.40. Had the same order but was charge $8 instead. The person was rude and not keen in explaining the extra charges

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyMk8tU01BEAE,D'Rubinah Eating Place Pte Ltd,5,"Chanced upon this gem while working around this area. Had the $7 mutton briyani and $2.5 Katira drink. Finished the briyani in no time as it was delicious. Meat was not too firm and gravy was perfect for the bismati rice. Server even asked me if it was enough, should have asked for more but watching my diet lately. 😝 Saw rows of the green drink and asked what it was. Thought it was avocado with gula Melaka but it’s called Katira. Not bad but not cold enough, think they just made it. The green drink tastes a bit like Bandung and the black stuff is grass jelly and some other stuff. My friend said it’s popular during Ramadan so I guess it’ll be nice and cold in the evening. Place is 24 hours, think will come here with friends for supper here next time."

The environment is neat and tidy, quiet.
Enjoyed it's quietness, peace, tranquility.

Food is just slightly above average, not tried all menu yet, but had 2 egg prata and a teh tarik.
Prata was springy, not crunchy.
Teh tarik was almost tasteless, water ratio too much, little taste of tea."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeC0yYVF3EAE,D'Rubinah Eating Place Pte Ltd,1,"Please avoid this vendor.

This eatery should be boycotted. Ripping off your money for unhygienic food. My Husband waited 45 mins for his takeaway order of 2 mee goreng and 1 nasi goreng thai. Extremely exhausted and hungry on a Saturday night, plus it was raining. We just wanted to taobao food home in peace.

The cook is from India, no offence meant, I am a local Indian. But majority cooks from India working in eateries here clearly do not know or do not bother to learn the local singaporean/malaysian mamak flavours.

Semi-cooked mee soaking in oil and the mee goreng sambal. No eggs, no veg. And the cook had the audacity to stuff the dirty paper receipt (which fell on the ground) into my mee. Contamination. Similarly, prepared oil and rice mix. Prawns were raw and not cleaned for the nasi goreng thai. I was grossed out.

Worst is the packer spills in lots of tomato ketchup, with no cucumbers into the oily mee. Why? I have no idea. Wonder how many people suffered from stomach upset.

Unbelievable mess. I saw many other customers having to remind them their orders.
We were charged $17 for this nonsense. We couldn't eat. Had to throw all away. Such a rip off.

I called up this shop the same night. The person in charge who claims his name is Raja was passive aggressive on the phone, aggravating me further, did not apologize, did not offer a refund. Typical, unscrupulous attitude. He doesn't even feel accountable for cheating a customer. Lack of conscience and ethics. Indecent.

I'm not sure how this outlet is still operating. Clearly the D'Rubinah management does not care despite the numerous complaints and poor reviews against them. They are simply getting rich by cheating customers. Customers (including me but no more!) are enabling these unscrupulous vendors.

Authorities NEA or SFA should look into this place. There's absolutely no hygiene, no actual cooking except slathering lots of oil into uncooked noodles, stuffing receipts directly into the mee. Lack of ethics too. I'm sad the hard earned money went to waste, we slept hungry that night, and even disappointed that the local mamak food culture is rampantly ruined. Real sorry state.

I'm actually furious that my 17 bucks was wasted at this place. No more patronizing at all the D rubinah outlets. Have shared my experience with friends and they too are boycotting this place."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpb3VHMEtREAE,D'Rubinah Eating Place Pte Ltd,2,"Have visited this place about 5 times. Food is ok but you have to wait for really long just to get your food.

There are many staff but it seems like only one person cooking all the time. The restaurant may not be busy but food still takes real long to come. And sometimes after waiting for 15 mins for your food, they will still come and inform you that the water is boiling still or the chef had gone off for an emergency. And ask you if you would still like to carry on waiting. I’ve tried giving them  benefit if the doubt but I think I’ve learnt my lesson. Food will always be slow to come."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbXVXWHFnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Don't you just love it when planned things go wrong and the unplanned becomes a gem of a place?
That's what happened to my wife and I earlier this evening. We drove down to Sembawang to eat dinner at the Chong Pang Nasi Lemak place. It was closed.
We walked along the row of shophouses, and chanced upon this Indian restaurant.
We both love Indian food, so we walked in, sat down and I scoured the dishes in their counter and the ones in their menu.

Arabic rice, not bryani, I was told. Long grains of yellow rice with spice and raisins inside, accompanied by piquant, slightly spicy, super melt-in-the-mouth mutton in curry, and a bowl of my favourite Indian Tom Yum, rasem! Aromatic happy meal at its very best.
Wife had the paper thin, crispy garlic naan, with fish curry, and we shared some fish cutlets, cauliflower 65 (yup! Not chicken 65), and tau-kwa in sambal.
We're both so delighted we found this place! The food's great, the people inside warm and Very Friendly, and a dinner bill that didn't raise my eyebrows. Mind you, this doesn't happen too often these days, when everything is so pricey!

Cheap food, good food, and great service! I can't find any fault with this place! Give it a try! You won't regret it 😘"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaktXSWt3RRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Been there for lunch on Saturday at around 1.30 pm and the place had enough seating available. All of the food that we ordered was good. The satti sorru is actually good enough for 2 people. The mutton pepper was the highlight with an amazing thick gravy and soft meat. The chicken and the prawn in the satti sorru was pretty tasty. The seabass masala was just deep fried seabass with an extra coating of some masala. It might look spicy but it's just right and not too overpowering. All of that with a couple of butter milk and a coconut cost us SGD 82.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX2MyQ0xBEAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,3,"The ambience is simple n neat. No special mention to the upkeep or deco of the place.

The food we ordered were mutton biryani and mee goreng.

Food was served within 15 mins. The mutton biryani was not so special. Normal and raita was not so good. Side gravy was sambar! Why sambar for biryani?

The only saving item in e platter is the mutton pcs which were juicy n gravy was spicy n tasty.

Mee goreng was a messy wet mixture of uncooked masala n day old fried chicken pcs wt bones. Unnecessarily spicy and its a raw masala soaked yellow mee.

Overall its only good for one time try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHanMtY0p3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Simple place with home cooked feel Indian food.
Their claypot rice series real standouts and the briyani meals flavourful. Be prepared to wait for the claypot rice. Pricing wise is pretty reasonable considering the huge portions. Good for sharing with others unless you have a big appetite. Only downside to the location is the limited parking places available along the drive way."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDlHeHJnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"I loved their briyani, Satti Sorru and Naan! They were kind enough to reserve a table for me during the last hour. Totally worth the money and time spent with my family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhbjQ3c19RRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Loved the meal here. The store is dated, but the food is excellent. You get a fantastic Indian restaurant meal at such affordable price. The fried mushroom is a must try. Prawn Satti Soru is sufficient for 2-3 persons, and it's the brilliant and extensive count of prawns. The curry fish is fury but great for people like me who are into spicy food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNjhDc0pREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,4,Quite cosy place to chill out for food. The flavours of food is really delicious. Reaasonable priced with huge portion. Great family hangout place.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOWQtWmdRRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"One of the best indian food I tried in Singapore. Some dish you can't even find in other restaurant. Recommend to order their claypot rice which is damn delicious, I even dabao another for supper. I forgotten the name on the menu thou."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURta1BfdF9nRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,My favourite ikan bilis satti soru. Slightly expensive but big portion. Reccomended to share by 2 pax. Love the ice cream too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2UtbU5REAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,4,"Was greeted with a nice smell when I entered the restaurant, that reminded me of Banana Leaf Restaurant at Race Course road. Ordered vegetarian satti soru - cooked with tahu sambal and sambar. Portion size was big - can feed two people. Taste wise, I would have liked it spicy though. Tasted somewhat like sambar rice - good for a one-time experience. Will definitely try other vegetarian items the next time. Friendly staff! Highly recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydG9IR3lRRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"The food is amazing. My favourite items are the mee goreng, chapati, mysore mutton. But there are many other good dishes as well. The unique thing about this place is that the food really tastes like it's home-cooked, with love. Also very generous with the portions. Would highly recommend for events catering!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNzdDR2hBRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,After a long tiring day I was super hungry wanted something nice to eat. It was already 8:30pm. I ordered Udang Satti Sooru and nandu rasam. The food came and it's safe to say I was a happy child after the 1st bite. I slept like a Snorlax..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX2Jmb05REAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"I was there for dinner with a few friends and we had a great experience eating there! They were patient with us as we ordered multiple times because we wanted to try more food.

We loved the Chicken 65 and Mutton dishes 🙌

Even though we stayed closed to closing, they were very patient in waiting for us to finish. Appreciate the service and standard of food!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5d1BXZFp3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Friendly boss and servers. The clay pot chicken is a must order dish followed by that demure looking spicy crab soup which blows my nose away. Found another good dinner near my residence. Tables are a bit limited and not much interior deco. The food is the main star. Oh the bru coffee n masala tea is good! Will definitely come to try all the other dishes soon.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Njk3LWF3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Friendly and excellent Food wàs delicious and reasonably priced Second visit was better with more dishes all of which tasted good especially bitter gourd 65 and reasonably priced
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNa2RtOGN3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,4,"Good selection of vegetables, unlike some Indian restaurants. I liked the tofu sambal and the mutton. The mutton especially was flavourful and cooked just nice. Kedongdong juice had an interesting taste and was refreshing. Service was polite and prompt, though they did struggle when there was a crowd. Overall, we had a good, affordable meal. Definitely worth a try."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBeHBlOGtBRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Third time dining here and excellent as always. They serve wonderfully authentic, home-style Indian classics and they have also started serving a new Penang food range which is amazing as well. We ordered Pratas and Chapatis to mop up the flavourful curries on this visit and they were perfect.Our new favourite Indian food joint. Our family of 10 left with full tummies and big smiles. Superb value for money as well. Happy days!!

Edit: Came by again on 25 Apr 21 and the food was amazing still. Satti Sorru, Sambal Seabass, Prawn Sothi and Chicken 65 we all executed perfectly. Fully recommended."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5enVLVjNRRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"This humble restaurant tucked at a little corner is really a gem. Recommended by a friend. A small cozy restaurant with limited seats. Service was great and food was excellent, definitely have the home taste.
We ordered vegetarian and chicken masala set with a side dish of prawn masala. Food was served promptly. Nice to go with a cup of ‘tea halia’.
Will definitely return to try the remaining dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5b2RQQjh3RRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,The best indian food in town. Home cook style food.  The prawn & Chicken Satti Sorru (Claypot Indian Style)  & prawn sothi  (Prawn lemak)  & crab rasam was awesome! Super service! Better make reservation on weekends!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleExmT2hnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"We were very happy with the service and food.All the items we ordered,arrived piping hot and was very delicious.We ordered 3 rice,cauliflower manchurian,salted fish sambal,prawn masala, mutton masala with tea,milo and watermelon juice.The total bill was $53,and I think it is very reasonable as their portions are very decent.Thumbs Up Grace's Pot👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLckliOVJREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"As always, their Prawn and Ikan Belis Satti Soru did not disappoint! Full of flavour and a generous portion too. The Nandu Rasam was also spicy and delicious! No complaints. The service was prompt too! Great treat on May Day 😁"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbDdpNXpnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"BEST PLACE IN SG FOR SATTI SORRU.

The prawn Masala and Naan Combo Is out of the world"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzeEppdXBnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Great tasting home cooked style in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Food cooked without the use of MSG to get the great authentic Indian food taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpX0pxSFZBEAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Must try the “Indian claypot” dish (topped with fried egg) in this picture. That is their specialty and it seems to me local (Malaysian/ Singaporean India n) specialty. Do come and “Taste and see” these authentic local Indian cuisine!!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4cmFXZTN3RRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Amazing Resto for Indian food . Owner is very interacting and very friendly staff are good usually busy in afternoon and night ... Food is tasty well effort made my management.... had a great experience....
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwLW9MWFd3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"If you are craving for a taste of home cooked Indian curries that reminds you of all that youthful goodness, this is the place for you. Try the onion curry, salted fish curry and briyani. Ooolala. Suresh the owner and chef, also offers off menu items also that simply wows! Top notch and simply delish! Will definitely return. A quick word of caution about the super limited car park lots available in front of the shop."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3eWFDZ1JREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,3,"First visit, Vegetable Thali - It was excellent.
Egg fry was wonderful.

2nd Visit, Vegetable Biryani - Not to my taste and not like a usual Indian vegetable biryani.
Vegetable biryani should have vegetables (Flavoured rice or masala rice can't be named as Vegetable Biryani).

3rd Visit, Vegetable Biryani - Still the same but this time the side dish (Cauliflower 65 was mixed completely in dry so called Biryani Rice). This was not good compared to my 2nd visit.

Advice to customer is that know what you are ordering. No harm to ask people there about what you would get."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVbmJDNEV3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"+ Authentic indian cuisine - taste like home cooked food

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZ09yczR3RRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Saw this a week before when me and my partner was on our way to sembawang hot spring water and my partner did his research and brought me here today to surprise me.. Loved the food which tasted like home cooked food.. My partner wanted bitter gourd 65 but unfortunately the vegetable wasn't available nevertheless he ordered cauliflower 65 and finished the whole serving by himself. The highlight was the ""Price"" which definitely not expensive as other restaurants. We both was full the whole day until we skipped our dinner.. Thumbs up 👍👍👍👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycVlDcVBREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,The food here is superb! Almost all the dishes we tried had a genuine home-cooked flavour to them which is difficult to find nowadays. Highly recommended!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaTZUY0p3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"We went there on Deepavali.

It was our first visit.

And we enjoyed every one of the dishes we ordered.

If you're someone who appreciates homecooked foods, you should visit this restaurant and try out the food for yourself.

But if you're someone who enjoys alittle more of a sophisticated kind of ambience or even food styles (a.k.a atas/fine dining) then you may not enjoy dining at this place.

But for me and my family, we'll certainly come back and dine here again.

Thank you Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant!😊"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb05QOC1BRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,1,"Terrible place. Order chicken 65, they gave nothing but bone,skin and batter, barely any chicken meat.
Order the mutton claypot rice, come out huge portion of rice but only small chunks of mutton bones and fats, couldnt even taste any mutton meat.

When raise this issue to the staff, this indian lady replied back so rudely saying ""you come late, this what we have left""

Wth seriously? If you out of meat, then say dish nt available la! Not give us scraps and leftovers from the kitchen but charge us full price.

FYI, we came to dine in at about 5.30-6ish. I wonder how is that even considered ""late"" in their minds, when the dinner crowd only started picking up at about 6.30pm after us.

Terribly disappointed with such low quality dish and rude service. My first visit to this restaurant shall be my first and last. Even kopitiam indian shop also serve better quality food. Never coming back to this ""Scam-pot"" restaurant again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNjZ2X3pRRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Nice food
Very good dry fish curry
Affordable price"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbjVyc2pnRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"One of the the best restaurants that serves home like cooked meals. Initially their cuisine was really spicy and I’m a person I can’t take spicy food. After numerous feedbacks, they did actually took it into serious consideration and now I must say they have really improved on their spicy level, and it’s much more enjoyable to eat! Thank you for considering our feedbacks and allowing different tastebuds and thresholds to really enjoy your food wholeheartedly. I will definitely patronise this shop as this is the only Shop from my understanding does NOT USE MSG in their cooking and their food tastes like a good home cooking. Keep up the good work and kindly keep this level of moderate and mild spicy so everyone one of us can enjoy. 👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHJ5U21nRRAB,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,4,"It was my first time visiting this place for dinner with a friend on a saturday evening .
The restaurant was small with limited seatings.
Not so organised maybe due to the small area.
But the ambience was cozy.
We ordered 1 satti sooru each and hardly couldnt finish due to the potion.. hahaha.
But well the food and drinks were nice though .😊
Price was ok also."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOGFEOVpBEAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Was my first time there and I could instantly tell why it is a crowd favourite. The satti soru was HEAVENLY. Reminded me of a nice home cooked meal. We tried both the chicken and the prawn satti soru and both were delicious, but I preferred the prawn more.

The iced teh was sweet, but not to the point where it was overwhelming. I loved it nonetheless.

The staff will also give you a complimentary carrot halwa and even that was out of the world. And this is coming from someone who never really fancied halwa.

If not for the location, I would be their frequent customer, but I am definitely returning for more when I can."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcl9Hek13EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,4,"Decided to try this place out, and I must say I've been pleasantly surprised. Ordered the veggie meal and it was fantastic. They go easy on the salt, keeping the taste homely and grounded. Good variety of veggies. Good portions. Liked the rasam and the pickle. Loved the presentation with clay utensils (incl. the water jug). Was about to order ginger tea and they recommended an off-menu item, Masala tea (Must try, just request them to use milk rather than the usual for a rich, milky texture). Place has a wonderful, homely atmosphere. A quiet ambience. Staff was extremely courteous and polite, including a very passionate owner. The menu is authentic South Indian cuisine based, with dishes I hadn't even heard of.
If you wanna have a good, off-the-beat, authentic South Indian experience, give this place a try."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4MEphREt3EAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,Really good food and friendly boss. Will come back to try the fish head curry and crab soup (they've got a lot more items off menu that you can pre order in advance because they only want to cook fresh food). Had the chicken satti soru (something like claypot rice but nicer and with a kick) and mutton meal (white rice with 2 veg).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyamJ6d2JREAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"Amazing food. Please come and support!!!! 🙆‍♀️ we ordered the fish curry, prawn masala, pears and garlic naan"

He took my order over the phone and when I arrived to pick up, everything was packed and ready! I ordered the Mutton, Ikan Bilis and Prawn Satti Soru. The leftovers tasted great the next day too.

Taste was super ..will visit again with friends..as the quantity they serve is good enough to share . We have pick with limited items but it will tempt to chose all ...so may not be one visit enough..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOHFMUWFnEAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,2,Food is good but bad service. Restaurant was pretty empty but food took half hr because they kept packing food for the grab orders. Only served us when my mum asked how long more. Feels like they prioritise online orders more than people who make an effort to come to the shop.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNMXQtM0FnEAE,Grace's Pot Indian Restaurant,5,"My FamBam- 4 non vegetarians and 4 vegans- had lunch on a weekend. Mr Suresh, the owner, oversaw the order of the vegan items(see photo) and brought them to our table. What a personal touch! Some of us ordered the Amra juice which was like a cross between the sugar cane and the Amla fruit(Indian gooseberry). We loved it. They say: The way to a (hu)man's heart  is through his/her stomach. Grace's Pot lives up to it.Thank you Mr Suresh...for the reasonably priced finger licking food and to yours and your staff's personable service despite it being a busy Sunday dining hours:-)"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNEx1WTlnRRAB,Rathana Bhavan Indian Vegetarian Restaurant (B2 Kopitiam) - Yishun North Point,1,"importance and priority given to those take away. Me who was dining had to wait 25mins for my food... Indian veg meal, all diluted gravies and bland tasting food, for $8.50 is awful experience...
In the past we used to order occasionally when the uncle was there...we really loved the taste and food. But now it's awful...

The young man, is burdened up with lots of orders to serve, to pack and for those delivery orders... Whilst the  cashier lady is just manning her cash register... She should instead help with serving those whom are dining to clear the que faster...

Lets hope this matters sorts out with a good solution and coordination. Hope that next time I will get a pleasant experience. Thanks 🙏."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2a19QMTVBRRAB,Rathana Bhavan Indian Vegetarian Restaurant (B2 Kopitiam) - Yishun North Point,1,"I m very disappointed and disgusted with the service all the frontline today. My order was for 8 thosai n 6 vadais. They took about an hour that after i approached them after numerous attempts. They just totally ignored my order. And when they did my packing i realised actually the thosais were prepared long way back. And after an hour i asked the staff whether the vadais were done, she didnt have the decency to admit that they are still making it Instead she said she is packing it.
I would never logo there again n for extra sambar they charged me $6,fter i spent $47.
They don have the respect for timing. And i feel sorry that the food delivery guys had to endure the same as me. I sincerely feel the management shd look seriously into this. The staff is rude, unapproachable and just have a sickening attitude."

When I ask them to escalate my orders, one girl asked me to go to kitchen and check myself. Terrible! Only one nice lady did hear my complains and apologized.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNEllOER3EAE,Rathana Bhavan Indian Vegetarian Restaurant (B2 Kopitiam) - Yishun North Point,1,Service poor. Priority given to take away orders. No team coordination within workers. I hope owner take swift action into this matter as it frustrates customers to wait for their food for 20minutes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWJpb3J3RRAB,Elahe family restaurant,4,A small but nice Indian Muslim restaurant. the Roti Prata one of the best around the area. the mutton soup is normal...not salty enough for me.

Do they hear the order correctly?"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdEktWnNnRRAB,Elahe family restaurant,3,"Food is good , place is cosy for chats and lay backs. Only service is severely lacking as workers are more keen in chatting among themselves than paying attention to diners who wants to order despite a not crowded weekend night."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbHA3eVhBEAE,Elahe family restaurant,3,"Some selling roti prata,didnt put the notice of foods price,every Roti prata shop the price is different."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhdEx5NFFnEAE,Elahe family restaurant,5,"Prata that is a cut above the rest without being expensive. Even though Elahe has low prices and is open for long hours, their food is consistently very tasty. Despite having ate far too much prata to the point where it all began to taste the same, this store made me enjoy it again. It is savoury and full of flavour without being too oily or too dry. Even their briyani is quite good, and lacks many of the issues that make briyani from other stores unpleasant (dry chicken, tasteless rice, too little curry). I might or might not always order more prata from them than I am supposed to.

Note: This is a review based on older visits. It is part of a series of reviews for stores with excellent customer service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdGFMMUtBEAE,Elahe family restaurant,5,Friendly staff! Amazing food! They sell the best Indian rojak in Singapore!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaHRfT0JnEAE,Elahe family restaurant,5,"One of the best Indian muslim food restaurants in Chong Pang! Indian rojak, mutton/chicken steaks, their masala dosa's red chilli chutney is super nice better than some that I have eaten previously, they also make nice drinks too eg. Teh O limau panas just nice not too thick and not super sweet and their Milo kosong is well done with just the exact amount of Milo powder portion!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdXJ2YWVnEAE,Elahe family restaurant,3,Personally I prefer this Indian stall to others around the area. The standard of food is there and the variety of choices available is also there. Their western is a super worth while option because for a whole chicken cutlet combo with coke cost $6.50 or so(for those seeking protein til 11pm) friendly customer service and jovial owner. Easily accessible by private transportation but may need to walk a bit if taking public transportation. Really close by the wet market for shopping

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaHE2TmV3EAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Quick service. Arrived on Sunday at 7pm with queue but turnover service is fast.
Good quality Japanese food at reasonable price.
Service is attentive but I feel not personal as staff were quite clumsy, hence deduct 1 star.
Where I was seated at, very sticky floors."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X0lHWWpRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"Good sushi in the heartlands! Went here with my wife as we were craving for sushi. Have to say, we were pleasantly surprised at the high quality food and service.

As soon as we were seated, it felt as if we were transported away from the heartlands with the high class decor and atmosphere. The service was top notch with each staff being very welcoming and prompt. The sushi and sashimi were delectable and tasted fresh. My wife went with their Udon which had a very delicious broth and springy noodles. I went with the Yakiniku Don and it had strong beefy flavours and savoury sauce.

Don't sleep on their dessert offerings too, this is one you won't want to miss! The Matcha ice cream was great but I can't stop raving about their Chocolate Wafer! Vanilla Ice cream with great quality thin chocolate bar in the centre sandwiched between wafers - every bite kept me wanting more and luckily for us, the portion was very generous.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit here if you're ever craving for great Japanese food."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNy1mWFRREAE,SUSHI TEI,5,"Located near the original section of Northpoint Shopping Centre.
Best to avoid meal times to skip the crowd.
Wide variety of Japanese food selection, from sashimi, sushi, don and noodles.
Prices were still considered reasonable.
Services rendered was very basic. Nothing outstanding or worth mentioning about their services.
Maybe because, all the orders could be placed through the iPad, so minimal contact with the staffs.
Still one of the classical places to go for sushi in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXZ2J5Uk1REAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Good service and huge variety of food options.

Golden Roll - Good amount of mango, prawn was okay.
Chawanmushi - Average and tastes like how it should be.
Mentaiko Squid - This was really good, generous mentaiko and huge piece of squid!
Hanasaki Ika Tempura - This is the must order whenever at Sushi Tei, crispy and delicious!
Hotate Tamago Udon - Average

Good place to eat with a group of friends given the large menu. Will be back for the Hanasaki Ika Tempura and Mentaiko Squid."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbThhY2RnEAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Staff -
Staff were attentive and kind, quick to respond and aware of our needs.

Food -
To be honest, the food was not great. We ordered the Zuwai Chanwanmushi, Salmon Aburi roll and Kani Mentai Mayo Roll. We much prefer Itacho Sushi’s rolls.
More affordable, and tasty.

Environment -
The environment was chill, but it was busy as it was on a Sunday night, we waited 15 minutes to be called for our turn."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb3J2WVp3EAE,SUSHI TEI,4,Really tasty and fresh sashimi and sushi. Pork cutlet wasn’t that nice. I will skip that next time. Sushi tei tends to quite consistent across branches.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPLU1lSDl3RRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,"Nice pot of sukiyaki, beef. Sparkling peach from Japan, abit sweet. Enjoy the wonderful ceiling jazz strings music. Was the one customer to go at 940pm."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaU5mWHdRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"Finally we are back to Sushi Tei NPC outlet.
Something is missing...Zuwai Crab & Seafood Fried Rice from the menu which is the all time sold out in SG as it is really one of the best fried rice I have ever tasted.
But You can try Zuwai Gani Chawanmushi."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMGZhb05BEAE,SUSHI TEI,5,Service was good. Foods are delicious. Always kept their standard. Sashimi is fresh.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeTRXUEFREAE,SUSHI TEI,5,"Is a Saturday evening, having family dinner hence  we finally came.  Tonight we ordered as if we are in Johar Bahru. Ordered 20 over items.

The sashimi is fresh, curry is nice, upon is nice, fried cuttlefish is awesome.

Wow a very well spend dinner together with my family.  A little waiting time and is all worth it.

Staff here are all super friendly.
Happy mom happy kids."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcGZTa0lBEAE,SUSHI TEI,5,"Joining their membership is good deal, pay $68 and get 80 points in return which is equal to $80 (to be used in 12months), every meal gets 10% rebate , birthday month gets 20% rebate. 😀
Since unable to travel this time, here is the best place to indulge when miss 🇯🇵 . Food was nice, staff was friendly and nice ambiance."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcWVDNk9BEAE,SUSHI TEI,3,"We are big fans of Sushi Tei but the last time we dine here we made a mistake of ordering a supposedly ramen noodles that came as reinvented Instant Noodles with sautéed onion, chives, meat and egg. That was the biggest disappointment, we were looking forward for a decent ramen. We ordered a plate of Sushi with supposedly crispy salmon skin at the centre but that too failed us, it was gummy and chewing was a struggle.

We still love Sushi Tei but next time probably stick to the safer and premium choices we've always loved."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNHJqNGhBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"A decent Japanese outlet to go to in the neighbourhood. Not the cheapest u can get but definitely one of the better choices.
Beef salad is always my best bet and salmon mentaiko is equally great!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NnRuZnNRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,2,"The operation/service quality is a disappointment. Brought my family here for dad’s birthday dinner, ordered some sides & 3 mains within 10mins all the items was served except for 1 main
After asking the staffs to check for us a couple of time the dish finally came! Took a 30mins gap to arrive! The staff (Rachel)black uniform if I see correctly wasn’t even apologetic when serving it to us 👎🏼
The pork katsu was tougher than my life 🙃"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1OGFHNXRRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,Many times came here before.. but now the prices increased! Too pricey 🙈
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MzRQV2Z3EAE,SUSHI TEI,5,Good quality Japanese food. Attentive service. I like it that there is a relatively high level of customisation allowed too.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPX3FucThBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,At least this place have a decent sushi. Try to avoid lunch time or dinner time. Always long queue. Price on a high side . Can be cheaper
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMjVMTm5RRRAB,SUSHI TEI,3,"This is next to Swensens, in the old wing, second floor. Great service. Most of the food we ordered came quickly. The dishes that were decent were the specialty roll, and the wakame salad. The pidan tofu was not bad. The pork cutlet was tough and hence disappointing. The chirashi don was the worst with little seasoning - just a few slices of sashimi topped on lots of rice. They don't take reservations here. Green tea is refillable. Our bill came up to $73 + for three of us."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLb1BXRXFnRRAB,SUSHI TEI,2,"Been eating at Sushi Tei since the late 1990s. Very sad to say, their standard has dropped.... the place didn't look too clean too. Many nice new sushi restaurants of better value and quality have sprung up all these years...."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJNDctT0t3EAE,SUSHI TEI,2,"Had the shrimp-vegetable fritter on rice. There was way too much flour and not enough sauce, so it was a very dry meal. The enoki wrapped in beef was good as usual. Service was sufficient, ambience was serviceable. …"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLazV1S2xBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"Consistently yummy & fresh sushi and sashimi; even their edamame is served warm and slightly salted. Prices are just a tad high compared to other mainstream Japanese restaurant chains, but it's worth the food quality and pleasant service. …"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbGRPZHVBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,3,"Revisited after few months and there's good improvement to the quality of food. Ordered Crispy Salmon Mentaiko, Iberico Pork, Salmon Sashimi(limited time 1-1 promo with UOB) and a Tendon. The Tendon fell short of expectation, but that again …"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJOTRDR2lnRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,I don’t really anything to complaint about this place. Specialty rolls are super good and I’m a fan of Ramen 🍜 and theirs is very good. Prices are a little high but in general acceptable for the location and food quality …
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM01fX3FRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,Good service each time I come. The place is quieter in the afternoon but dinner is a like a screaming restaurant especially when you are seated near kids. The food is not consistent especially the salads. Sometimes you get nice vegetable …
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5eHBXTmhnRRAB,SUSHI TEI,3,Food was ok. Ambient was a bit dark for our liking. Sushi/bento/ramen/udon quite a selection of Japanese dishes.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURReGI3V2hBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,"Comfy seats, nice ambience at almost every outlet. Sushi tei is the go to jap restaurant for a quick fix to your Japanese 食べ物cravings. Food quality is almost consistent and quite fresh. Firm favs remain the mentaiko salmon, sashimi salad, …"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aG9mVWxRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,Love the quality of food they served and their service is simply awesome! 👍 …
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2N19IYjlBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"I've always enjoy the food from Sushi Tei. It's very fresh and they always have new seasonal items. today I had the lobster roll 1-for-1 because of UOB card promo, then a must have Kani Chawanmushi, with a piping hot Yosenabe. so good! …"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXX0lpb0F3EAE,SUSHI TEI,2,"Very disappointed! It could be the Yishun brand is not up to normal sushi tei standards: very salty for every dish, the chef loss the taste or … ; curry rice the curry sauce is salty and artificial … seriously not a good experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1b2I3andRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,4,"Ambient was good. Not too noisy. Food came relatively fast enough.
Simple to order through the tablet"

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaUtheEp3EAE,SUSHI TEI,5,Always love the sashimi salad! I think it's the best among the Japanese eating outlets.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaS0tRFR3EAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Food is adequately fresh
Good service!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNclp6ZVpBEAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Lunch promotion was lackluster... Food are quite good..

Price wise it's on the higher side.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXZzQtN0lBEAE,SUSHI TEI,4,"Services were still good, however it may be a little slow or required multiple attempt to capture the personnel attention. Food items offered are still of high quality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwa01Ib093EAE,SUSHI TEI,5,Have a good variety of dishes to select. Great food and ambiance.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTLThPWHVBRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,Crowded as expected. Waiting time of about 10min but the staff was helpful. Food was slight above average. 5 stars for overall service.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNkoyVUxREAE,SUSHI TEI,4,Prompt service with friendly staff! Ingredients are very fresh too with quite substantial portion.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhOE5PMXFnRRAB,SUSHI TEI,3,"Food is really good but unfortunately, the service provided in this restaurant at Northpoint was subpar. Grill cod fish was served cold, with diluted/watery teriyaki sauce. Service staff was almost non-existent. Sushi took about 35 minutes to serve. This was after I politely reminded the staff that I still have missing orders."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0eWZuTklnEAE,SUSHI TEI,5,Fresh ingredients. Only problem was the wait time for table. But I guess is normal for peak hours. Will definitely come back again.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM29iQjhRRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,Always my favourite Japanese restaurant ❤️
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHek1Ea2l3RRAB,SUSHI TEI,1,"Brought customer for lunch yesterday, 3 of us rejected by the stuff here..

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bHFiaEN3EAE,SUSHI TEI,5,One of the go to place if I want to have food indulgence.. I love that they open their branch here..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cW9EMDBnRRAB,SUSHI TEI,5,"My family and I went to the outlet at Northpoint City to have dinner. We ordered the Yakitori Don and many others. When the Yakidori Don came, I was surprised to see that the amount of chicken was much lesser and made the remark the moment …"
