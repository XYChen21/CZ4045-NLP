Chef Hatch is having his pop up restaurant here at OUE Social kitchen in a casual cozy setting.
- We had the Omakase course and I sort of lost count on the number of times that was served 😆
- Service by his crew was impeccable, with little details well taken care of.
- We were very well pampered and I made sure I booked my spot for next month before leaving 👍🏼"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDX0xINHRnRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"This is my third time to attend her cooking classes.  This time is the Chicken Xiao Long Bao.  It is awesome and the Chef Payal is the Best.  Her class is well organized and I learnt a lot from making the chicken stock to how to make dumplings. Of course, the Xiao Long Bao is seriously delicious and juicy! Highly highly recommended her cooking classes to everyone!  👍"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRNzZMTndBRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,Nice place to host birthday party! U can do your cooking here with every kitchen essentials are provided. The best part is u can just leave after party and someone will do the cleaning up. NICE!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNROExYWTh3RRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"Great concept! Affordable cook your own lunch with team mates / dinner with friends session in a condusive small group environment. Our session was a paella night, $60 per group of 5. As shown, paella kit was provided. Totatally enjoyable...we went hungry, waiting and salivating. When its done, we just ate right from the pan at the induction stove. Every group will somehow find their own cosy corner. Small pot of paella yet satisfying return for everyone.  Friendly instructor and crew who will drop by to guide you when you need a tip or 2 during the cooking process.

Booking was promptly responded and payment was easily done through bank transfer.

Thumbs up and definitely recommended! =)

[Added - Mee Hoon Kueh lunchtime session. Awesome fun during lunchtime...though it states 45minutes in total, prepare for 1.5hr to cook and enjoy your masterpiece and hangout for awhile at OUE social kitchen."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcHF6NGtBRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"We attended the dumpling cooking class and learned how to make dumblings with 3 different fillings from scratch (we even did the dough ourselves). It is a lovely place, the session was well organized and the cooking stations are spacious and well equipped. We will definitely try it again at home 😊 - highly recommended!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncGUyMFJREAE,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"Fun concept for a gathering. Cook & eat together. Best thing is fuss free after cook, you don't need to clean up the mess. Haha!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXLWFLdG9nRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,Great venue for team building! Highly recommended. Thanks Kingsley for facilitating the session !!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDcVBhNXNnRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,Fun time with girlfriends! Cooking is fun when the dirty dishes disappear as you put them in the sink!  Chef Elsie was very patient in explaining the steps and gave us tips on how to make full use of the ingredients. Thanks for the fun experience!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVZ0xPdENBEAE,OUE Social Kitchen,4,Well equipped but would have been a better for participants to have single hands on experience for the complete execution of the dish. Having to share a workstation with strangers limits the full range of the cooking experience and having to compromise on performance of others in the group. I didn't sign up for a corporate bonding event.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3cHNYeGNnEAE,OUE Social Kitchen,4,"Tapas sharing concept, you can order some big and small plates to share. It all adds up quite substantially though so probably would recommend only for occasions you are prepared to splurge more. However it’s quite. A bustling environment. Dishes are quite innovative and delicious. Best to make reservations. Service is good."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHBLSHB3RRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"Tried their live zoom cooking session last saturday.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVdS12dmZ3EAE,OUE Social Kitchen,4,Interesting place for a team or company activity - The cooking is simple enough to follow but any bits of experience will help. Ingredients are prepared in such a way that the most difficult parts are already done for you.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBNjY3QzZBRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,"Love this place. Great for team bonding, family bonding or just a fun gathering with friends. Love the concept, affordable pricing, and best of all, no cleaning after cooking. Will definitely be back."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdHRETjN3RRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,5,A very fun and interactive team bonding place. A must try social and corporate event...
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVc2ZMbGxBRRAB,OUE Social Kitchen,2,The kitchen that looks like a makeshift kitchen shouldn’t be used at all. There’s no proper ventilation and the setup is a mess.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3OXFIY1VBEAE,OUE Social Kitchen,5,Friendly staff paired with a sleek yet cosy environment for cooking.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtamRlRTRRRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"Their signature duck was extremely good, however the rest of the dishes were rather mediocre. The crab and fish maw soup had barely any crab meat in it; it was probably too finely shredded you couldn’t see or even taste it. We had to add lots of vinegar into the soup else it’ll be bland.

The sauce of the barramundi went well with it, ensuring there wasn’t a fishy smell or taste to it.

The decor inside is really nicely set up, with dimmed lights to make the ambience cosy and intimate. Ladies, it can get quite chilly.

For the kind of price you pay here, you can easily get better quality Chinese cuisine elsewhere. It was a nice experience nevertheless!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdjYzSGl3RRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Stayed at the Duxton and ate here for dinner one night. Had two different soups (both good but their hot and sour soup was very very good), their signature roast duck (one of the best in town), a tofu dish (forgot the name but goes great with rice) and a simple vegetable (simple but cooked perfectly). We had white rice which came undercooked but we forgave them due to how good everything else was. Noisy and crowded but it was a Friday night so happy we opted for an early dinner. Our only bugbear were the crowds (good for the restaurant but a little worrisome for us in these COVID times). We would have gone back except for that. The duck is probably the best we've had in S'pore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N3Fla3ZBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"I celebrated my wedding anniversary here and ordered lovely dishes. We ordered four dishes: Fried Lion's mane mushroom, Crispy Sichuan chicken, Iberico pork cheek and braised Sichuan tofu. My favourite was the Lion's mane mushroom. It was simply delicious. The service was very good, maybe the restaurant was mostly empty. If the restaurant is full, one may experience staff shortage. Overall, nice experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyamZxcU9REAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"Very nice ambience and friendly waiters.

Dinning areas are decorated with a mixture of Oriental & Western feel, very comfortable.

Best food will be the Roast Duck, very succulent. Following fried prawn 🍤 with Bonito Aioli. Crabmeat Ee-fu Noodle 🍜 is nice."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtcWE2Tl9nRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"We tried the festive coursed menu and ordered some items a la carte.

The festive menu had some really outstanding items, and some below average ones. The ice cream dessert with honey was out of the world.

From the a la carte menu, we really liked the pork cheek appetizer, and the roast duck. The steamed Chilean sea bass was a complete dud - wayy too garlicky and one dimensional."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bzhxc1RBEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"Lovely interiors though it looks dark and foreboding on the outside. Service staff were polite and attentive on a Sunday lunch. Though there about 5 tables of guests, we were informed the restaurant was packed and dishes would take a while to come. Most enjoyable dish was the signature roast duck. Iberico pork cheek and Sichuan popcorn chicken were not excessively spicy. Efu noodles were pleasant and crabmeat egg white fried rice packed a nice flavour. Portions were small overall. The only dish that was underwhelming was the red bean pancake that was doughy and not crispy."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1XzVhd0R3EAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"Chose a chinese restaurant for our National Day dinner!

Has been recommended to this restaurant by many of my friends, we reach there early to make sure we can secure a parking space.

Yellow Pot at Duxton Reserve

We were very impressed with the Decor, I would categorised it as the Oriental Black Style but immediately after we settle down, we were disturbed by a group of Chinese Boys (tourist), tons of vulgarities and loud noise diffuse throughout the restaurant. Disappointed at their behaviour at such a classy and exquisite restaurant. Almost destroyed our dinning experience.

Let’s talk about the food.

We were informed that the food will take a bit of time to prepare and our first dish came out after 30 mins. But we were not disappointed with the food quality, the appetizer was Fried Prawns with Sesame Mayo, the big and crunchy prawn with the well-balanced Mayo sauce was a perfect match. This is follow by 2 soups, Double Boiled Chicken Soup and Crabmeat and Fish Maw. My wife love the crabmeat and fishmaw as it taste similar to her favourite sour-spicy soup. The chicken soup was great too, it comes with an abalone and it sure has been cooking for hours to attain this level of flavour.

The 2 mains we ordered were the Signature Roasted Duck and Fermented Red Wine Yeast Chilean Seabass. The duck was the purpose of this trip and it does not disappoint, crunchy and thin skin pair with the soft and savoury meat, simplify delightful. My wife love the seabass, it is a very small portion and quite salty therefore I would recommend that you pair the fish with some rice.

We also ordered the Freshly Peeled Crabmeat Fried Rice, with the price, I was expecting more crab meat but nonetheless, it taste awesome. You can eat the fried rice just on its own (without any side dishes).

Our dessert, Crispy Pancake with Red Bean Fillings, to my wife surprise, this was the best dish of the day. It looks ordinary but once you put a piece into your mouth, you will stop at nothing to eat the whole plate. It was that good! A Must Try

Rating: 8.5/10

If you are hungry for awesome chinese food with an amazing decor, look no further.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXa3NyQUFnEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"I liked the food and decoration, but service was not ideal. No one welcomed us after we sat and we had to wait for the menu. Although Waiters and Waitresses were walking around. Our dishes were not served together."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdjVpR2pBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"came here for dinner during weekdays.

maybe due to the sectional designed of the restaurant, it’s difficult to get attention and one ordered dish was missed out too.😓

wanted to try the Signature Roast Duck but was ran out.  Mango Sago ran out too.😅

the Crab & Fish Maw soup and the Fried Sesame “Wuxi” Pork Ribs were good!😋

the dark ambience and the decor are very unique."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtNHBIaXlBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"""An ode to Bond girl turned interior designer Anouska Hempel"", and therefore quite the spot to find our chimps on ladies night. We swung over to this utopia of sophistication for our fix of pre-dinner cocktails and experienced modern Chinese creations with an emphasis on sustainability.

We loved their signature roast duck as a bar snack on a previous visit, and had returned for a full portion this time. It was therefore disappointing that the duck had sold out even before dinner time. We feel that any self-respecting restaurant should never run out of their signature dish. That is, after all, what many of the customers come for.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNGZid2xnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Chinese fusion food. Servings are good for 4 pax. Enjoyed prawn bonito aioli, wuxi pork ribs, lamb tenderloin and roast duck. Quiet ambience and private seating. Highly recommended and wiuld definitely return"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bG9hMHJnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,Really cozy n beautiful place for nice Chinese fusion food.  Gd portion for ladies to share as well as the soup too. Service is excellent too n thank you for going the extra mile to get us the cake for mini celebration.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLZ0lpZmlnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Food was great. We started with the tomato, it was refreshing, mildly sweet and a little tart, a great way to whet your appetite at the start of the meal. The beef was really really good, topped with fried slices of garlic, roasted like a teppanyaki style. Overall all the dishes were good, overall a very enjoyable range of food. The desserts were not overly sweet, balanced and a great way to leave the meal without feeling too heavy. The service was really good.

The ambience was really nice, modern without being too cold. My only critique is a lack of ambient music to set the mood.

Regarding the service, I guess much of the reviews were from a long time ago, but my experience here was amazing. The staff was attentive and anticipates your needs. We went for a birthday and when we needed the cake, we only needed to look at the staff and the Caucasian staff immediately understood. And even suggested the right portion of desserts for our party. Really appreciate his attitude and level of service. Salute.

Highly recommended place."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhaXNMTklREAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"My second time here. Ordered set meals. It is good at the beginning when portion is small, pretty and fine-diningish. Signature tomatoes is unique and refreshing. Portion becomes bigger towards the end. Pork and fish are good, but there is an apparent lack of creativity in the taste and presentation. It feels the same as what you will get from a good tzi char restaurant. For a restaurant with an ambience like this, I expect more. Just when my friend and I were wondering why the last few dishes came in such big portion and mediocre presentation (and no longer fine dining-ish), the waitress delivered the final nail in the coffin with the final tofu coming in two shockingly big portion for the two of us. Nothing concise or pretty about the dish. By the time the almond tea came, it’s too late to save the day."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc19IYTdBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"Decor is gorgeous if you like a lush moody feel, but the restaurant’s food and service are not worth returning for, unfortunately. We had the beef tenderloin (best dish), roasted duck (skin was good but I’ve had better duck elsewhere), truffle rice (tasted more like risotto but nice), soft shell crab entree and seasonal veg (both no big deal). We were underwhelmed and didn’t order dessert. Food took a while to arrive, perhaps because the restaurant was crowded at 6pm. Service needs more attention as it was uneven. As someone else mentioned in their review, the design of the place also makes it difficult to catch the wait staff’s attention."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaklyR1VBEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,We ordered the set dinner for two... None of the dishes disappointed us... All were good and very rich in flavour... Overall a great meal...
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Z3NUMUl3EAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Had a fantastic breakfast here as part of our staycation. Everything is lovingly made in house from their croissants (SO good!) to their hollandaise and English muffins. The coffee is also excellent. Service was top notch, too, kudos to the kind and professional team! Only regret is we devoured the eggs Benedict before we could take a pic :) it comes with a hearty portion of prosciutto and spinach and was served with perfectly poached eggs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzc2eDF3RRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"A modern asian cuisine - enjoyed the food here! The roasted duck’s skin is super crispy I can’t forget how good it is! The lamb is tender and has a great flavour to it. The Seafood XO fried rice that we ordered was pretty amazing too. The atmosphere was great, pretty private, its a good place for gathering too as they have private section for bigger groups. Would highly recommend if you are into exploring new experiences."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLbl9qRnpRRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,Wonderful modern Chinese cuisine - very private place. Beautifully decorated. Service is very good. The portions are relatively big - so it can be a good sharing set with a group of friends. I personally like their duck cuisines; very tasty.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeHItZzlBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Clad in the striking palette of black, gold and yellow by acclaimed British designer Anouska Hempel, this is one restaurant designed with Instagram in mind.

Helmed by Executive Chef Sebastian Goh who uses only healthy ingredients with no MSG. Our favourite dishes include the braised eggplant, roasted duck and the XO fried rice. Each dish is priced approximately $40, so a meal is roughly $80 per person without drinks.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLLWJTN0RnEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Food was very delicious. Love the ambience. Service was excellent. Shout out to their Duxton Mary, it's the bloody Mary cocktail but way elevated served with a side of really delicious salsa-ish kind of salad where you can eat it separately or chunk everything into the cocktail and drink and still yummy!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2a1B1Y0JBEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,1,Place is nice and classy. Service is  really excellent. Only the food was very disappointing. I hope they will improve on the taste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eTV6SmFREAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,The service was excellent. We were hosted by Ivan who check in regularly with us to see if the food is alright. The dishes we order taste great and the ambience were nice.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bnA2YzVnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"We had a great evening here. Nice food, great ambience. The service is good, staffs are patient and attentive. I like the tender and juicy pork cheek, crispy fish skin! My friends like their spicy Sichuan chicken... thought I requested less spicy, but it still very spicy to me. Btw, it's supposed to taste spicy 😅 so beware if you can't take spicy food. Hmm... feedback, the chicken is not crispy enough. Nothing to shout about on their Crabmeat Ee-fu noodles.
Hmm...Escape to Keifeng is good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUtuTGN3EAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Kannan and his team were attentive to us the whole evening - ensuring that our needs were met and that everything was fine. The food was lovely too. Love the portion size so that we can try a greater variety of food too. However, big eaters may have to order more to fill their stomachs. We enjoyed the barramundi and sea bass as they are different from the usual. We love the kurobuta ribs too - soft, tender and falls off the bone. The children enjoyed the thin udon with tonkatsu broth so much that they were arguing for a second helping :) love the ambience and thank you for accommodating the children!

Thank you for the lovely evening!"

Service was bad, seems like understaff and we had to wait very long before the staff has time to attend to us. Food was so so only, nothing amazing. The duck to me was not very fresh, got a strong frozen duck smell. The rest of the dishes was ok. Considering the service, and food quality, this will be our first and last visit."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NHZEVDJ3RRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Went to YP for dinner last night .The food and the service was almost excellent The Duck ,the scallops ,fried rice and pancakes are fresh and tasty.
The decor and ambience really nice but unfortunately there was a table with 2 ladies and a man stole the show for the night . They were talking so loudly that I think the rest of the diners must be annoyed . They should have dine.in Broadway kopitiam! Hopefully when we come back we will have more considerate diners! No fault of the restaurant ."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMTgzQlhBEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,1,"Between the first dish & white rice served, there was a 20 mins gap before the rest of the dishes came! We had expected much better from a Chinese restaurant in an award-winning establishment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjN2ItYTB3RRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,2,"Had the dim sum lunch buffet today. There were many misses amongst the dishes we ordered.

Pork ribs tasted stale and dry. Very much like they were overcooked and left out for awhile. I need my pork to tear from the bone, soft, succulent and juicy. This was none of that 😣

Pomelo mango sago tasted too much of the packaged mango pudding 😣

Posh interior design and TOP-notch service by the crew today offered some redemption. Very attentive service 👍🏽 lovely place.

We made appointment for the 2nd-seating at 1.15pm. When we arrived at 1.15pm, we were told to “wait on the couch bcos the previous party has not left yet”. There was a time limit to our meal, last order 2.30pm. Not a first good impression. We made the effort to be punctual, could there be a better way to manage the previous patrons from the first seating? Something for the restaurant management to think about. The wait staff’s communication was that they were really helpless.

We also asked for a high chair during reservation but were told to wait, bcos “previous patron was hogging the high chair”. It honestly disappointed me when this mismanagement of the restaurant became a problem cascaded down to me- also a customer of the restaurant. When we left the establishment at 3.15pm, high chair was still not received."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnck9Yal9BRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Great ambience and food. They boast no MSG in their food, even the sauces are made from scratch. Highly recommended items include Beef Tenderloin Cubes and Stir Fried Meesua. Try their cocktails too. They have pretty unique concoctions. More reviews on my IG : @zanthrea."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNmUtZ3ZRRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Amazing Chinese food that's elevated. Great ambience, awesome service, and surprisingly good value.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bzl6bnBBRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,I really enjoyed this place. The food was great the staff was just so nice.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVNFluODdnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,"Very good Chinese food but comes at a hefty price! Portions are small, like tapas servings. Service is good and server was able to recommend/advice dishes and it’s portions to ensure sufficient for our dinner party.

Crispy roast pork belly super yums! Szechuan spicy fried chicken and mee sua highly recommended! Egg plant dish too! Couldn’t think of an average dish as all of awesome!

Perfect for special occasions and suitable for business entertainment as the ambience is very stylish and luxurious.

We came for drinks and small bites one night, and had breakfast here on a separate occasion -- both were wonderful! Food quality was very high and service was attentive, but the absolute highlight was the quality of the cocktails! Very inspired Asian flavour combinations, one of the best bars we've been to in Singapore."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGNQTTNnRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,2,"I just had my dinner last night and the experience was very disappointing. I ordered a 6 course dinner set at 8pm and the pace in which the dishes were served was so bad, the entire experience was ruined. The first 3 dishes came at 30 to 45 mins interval and the last 3 dishes in a burst because ""the kitchen is closing"". Toward the end,  my wife had 3 dishes on the table. How is this a fine dining experience?"

Noise level was not. Private room partitions are those flimsy Chinese screens which are not floor to ceiling and neither are they sound proof.

Food was disappointing for the price we paid. Food lacks the ‘omph’ factor. I would describe them as flat, bland and/ or spicy. As a local, you can get way better food at this price in a good Chinese restaurant, with good sound proofing. Most of the dishes we ordered are on the recommendations list. Imagine if we ordered the non recommended ones.

The best dish was the starter, Chilled Organic Vine-ripened Tomatoes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLcmFDZG9BRRAB,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,3,"There are some dishes taste ok but in general very salty. The most disappointing part is the service. The waitress ladies look extremely confused, multiple different staff randomly dropped by asking random questions such as “any of you ordered beer?” seriously... The tea tasted really bad. Really a horrible pot of tea honestly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ0wtRU9nEAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,4,The crispy Sichuan chicken is nice! Good ambience
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5OTZibFBREAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"Great service and ambience. The duck and the beef tenderloin was very nice. I thought the enoki was something different, like a spiced snack which is q nice. The mee sua is also beautiful. Not a fan of the lion mane mushroom and avocado even though it was recommended."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNejkzUU1REAE,Yellow Pot Tanjong Pagar,5,"I find the interior of this place beautiful because it is decorated in gold and black with pleasant ambiance. Best place for small group gathering of friends or family. Food is very delicious, we love the roast duck and the sweet and sour eggplant the most. The portion is generous and guaranteed that you will enjoy every bit. Excellent service by friendly staff. This place deserves a five-star rating."

The sliced fish in chili oil was thickly coated in cornstarch. The knive cut noodles are decent but needed more salt."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjblpDRElBEAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,5,"After so many years, silkroad has managed to maintain its standard. The Peking duck was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Superb!

Dec 2021 - Nth time at silk road
Tried the cod for the first time. Not bad. Smooth. Will try again

Dec 2021 (again!) - scallops asparagus not as spicy as I hoped for but still good. Wasabi prawn with potato crisps were great! Half chicken was juicy and not dry. Love."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTdWNYRDh3RRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,5,"Great service, observant and meticulous. They took note and very careful with our special dietary order.

Great food with affordable price, generous portion too.

Classy ambience however noise from kitchen is a bit loud.

Vegetarian friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeWRtQkVREAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,4,Food is great and cosy restaurant setting. Attentive staff however they are pretty understaffed. Hopefully they will increase staff again now that it’s all opening up. We enjoyed the snowflake dumping and assorted mushroom dishes the most.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcE9pSXhRRRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,3,"You need to call to order their peking duck in advance. Other dishes are just average, peking duck is not the best in sg too. But good option for less crowded and mainstream restaurant for big group dining.

-1 for the staff always asking us to top up and end up over ordering."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLZ3FqdWJBEAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,5,"Fantastic service. Ordered Dan Dan Mian, Sichuan  chilli chicken and prawns. Great ambience and rates are very reasonable. Total value for money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnc05hTHZ3RRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,5,"A quiet cosy place for authentic Chinese food. Personally, I find their mapo toufu is one of the best with good silky toufu and really good spicy sauce. As I asked for original flavor  and spicineess, I really experienced that spicky kick that made my forehead break into sweat on a cold rainy evening. A bit pricey but with the good quality food, I will definitely be back to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bzU2M3BRRRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,4,We come here for CNY reunion lunch every year. The food items taste good. The prawns are exorbitant in prices but I guess it’s the same for all seafood items in Chinese restaurants during cny. I would have given this full marks if not for the Nian Gao. It’s not fried and it taste very sweet and strange. I find the mango sago very sweet as well. Service is good as usual!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlb2Q3QXJ3RRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,1,"Went for team get together, booked VIP room, tried multiple dishes there, but none of them are so good except prawn and mushroom..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvX3BMM2xRRRAB,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,4,We've been here twice now. They serve a tasty range of Sichuan/Chinese fare including dim sum. I recommend their Sichuan-spiced roasted chicken. Note that some dishes can be extremely garlicky. Prices are decent for a hotel restaurant.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMUo2MGJBEAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,4,"Located on the second floor of Amara Hotel, this restaurant serves enjoyable SzeChuan food. The spiciness of the food is moderate, and the starters are quite good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcmV5OE5REAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,4,"This is the most authentic mapo doufu I have tasted in singapore. However, The Peking duck is rather bland and the skin is not even crispy. The only highlight of the duck dish is the sauce and the wrap which are both made by the chef delicately. I think Singapore does not have the real Peking ducks to be purchased."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaE9hOUpnEAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,1,"Was having a business lunch there on Friday, 30th September. There were about 8 to 10 tables occupied but only 1 service staff. They were severely short-staffed, which resulted in slow to almost no service."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtOFpEZE53EAE,Silk Road Restaurant - Amara Singapore,1,"Went for the $88 pp CNY Lunch, at first they asked us to come earlier even though they had a booking slot for 2pm available on Chope, then when we got there, they were rushing dishes out so as to get us out of the restaurant ASAP. Together with the horrible customer service from the lady manager where she was rude, aggressive and unwilling to serve us, the lo hei/ yu sheng ended up giving the entire family food poisoning! I would honestly, not recommend anyone go back for their CNY Lunch or Dinner services if this is how they treat their customers on Chinese New Year"

I visited again last dinner because it was very delicious, the atmosphere was good and the appetizers and soup had particularly delicate tastes so I visited again. As always, delicious appetizer and shark fin soup. Other fish dishes and mapo beans were eaten, but they were too spicy to be honest. People who like spicy foods will surely be delicious. The small basket parcel was delicious, and the dessert mango pudding was delicious with a novel texture. Lunch course is $ 48 per person. It is always recommended for some reason.

Very delicious and good atmosphere and service. We had a fish course, but everything was delicious.

前回ディナーでお邪魔して凄く美味しかったし、雰囲気も良く前菜とスープが特に繊細な味をしていたので再訪。相変わらず美味しい前菜とフカヒレのスープ。その他お魚料理と麻婆豆腐食べましたが辛すぎて正直耐えれなかった。辛いものが好きな人はきっとめっちゃ美味しいんでしょうけど。小籠包は普通に美味しく、デザートのマンゴープリンは斬新な食感で美味しかった。お昼のコースは一人48ドル。何故かいつもそんな混んでないしオススメです。

めっちゃ美味しいし雰囲気もサービスも良い。お魚コースを頂きましたが何を食べても美味しかった。"

There is also a private room for up to 10 people so you can enjoy it in groups.

Food in general was very tasty, though you may feel thirsty later in the day. Portioning is adequate. Pricing was fair. Decor is a little on the old side. Parking can be a slight challenge but manageable."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdlBHenVRRRAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,5,"Delicious, authentic, hearty Hong Kong style dish and dim sum, a rare gem in the city.

The baked egg yolk bun is an absolute gem, and don't miss the abalone sauce braised rice and crispy skin roast piglet. All dishes I ordered  taste spot on, quite a statement for the skill of the chef.

The decor feels oldish and the service is not as good as those fancy looking, Michelin star bearing places, but the food here tastes as good or better without the pretentiousness. It is a place where I crash into alone after work, or bring my friends to, but not for treating my business partner with fancy wine.

Sitting here I feel I'm in one of those neighborhood favorite restaurants in Hong Kong or in some Chinatown in the US with comforting dependable delicious food, what else do I want in a restaurant?"

The highlight of the meal was the liu sha bao. 1 of the best I had ever eaten - the skin is polo bun style - very thin and a bit crispy, the filling overflowing when we bit into it... Chilli crab bun was nice too.
Surprisingly, all their vegetarian dishes were made very well too. And good value."

We had our lunch here and its very crowded almost full ( we make reservations 1 few days before)

They offer dim sum & ala carte .
The Peking duck with two ways eat is nice , meat alots in noodle.

The dim sum Cream of salted egg york bun is yummy , different from the normal buns outside, highly recommend.

Overall is good , can come and try out."

We have not visited Mouth Restaurant 地茂馆 for a few years now and decided to go for there for our late breakfast today.

The ‘wok hei’ Yuan Yang Hor Fun was quite flavourful and some of their dim sum dishes were superb and delicious.  The serving staff were friendly and quick in their service.

Some popular dim sum dishes include the Rainbow Har Gao, Squid Ink Char Siew Bao and Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bao 流沙包…all yummy! 👍👍👍"

Near to CNY, the restaurant only offers CNY menu sets that consist of 6-7 dishes .
The set menu was meant for 3-4 pax. Honestly , the dishes is more than enough for 4 adults . If you like Chinese food, overall , the food is not bad, typical traditional Chinese food. Damage close to $100 per pax (included GST and service charge)"

Brought my parents here for dim sum with chope 30% off vouchers. The food are great. I like their stir fried carrot cake with xo sauce and salted egg custard bao . Their dim sum are simple and great too. The tea is expensive (3sgd per pax).

However do note that they have a rest time at 2.30 pm so try to come earlier before 2.30pm as it will be the last order before the restaurant take a break."

Orders Patin fish, Trio eggs spinach, Scallion chicken and Ee fu noodles.
Most of the dishes were tasty and were up to standard. Ee fu noodles were fragrant, fish was fresh and chicken was well done and tender. The spinach could be improved though. A little bland. Soup was not thick enough.

The meat is not inclusive, need another add-on of another dish in price range of another $10-$28) to get the meat dish. That was what was explained by staff/manager as stated in the menu. Usually, one would paid for the entire duck and another token sum for the meat to be cooked separately - which is acceptable. In any case, the Peking duck taste and presentation is below average (see pic). Would have given a 1-star if not for other dishes which tasted better and more value-for-money. Think there are better options and rational restaurants out there."

Too tempting. Forgot to take a photo before eating. The crispy noodles with seafood was great. Not oily at all. Spinach in superior broth was ok. Loved the homemade tofu with mushroom. Peking duck was ok. They wrapped it for you so by the time you eat it, it's not as crispy as it should have been."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMGFMSFB3EAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,3,"I'll give closer to 3.5 stars. The food is tasty (sorry we eat 1st take pic later), but portion is on the small side. Average $6 for 3 pieces of dim sum. Service is slow due to large amount of folks there. Table flow generally quite fast cause staff are quite prompt in clearing tables.
Go to their website to purphase a $99 voucher for free peking duck.
Molten salted egg lava bun is fantastic.
Fish maw is not tasty. Didn't soak up the broth."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdU9maVV3EAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,5,"My husband found us a $50 cash voucher for the price of $35 on Chope (valid between 11:30am-12:00pm Mondays-Friday). Timeline was tight but we were in the area so it worked out. *Note: We were informed the voucher would work for everything on the menu except the Peking duck platters.*

We arrived around noon on a Thursday. It was busy but we were able to get a table without making a reservation ahead of time. The food was pretty good. The har gow, siew mai, xiao long bao, bbq pork buns were all really tasty! Some of their dishes were on the saltier end - especially the chicken feet. The custard lava buns were really delicious! It was a lovely blend of pineapple bun exterior with custard filling on the inside.

I was really impressed with their service. Our cups were continuously re-filled before it was even empty! Our plates were changed about 2-3 times to ensure we had a clean plate for whatever dish we were having. So thoughtful!

The only thing that caught me off guard was we had to pay to pack the leftovers. This wasn’t AYCE so it was strange to me that it would cost $1/item to pack things to-go. This has never happened to me in the history of dining out."
ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLN3E5cxAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,4,"The place is convenient located at street level. There is a big open carpark which is only about 100m away. They served dim sum lunch. The place is not very big so need prior reservation to avoid disappointment. There are various types of dim sum for selection and also some ala carte dishes. The seafood crispy noodles and the clay pot tofu with scallops were very good. The char siu with roast duck were done very well. The har gao, siew mai, xiao long bao and the rest were equally great."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPODl2Q09nEAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,1,"Had dinner tonight during Father's Day in the restaurant. Was surprised that the quality of food in Mouth restaurant had deteriorated so much since a few years ago. All the dishes are tasteless, suppose all my overseas guests are utterly disappointed with the food. Mouth restaurant used to have excellent food in the past and it is a pity to see them in such a state now. I think the Management of Mouth restaurant should address such poor quality and improve."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM29McWd3RRAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,4,"Took my mom and a few other family members for their dim sum tea on a Sunday afternoon.

I've been here before a while back (used to bring clients here) and dim sum is still the same quality. For those coming here for the first time, expect quite an old-school Chinese interior with service provided by a body of older staff - food still came pretty fast.

We ordered the Har Gao (standard quality - shrimp is pretty fresh), Beancurd Roll (a tad too elastic and starchy for me, but my mom thought it was good), Xiao Long Bao (nice healthy mouthfuls with very delicate skin - fair quality and taste for at $5.40 per basket of 3), Beef Brisket Congee (very smooth congee, and very soft beef - better than the generic lean pork century egg congee), Char Siew Chee Cheong Fun (I prefer the ones at Tim Ho Wan, the skin is smoother and char siew is of better quality), half an Irish Roasted Duck (fantastic crispy skin with well-roasted fats), Asparagus stir-fried with Scallops (no photos, ate it too fast!) and salted egg yolk buns for dessert (these come baked in a delicious thin crust and loads of filling).

I gave it only 4 stars out of 5 because they only informed us the Irish duck was not included under the Chope Voucher promo (we paid $35 per $50 voucher, basically 30% discount) only after we had ordered everything (and we declared we were using the vouchers right from get go) and was midway through the dim sum, despite the T & C's in the Chope Vouchers stating that all a la carte menu items were included in the promo. I did feedback to the staff at the end of the meal that this is something they can improve upon, and chose to use only 2 out of 3 Vouchers I had prepared for this meal instead.

4 adults and 1 child (who ate as much as the adults) cost us around $140 with a value of $170.

Will just have to come back for the Xiao Long Bao and the Salted Egg Yolk buns!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNnZybmtnRRAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,4,"Food was good especially the peking duck.  Beef was tender and tasty. Dim sum was just normal and expensive at about 5.xx per basket.  If there is no promotion,  don't think is worth for the price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGMtV1ZREAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,1,"Service was okay, that’s the saving grace.

We went on a Saturday night, and there’s not more than 10 tables of diners inside.

Ordered the Peking Set, and seriously disappointed.

The Peking ducks were so-so.
Chilli crab didn’t taste like
chilli crab, tasted like tomato sauce crab.
Steamed live grouper, was just okay. Fish was half the size of the plate though.
The Ee-Fu noodles…. Tasted like Char Kway Tiao…. Tasted like noodles stir fried with sweet sauce…"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLalp6VUN3EAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,4,"Good staff attitude! They are approachable, and even go for the extra mile! My last dish was Sheng Mee before snow fungus dessert. As I was already full, I asked for Sheng Mee to be packeted. The staff came back with 2 separate pack of the Sheng Mee and the gravy, this ensures the tastefulness even consuming it hours later.
The dishes are fresh and well cooked, with condiments nicely sparkled.
Worth considering coming back for another great meal"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbko2OU53EAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,1,"Expensive but tasteless, low quality food.
Stir fried carrot cake with xo sauce- just deep fried carrot cake, while the egg and bean sprouts were cooked separately, then placed together.
E-fu noodles was terrible as well. $15.80 for noodles with mushroom and a few pcs of spring onion. No meat whatsoever. Tasteless too. Feel so cheated.
Will definitely not return."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MmNYZE1REAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,4,Had dim sum lunch here. Overall food and services was good but was disappointed by 12pm no more roast pork as they have limited quantity. Better to make reservation and inform them in advance if you wan roast pork.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyajZub3F3RRAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,1,"Thought of celebrating Mother’s Day one week earlier, to avoid the mad rush. Booked 12.30 for 19 pax & the set to be served . However, we waited outside the restaurant for more than half an hour.. and possibly an hour if we didn’t approach them for a few times. When we told them that it is past the appointment time for 10 min, they said  ten more min . Then 20 min passed, they ignored us and we approached them again. They said another 10 min. when we showed our displeasure . There are 2 young children and a 85 year old lady waiting outside..hot and hungry. Then they said they already rushed the table of 10 who is almost done ..but they just took out their birthday cake and took lots of pictures and have not even cut cake ..means likely at least another 20 minutes to clear the table.. so means by 1.30 pm we will get our lunch..appt is 12.30.. then what’s the point of making reservation . Instead of rushing the table of guests who “overstayed”, they asked us to continue to wait. Asked for the manager. She said it’s like that ..just wait for a while, she started raising her voice at us when we told her not to continue to let us wait for so long, and just brushed us apart . Then she finally stormed off and returned to put us in a VIP room. Though f"

Drunken prawn soup no herbal taste, a lot of MSG taste
The red bean soup that came with it is very starchy"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXaF9xa25RRRAB,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,5,"First time here for their dim sum, and really enjoyed our meal. The staff are very welcoming and attentive, and food was really good too! Highly recommend ordering the flaky egg tarts and dumplings in spicy vinegar. The liu sa pau was also great (note that the bun is in crumbly pastry form, not soft bread pau). Will definitely return!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpak9leWVnEAE,Mouth Restaurant - 地茂馆,5,"One of my fav Cantonese restaurant to go to,  pity they have left with the last branch at Maxwell now. Go support them 👍"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2d05ldkRnEAE,Kia Hiang,3,"Ordered quite a few dishes to share but the only memorable dish for me was their signature claypot chicken. The staff also took the wrong order for our soup.

The mapo tofu was shocking as the tofu pieces were so big and it wasn't spicy at all. The eggplants were also a disappointment as they were not diced and it was tough in the middle and not flavoured enough."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycjRUcnpBRRAB,Kia Hiang,4,"Nice old school ambience with friendly staff members.

The best dish was the piping hot claypot spring chicken, and I thought the claypot sliced garoupa was not bad as well. Both dishes went great with rice!

However, the dimsum completely fell flat of expectations and one can easily get better dimsum at most commercialized chains. The steamed coconut with egg white and peach resin was quite underwhelming, with the smell of the egg overpowering just about everything."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxb09hNkt3EAE,Kia Hiang,4,"Tasty old school Chinese food. Do try the hotplate tofu, cabbage braised chicken which pairs excellently with rice. Give the dimsum a miss."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5MkxPa29nRRAB,Kia Hiang,5,"This place is still around after so many years.
So much history so much memory on this place. Goes to show the food is still worth coming back for. The current owner took over, without changing the menus. International Plaza has been thru so much revamp, but this restaurant, the taste is still great as ever. The chicken, beef was really good. The current service staff is so polite & attentive. Give it a try if you are in the vicinity."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld0lxRGFREAE,Kia Hiang,5,"Been lunching / dining here for the past 10 years, very yummy food especially the chicken and never disappoints! This is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurant around!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBOW9ia2dnRRAB,Kia Hiang,5,"Did not expect their specialty dish ""Claypot chicken"" was so delicious that bought back my old memories of home cooked food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaFphbkF3EAE,Kia Hiang,5,"Been here a couple of times, most returning almost weekly. The claypot chicken is one of their signature and defo worth trying, hotplate beancurd with egg and chinglong vege with beansprouts are yummy great too. Also try the bbq pork bun! I like that portion sizes are reasonable and food comes relatively fast. It also has a nice homemade feel to it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdzlidVl3EAE,Kia Hiang,4,"Never thought that we could find such a gem at international plaza. Kia hiang serves really good traditional chinese food, even my korean colleagues love this place. Must try their claypot chicken, its superb!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyNHBtY05nEAE,Kia Hiang,4,"Difficult to find a local restaurant. They have some awards for the chicken that was super tender, but we loved the dim sum (shitake&truffle was amazing) there."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMXBHUTBRRRAB,Kia Hiang,5,"Three of us went there yesterday for lunch. Contrary to what some reviewers said, we found the service good. The set lunch for three is more than enough for three adult males. The popular signature dishes are indeed very tasty and the dessert Oni is one of the best we have tried."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaDZLQUtnEAE,Kia Hiang,5,"A surprising find, located in a nondescript 2nd floor. We ordered one of the set lunches which represents good value. Their signature Chicken claypot was soft to the bone which was flavoursome. Carrot cake had a slight crisp, Steamed gourd with fish was moist, I wish they sliced the cuttlefish thinner for ease of enjoyment. Tofu was also cooked perfectly.
Siew Mai, Thickened soup and Braised pork rib were pedestrian
Overall the dishes were well executed and homey in taste. The dining room had a poor acoustic effects so it is annoying during peak period."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHejUyRVRnEAE,Kia Hiang,5,"Kia Hiang has been around for 30 plus years and its specialties are chicken wrapped in cabbage and braised in a claypot, a dry hotplate toufu that's like a toufu omelette, and bean sprouts with salted fish.
Kia Hiang recently added dim sum to the menumenu"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTb29xdWVBEAE,Kia Hiang,5,Used to go once every couple of weeks because that claypot chicken + omelette combo is like no other. Testament to the food and chef that the restaurant is still going strong after nearly two decades in the corner of a nondescript building. It gets packed.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeWRURG1RRRAB,Kia Hiang,4,"This place proves that if you product is excellent, you don't need customer service. lol
The claypot chicken is a must try. Even my picky dad loves it.
But be prepared to be treated by little children by the staff!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvX3Y3YTh3RRAB,Kia Hiang,1,"Ridiculous rules about no seating before everyone arrived - even though we offered to order and start eating first and the restaurant was not even halfway full. Stubborn and rude staff who refuse to budge - guess they prefer to have 0 customers over even just 2?

Overall, food and service quality have been declining over the past few years - waiting times for food grow longer, orders get messed up, and tables get ignored or have their order sheet misplaced entirely."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcW9ET213RRAB,Kia Hiang,5,Food is really nice especially their famous claypot spring chicken with cabbage! Service was awesome! Really good place to bring your family here!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNU9MSHJ3RRAB,Kia Hiang,1,"My friend went to the restaurant earlier to have seat inside while waiting for my lunch time.

The staff just told him straight in face that if all the customer wait like you, die lo! Wish a very harsh tone and loud that every diners around could hear. And keep on staring at him as if he got no money to eat and wasting their space for siting there and wait for me to come to order.

If were you, what do you think?

When I'm in the restaurant,  while eating. A group of office personal having their lunch and their last course is Yam paste. They requested for 2 small bowls bt in the end they didn't use it. The staff while clearing the table after they left, say very loudly that ""WA GET 2 BOWLS FROM ME AND NEVER USE""!!!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX2FhWkxnEAE,Kia Hiang,5,Provide Very traditional Chinese food. Take away offer is so worth and delicious.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbEwzYTN3RRAB,Kia Hiang,2,"Waiting 45 min for our food, which then took less than 5 min to cook up after they realised we were forgotten. Tastes good, but fairly expensive for what it is, so probably consider if you have time to waste before coming here."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJdjhyR21RRRAB,Kia Hiang,3,"Claypot hicken is nice. The rest not much a fancy , other zhichar can do much better. Very noisy not a place to have some conversations over lunch"

Doesn't warrant a second visit at all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLcW9ER2p3RRAB,Kia Hiang,5,Food is served hot and fast! Excellent service! Great place to celebrate occasions. Friendly staff and bosses
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3NElpUnB3RRAB,Kia Hiang,4,"I shared the Tofu Omelette, Claypot Chicken and Sambal Kang Kong with two others over lunch.
It was just about right, leaning on the side where the portions were a little big. I liked the tofu omelette, it came out smelling of a really hot wok and was cooked just right, perhaps a little overcooked inside. Kang Kong tasted good. Important that the Kang Kong is young and texture not chewy. Now, onto the the restaurant's famous Claypot Chicken - chicken was well cooked through with meat falling off the bones, the cabbage was memorable, just one those good things that came with the claypot dish that completes it. Wish they had some mushrooms in the dish as it would have been complimentary to the chicken. The sauce which all of this sat in, is where I hesitate to say is really anything fantastic. It was a mild savory sauce that felt like watered down mix of Oyster sauce, soy sauce, etc. But I'd still go ahead and recommend this place to others as I think it's a basics no frills food place. Could the food be better? Of course, but its good enough to fix a hungry 3 people on a Saturday."

Shrimp chili sauce is moderately sweet and spicy with excellent taste. And the shrimp are quite firm.

During the 25mins waiting there, I have noticed the hygiene standard at the restaurant was very poor.
Food was salty, oil and full of msg."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJaTRHU3lnRRAB,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,5,We order lunch from here about once every 2 weeks and everyone loves it. The spiciness is just right and well the taste is as best it can get.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3czVxZkFREAE,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,1,"Went twice so far. The service really sucked. They are also severely short-handed - only 2 person running the whole place. Tried their buffet on our second visit and was told that every dish could only be ordered once. Okay...so we made our order, and was then told we cannot order the same type of meat twice? Excuse me? 😡 Their definition of “buffet” is ridiculous, and the buffet price is unreasonable with this kind of funny limitation...In the end we had to order something else, which was not delicious at all. Yucks..."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNVpHeVZnEAE,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,5,One of my favorite Chinese restaurant in the town. Cheap and delicious

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBMkpfWm9nRRAB,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,5,Excellent service. The spicy lamb is something to die for. Cooked just right with the right chewiness and spiciness.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRN0xEbXBRRRAB,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,3,"This is a Hunan Cuisine restaurant. As you know about Hunan cuisine, the dish will be extremely spicy. Space arrangement is weird as it sits in one of the corner and not much room for large group gathering. I think this serves the basic need for you to try out a spicy Hunan cuisine."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbWVITjN3RRAB,The Xiang Pavilion 国色天湘 （ Guo Se Tian Xiang ）,4,"Hot and spicy fish  and stir fry yellow beef. Wonderful, spicy but not the extreme."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXd2ZQXzdBRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,Tucked away in a corner on the second floor of the building. Not a big space but a wide menu of Teochew and Hainanese Food. What we ordered was delicious. The lady serving us was super friendly. Thumbs up!
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPME5fTzh3RRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,"Tucked in a quiet corner on the 2nd level next to Tanjong Pagar hawker center, it is many times ""Out of sight, out of mind"" in its location.
After reading many positive reviews, I ordered a deep fried fish with rice.
The soup was added with milk and a  generous amount of deep fried egg, seaweed, tomato and leafy greens. Soup was good though not outstanding. 5 pieces of deep fried fish nuggets which were still piping hot. More crusty and it had a larger batter than the fish slice. Couldn't tell much of the fish type.
Aircon seating filled quickly but the  service is quick and friendly as they will try to get you a table at the outdoor (large fans were observed).
For the price, it is reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaE56dFdREAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Value-for-money Quick-Lunch menu, Hainanese Pork Chop rice at $6 nett. The pork was tender and lean, with good portion size for the price. Sauce was a bit too sweet for me. Plus points for the friendly service and clean environment."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc3A3ZjF3RRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,"Ordered the Stir-Fry Kang Kong and Marmite Chicken. Both dishes were yummy. The chilli, both belacan and sweet and sour were nice.  Service was superb! Friendly lady. :)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa05hWUZnEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Mixed fish soup (default comes with milk) was a hearty substantial bowl. Felt full even without adding rice or noodles. Soup and batang was as expected but fried fish was exceptionally good, light batter and huge chunks. Not sure what fish was used though, dory? Fish soup purists may automatically opt for the traditional batang soup but I'd say give the mixed one a try! Chilli with garlic also seemed homemade and was very good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2alliVENBEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Yummy Teochew eatery on 2nd floor of Tanjong Pagar Plaza. The indoors space is tight, but extra tables have been set up outside and it’s quite comfortable / breezy place to eat. Will return !"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlME52eDR3RRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Lots of choices to choose from. Tried the fried fish soup and it was very tasty. Fish is served separately in a bowl so it does not come soggy and soft. Also tried the fish meat white bee hoon. Freshly cooked and hot, very good. Will come again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhdHJfcFJBEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Hidden gem on the second floor of Tanjong Pagar Plaza. I wouldn’t have known of this place if it weren’t for a friend’s recommendation. Pork Chop Egg Fried Rice ($8) is great! Rice is fluffy and separated, pork chop is just nice, and chili is the real hero. Will definitely come again to try the other stuff!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNHFycFJnEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,Sliced fish soup was very authentic!!! Soup tasted nice and nutritious! Price was reasonable.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNTVyYmhBRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,Friendly staff and tasty food! Sesame chicken is the best😋
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPa2QzNU9nEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"second time here. the lady (probably the owner/family of owner) definitely has what it takes to run the biz. very friendly, and engages all her customers that she serves. she even sensed that i might have been uncomfortable sitting at the smaller table and gave us a bigger one without me askingg. i appreciate that gesture. food is good and reasonably priced too. definitely will come back again to try other dishes."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPdnZpYjBnRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,"I packed dinner back. The dishes are simply delicious.

The Mixed fish Tom yum soup was nice, fish hor fun was tasty, and the fried rice with pock chop was simply good enough to fill m6 teenage son's food cravings."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlX0xTRTNnRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,So many ranges of good and tasty foods to select. Need to wait for at least 15-20mins. But it is worth waiting.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNheU96elJBEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,3,"Situated at level 2 and beside the tanjong pagar food centre, one can find the store tucked to the left of the food centre. The food here is slightly more  pricey than the food centre but it is nice!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMWV6ejB3RRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"The food and service are good!

The owner prioritises the customers’ needs. For instance, we ordered an extra bowl of rice and the owner said to finish our food first and there’s no rush to pay. It’s really small actions like this that elevates the entire service level!

We tried the batang fish steamboat, marmite Chicken, furong omelette, minced meat tofu! All of the dishes are super nice! The prices are reasonable too!

Strongly recommend!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpN3R5QWpRRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,"Very pleasant eatery, run by ultra-friendly husband-and-wife team, offers wide array of local delights.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNjhlQ2FnEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"A new find for the family and what a surprise find! Delicious fresh Authentic food @ affordable prices. Dishes to try include the steamboat, har cheong Kai, prawn rolls fried pork! They may be opening a stall soon in Aljunied so hit them up there as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaklXdWhRRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,"Felt the pricing is quite steep. Have to pay 80cents more for milk, and add on for rice/noodles. Taste is above average, and people pay more for the ambience and ease of finding seats. Prawn rolls are good though as a side dish. My colleague tried hor fun and it also felt quite ordinary."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwejQyT0JREAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,4,Good hearty bowl of fish soup with bitter gourd. A hidden gem  unknown to many except for those working in the area. Sides were good too. Fish was a little stiff based on my visit but the crowd certainly didn't think so (very crowded during lunch)
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdXRfZUFREAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,3,"Food was acceptable, aircon environment welcomed in this hot weather. Pricing wise a little on the high side considering a Hawker centre is right beside with similar food choices."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdjdQQkZBEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,Very delicious and simple teochew cuisine ! Prices are cheap and good ! A must try is their signature teochew mixed soup with fish egg 🤤Been coming here quite frequently for it 😎but do call in advance to check if there is stock for fish egg.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNC1tOHhRRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"nice fish and seafood soup, reasonably priced"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya2RpX2xRRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"There are few places that have fish head steamboat. Of these few places there are even lesser that do not use msg. Here, the soup is without msg but taste good due to the quality of the stock used. Recommended if you love fish and non msg"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcUtyQ2VnEAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,Batang fish soup is great! Fresh fish and flavourful soup. Small serving serves at most 2 pax imo.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNZ2FXMy1nRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,3,Uncommon to find this type of fish soup in Singapore. It contained the type of salty flavour that should be from dried white amur (i guess). The fish they use in their fish soup is the typical spanish mackerel (batang).
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXX0xDbGNREAE,The Teochew Kitchenette,3,"Situated in a nice quiet location. Shop abit small.

It’s not very expensive nor very cheap. The fish head soup is abit of bland side though it means no msg too. Fish is quite fresh too.

I don’t feel very strongly about it…can come can don’t come."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHajZiSWh3RRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"My family loves this place, we come here around 5-6 times a year especially on cold nights.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0Z0lUU3FnRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"The fish is one of the freshest I've eaten. Pricing is reasonable. Eating fish steamboat or cray pot curry fish head in aircon area, best!"

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5amFpTy1RRRAB,The Teochew Kitchenette,5,"Friendly service, affordable prices. A great choice in town! :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla051dTRRRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Love it!
I just got back from Jeju and was missing Tangsuyuk so much. Not black pork but I enjoyed the dish so much. $53 for Tangsuyuk, Mandu, Jjamppong & Jjajiangmyeon (SET A)
Bonus is that they have baijiu and also Korean alcohol available."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MUsyMER3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Wow I have never came across this restaurant even though I have walked past it without noticing it so many times until a Korean friend recommended me this restaurant.
I am usually a Korean cuisine person and not so much on Korean-Chinese but this restaurant totally proofed me wrong that Korean-Chinese can be very good too!
I walked in it just felt so Korean I believe there were a lot of Koreans dining there. I was brought into the corner room where the other 2 tables were also Koreans. I was thinking to myself this place must be good and authentic!
Went with my gut feeling to pick a set and added a Kimchi pancake. Food was served pretty promptly and smelled good.
The dumplings was hot and crispy, very enjoyable. Then came the kimchi pancake and the jajiangmyeon. Am pretty surprised the portion was rather generous thank God we got enough people to finish everything.
Jajiangmyeon is definitely the best I have eaten in Singapore, the sauce is so good and not salty at all. 2 of us shared the jajiangmyeon and we were quite full already didn't really we still had the Jjamppong. Soup was not really spicy and it was very delicious. Didn't know why after the meal my lips felt like it was burning. Forgot about the main star of the meal which I thought was the sweet and sour pork. Wow the sauce is so good, so mild but has the essential flavours and taste.
Really enjoyable meal here definitely will make it to the often visit list!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dzhxdUhBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"The food is delightful and outstanding. We highly recommend three must-try dishes that are great for sharing: Sweet & Sour Pork, Seafood & Vegetable Salad Platter with Mustard Sauce, and Jjam Bong (spicy seafood noodle soup).

Ambience wise, this is not the most stylish restaurant, but is cosy and evokes an old world feel which we liked.

Tip: Make a reservation for the window seats which feels cosier and more enjoyable with views to the sidewalk."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXc01HZkdnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,3,"Portions are hearty, kimchi and other small side dishes can be refilled. Not quite used to Korean style of Chinese dishes, taste OK But no wow factors."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLXN6cnZBRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"Tried the Dried Black Soy Bean Sauce Noodle (간짜장면) aka Dry Jjajangmyeon. Find it much better than the usual jjajangmyeon, less oily to my preference. The noodle is spongy and chewy. To go with that, we also ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork (탕수육). Very good! For some unknown reasons, these 2 dishes combo always appeared in korean dramas, especially after they moved house. If you like something for a change, go for the Seafood & Vegetable Platter with Mustard (양장피). Its like the CNY ""Loh hei"", just that you are mixing and tossing thinly sliced, fresh vegetables and seafood with potato starch noodles instead."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5LVpueGNREAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,Hwang Sil is a great place for Korean-style Chinese comfort food. Their noodle dishes are nice and the mains come in a range of sizes. They also have quite a few combos and set menus that include the most popular dishes. I recommend trying the kkanpunggi (깐풍기). The sweet and sour pork (탕수육) is also good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXNHRQaXlRRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Visited the place for two times, and still amazed by how well-executed the noodles were!!! The noodles got a nice chew and very tasty! Most of the customers visited during lunch hour were Korean! I recommend Jjamppong the most!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbHRubkpnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"A favourite of mine for jjangmyeon (blackbean sauce noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) - which go very well together.

Fans of kkanpunggi (spicy garlic fried chicken) may also like to try that here; I like it although some may mot as it is slightly less crispy than other places but the seasoning is great.

Have not tried their other dishes to comment on them but an overall great place for a nice simple dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXdHVlQkFnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"The tansuyuk and jajangmyeon here is good no doubt, just feels a little bit pricey. For a little better value, get one of their sets! E.g. set A includes dumplings, tangsuyuk, 2x mains like jajangmyeon or jjampong for $53 (before service charge and GST)"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHN2RXMkxnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"The jajangmyun compared to the other korean noodle shops is a lot more wet and less greasy. A good balance of sweet and savory, with a handful of onions and pork belly cubes. Noodles were chewy and didn't have an alkaline smell.

Tangsuyok ordered for Small is more than enough for 2 pax. They are in bite sized chunks instead of long streaks which was easier to eat. Batter is crispy and not too thick.

Texture of chives pancake was thin and lightly crispy. It is easily torn with chopsticks and still has a chewy stretchy texture. Can imagine eating this with alcohol as an accompaniment.

Condiments such as kimchi, yellow radish, onion bits and szechuan veggie were given in small portions.👍 And water is complimentary. Ambience was very much like an atas korean-Chinese restaurant :)

Total bill came up to be ~$72 and would say its towards the high side."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dDRPallnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"Went as recommended by my Korean colleague for Jjajangmyeon. First taste on Jjajangmyeon is not too smoky like OBBA or sweet like Mukjia. Noodles is in between Itaewon’s and OBBA. Find that smaller size onions taste better but here is bigger slice. The minced pork here is bigger in size and not so dry as compared to the other restaurants mentioned above. The sauce here is most watery of the 4.
For the fried dumplings, I must recommend. The skin is akin to biscuit taste n the fillings is good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHM1BEd1Z3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Seafood jjumpong is very delicious, strongly recommend. Visited few times never disappointed. Another dish that impressed is spicy jellyfish salad, really yummy."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPeHB6VnpBRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,2,Disappointing. This place was good and had recommended it to many people but the standard has dropped significantly. Jjajangmyeon didn't taste right - lack the sweet and salty balance - just tasted like a bowl of noodles with no purpose. Tangsuyuk tasted like how it was then but the sauce was too liquid like dipping into water. Itaewon Jjajang down the street might be a better consideration for those who want authentic Korean jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3V6dU9nEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Jjamppong(짬뽕) and raw beef(육회) are the best in Singapore.
Other menus are also above average."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX01XMEh3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Best Ja jiang myeon I’ve eaten! A little pricey but definitely worth the extra few dollars for authentic Korean food.
We had to wait 30min for a seat and when we entered, we were the only Chinese in the restaurant! Well patronized by Koreans.. had to be good!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXdVozMmhnRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,2,"Safety Warning!
Foods were good, but their chairs were broken yet they decided still to use them (multiple broken chairs), which caused blackspot bruise injury to my index finger immediately. When I asked why they did not remove the broken chairs, they said, “no choice as we are still waiting for the new supply. The owner knows about it”  When I asked again if there was any one injured before, surprisingly yes there was… they rather prefer to get customers hurt.. just be careful… you can be the next person with bruise or even worse injuries."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHc1B1VWt3RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,Very yummy jjajang myeon and jjampong. The tang soo yuk and fried mandu were the best I've tasted in Singapore. Will definitely be back for more.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcXEzQmJREAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,Visited on a weekday night 8pm. Ordered the set for 2 pax with spicy fried chicken cubes. The chicken cubed was delightfully crisp yet tender to Bite into and were flavourful. The Jjampong noodle was brim-filled with seafood but atad more wok-hei for the soup broth would certainly have brought the overall taste a level higher. Jjajīang noodle was slurpy and gd to have nothing much to comment nor complain abt since nt much ingredients for this noodle. Overall liked the service and overall foodfare and reasonably priced for korean noodle place in sg. Total paid $60 for 2 pax that will probably feed 3 so will recommend if one is in the area and craves korean Chinese food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NWR2cURBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"The portion is super generous

The jampong soup is so delicious
The sweet sour chicken is on point

Waiters are very attentive to your needs

Will come back again to try the other dishes"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5X3BQcTdRRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"The jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles) and fried dumplings (tasted like curry puff) were not bad. From an earlier visit, enjoyed the 잡채 japchae (stir fried glass noodles and vegetables) and the 김치전 kimchijeon (kimchi pancake)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOUlXd1B3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,A great Korean Chinese restaurant that serves my favorite Jjampong and sweet and sour pork. I definately will be back to try this great Chinese food.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNzV1bWV3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"Chose the 2 pax set (actually can feed 3) which is what most people eat here. Priced at $53++. Honestly I’ve had better jjampong and jajangmyeon noodles (more Q and softer) in other korean restaurants thus wouldnt come back for the noodles though we love the spicy jjampong soup and the generous ingredients given.

Their sweet and sour pork is however a good huge portion and served hot from the kitchen which makes it even more tantalizing. Their fried dumplings are also crunchy and delicious.

The sides are pretty minimal (guess you leave more stomach space for the mains) but the kimchi is good.

Pretty cosy and small space that is family run and service is great. Complimentary water is served as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bkxXNHd3RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"Cosy little place serving nice korean food ! Very big portions and we can’t really finish our food. The staff were really friendly and would offer to split food into our bowls. Prices are on the higher side so while I would come back, I wouldn’t come back often. Music are a bit loud at times so could be hard to converse at times."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybHYzNk9BEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,1,"Been a while since we had usual gathering there till yesterday for the party of 10 Koreans who has abt 10yrs average life in Singapore.
Unlike previous experiences, there are big disappointments to all of us .
- service is really sluggish. Had to press buttons multiple times to get someone come to check.
- food is in general too salty. We asked less salty after tasting first two dishes, but it didn't work despite over 10 dishes we tried.
- Manager is seems having no customer caring attitude. She even turned back although we didn't finish our requests/orders.

We spent over $1.1K including the service charge of over $100 for this type of service and food.
All really got disappointed."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbGFPeUN3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Service (5/5): Good restaurant service. Prompt and welcoming. Has the standard korean small dishes and water, both refillable. Range of small dishes is not the largest, but good enough.

Food (5/5): We ordered the set A - 5 dumplings, sweet and sour pork, and choice 2x, either Jjajamyeon or Jjamppong. We got 2 Jjamppong.
The dumplings are nice, with vegetable and meat fillings, in particular, liked the sauce that comes with it. Reminds me of Xiao Long Baos.
The sweet and sour pork was great as well - the sauce was served at the side so that the pork remains crispy after some time. The sauce pairs very well with the pork.
I liked the soup of the jjamppong, and the seafood is quite plentiful. The noodles are normal to me, but the portion is huge.

Value (4.5/5): Price is not exactly cheap, but reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

Others: This isn't your trendy kpop kind of place, but rather relaxing, classy kind of place. One thing i picked up immediately when I entered was that they played instrumental music. Also, noticed there were quite a number of koreans in the shop.

Overall (5/5): Great food, reasonably priced. If you are in the location, worth a visit. I wouldn't mind going back for the same food, or try out new ones."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4bS1Ed0VBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"LOVE THE FOOD!! Set for 2 costs $53++. Can choose 2 bowls of noodles (jampong and/or jjm), tang su yuk and 5 dumplings. Idk where to begin....i rly love the food here.

The jampong was full of seafood flavour and lots of seafood given. About 4 or 5 mussels, prawn, octopus. Noodles were of great texture. The jjm was light and not jelat at all. Managed to finish the entire bowl.

The fried dumplings were crispy. The tang su yuk! It was served freshly fried. And even when it was cold thru the meal, the pork and batter did not turn hard. Finished it too!

Omg i feel like eating it now."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDaF9tRmZnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Surprisingly, the Korean Chinese fusion was pretty good. It is located next to the main road, which doesn't get it much attention as cars and human traffic just breezes by, until my friend recommended it to me. Their kimchi pancake is good. Their jja jang myeong is good. The jjamppong is good. Fried dumplings are alright. Sweet and sour chicken could be better, maybe pork would have been a better order. The soju and makggeoli just washed everything down well. Had a super full meal by the end of it all."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPZzV1VjdBRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"The food is AMAZING. Idk what’s it called, but yknw like zi char sweet & sour pork , they have it here but it taste SO DIFFERENT from the zi char kind. I had the ja jiang mian, the noodle is soooo good. Sorry I don’t rmb the names of the dishes 🙃 My friend said usually the place is crowded but that day I went was alright. Will definitely come back here!!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzeXNxMG93RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Had a lovely evening at this Korean Chinese restaurant with my friends. Food was amazing. One of the best 짬뽕 in Singapore. 탕수육 was savoury as well.

Do make a reservation as seats are limited"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTNVl5cUNBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,We found the BEST jjamppong here in SG! The broth was flavourful and generous portion! The noodles they used had nice textures! The tang su yuk was lacking in terms of the batter. Jjm was ok. I dabao jjm home and still not clumpy! Definitely coming back for the jjamppong!!!
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpeHRXOENBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,Best Sweet and Sour Beef (Tangsuyook) I had in Singapore! Love the sauce! Strongly recommend with Jjajangmyun! Great food. Fast service and cozy atmosphere. Recommended by a friend who said that this is one of the best Korean Chinese restaurants in Singapore.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaVozeFRREAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"First time here. Ordered jajangmyeon n Jjampong only as the 2 of us couldn't finish too much. Noodles are springy. Jajang sauce is just right, sweet but not overwhelming. Jjampong soup has alot of seafood freshness taste but as non spicy takers, we find it abit spicy but still find it very addictive. Overall, we considered them one of the best Jjampong n jajangmyeon in Singapore."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDMzZUN0dBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,3,"Saw the good reviews here and decided to try. But Honestly, I found the food very mediocre. I thought jjajang was alright, but I felt Dong Fang Hong was much nicer. The Jjambong was very very average tasting..

However, I agree that the noodles used for the Jjajang and Jjambong were very nice and chewy and it is their pride, despite the sauce and soup being pretty so so.

Tangsuyuk was alright? The pork was pretty tough and not really marinated thoroughly. Mandu was also average..

I think overall for $50++ for set A.. I think I rather patronise another stall based on taste of food alone. But service was good and quick."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeEk3ZjJBRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Good korean food near maxwell food center. Lots of koreans patronising this restaurant as well. Spent around $90++ for 5 people, price is decent for alacarte mains. They also provide the standard radish and kimchi side dishes. Overall good experience."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdTZIamN3EAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Cozy place with amazing decor. Easily located near Red Dot Design Museum, this is the place to go for authentic Korean-Chinese food! Came here with my friends recently and they are already asking to meet up there again! Special thumbs up for the 탕수육 (sweet and sour pork)!! Set meal which consists of jajangmyeon, jjamppong, tangsuyeok and mandu, is perfect for sharing! ^^ Will definitely be back again!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5NjlxMERREAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,"First time trying Korean Chinese food, so can't comment much.

I would say the food is 70% Korean and 30% Chinese."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdHNtUXd3RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Tangsuyuk, sweet and sour pork is the best. Come many times to try this dish."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMybFBtN1dBEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,1,"Would have given 0 star I could even do that. Horrible experience and service at the restaurant. Twice they messed my reservations and were not apologetic about it. Even though they might have seats, they would rather entertain walk in from Koreans, than offer the seats to us. We had a heavily pregnant diner in our group and all they can tell us is go stand elsewhere and not block them while they check what went wrong (which obviously was not solved). So if you are local, don’t bother to reserve because they won’t honor the reservation anyway, and will put the blame on you. Twice it was messed up by their Filipino staff Aida (sorry not sure how to spell her name so got to say her nationality but they only have 1 Filipino staff) so just be careful even if you still want to proceed to reserve. Make sure you check if it’s her, if yes, please ask for another staff to prevent yourself the agony of standing in the restaurant and getting maligned and blamed for their own staff mistake. Go at your own risk (of spoiling your plan and mood). Honestly, there are other better options just around with much friendlier staff and better service like Itaewon Jjajang, or even obba jjajang!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbWR2VHd3RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,Love their dumplings..their portion is rather generous and taste is good (not salty and oily). Service is prompt too.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHenNieEpnEAE,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,3,"Nothing really fantastic in my opinion. I tried Set A with fried dumpling, sweet sour pork, black bean sauce noodles and seafood soup noodles. Dumpling is quite tasty but overall I feel that the food is only average. Service is still good. Price is on the high side. Sweet sour pork smallest is $28. Wanted to try jelly fish salad but it’s $38. In my opinion only worth going once to try, unlikely to return again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTaFptNnB3RRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,5,"Delicious jjajang and jjampong. Everything was so good that we ordered another set for second round 🤩

The spicy seafood noodle soup (jjambong) and black bean paste noodle (jjajang myeon) is great. The noodle itself is chewy, taste as great as freshly handmade noodle! The jjambong soup is so flavourful, it just make me crave for more even I'm a person who can't really takes spicy food.

The tangsuyok also taste great. You can tell the greatness just by the smell of the fried pork! With the layer of sweet and sour source, it's just heavenly!

Definitely coming back for more!"

Even called in the afternoon to confirm and the staff confirmed my request. Only to receive a call later on from an impatient staff telling me that my request was not able to be catered for. I'm disappointed by your service, hwang sil. We were looking forward to enjoying Korean food with our Korean colleagues."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2MnNDUW1RRRAB,Hwang Sil Jjajang Jjampong specialty restaurant,4,Jjampong was delicious but a tad too spicy for me.  The spicy fried chicken taste ($35!) was good but the batter was a little too soggy for my liking.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXaHFpQUtREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"The food here is seriously excellent. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, nice Chinese meal. The caramelized eggplant is a must order. The wagyu steak was fantastic as well, very melt in your mouth. Dessert wise, I had the mixed tangyuan which was amazing. Service could be a little better, felt a little cold. Maybe it was just that day. Nonetheless I would still go back!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bWR1T3VnRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"An east-meets-west fusion restaurant at the Maxwell Chambers Suites.
The food looks simple but it is unique and delicious. Every private dining room is directly accessible from the passageway outside.
There is ample parking behind the building, though a little dark and quiet at night."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcnRpdGVnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,4,"Led by celebrity chef Heman Tan, Szechuan food is yummy and authentic. 辣子鸡was nicely cooked, not oily and spices and spicy level just nice. The eggplant was amazing nice, crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside, coated nicely caramelised."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteWUzd2ZnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,2,"Five of us had the Xmas menu. Pretty disappointing as the portions were quite small and food quality was so so. I used to like Xi Yan a lot but haven’t had a chance to go back since Covid. But I realised the quality and food portions has shrunk considerably. We are not big eaters but despite a 6 course lunch, we still felt like we were not full. Hope that they do improve but hard for me to revisit again for the quality at this price point."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNFpYY1pREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,3,"The food tastes good, but there wasn't the wow factor i was hoping for.  Service is attentive but standard. Place very cold, just feel like quickly leave the place after the meal. Prawns for peng cai do not taste well, manager said it could be overcooked n apologise for it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybFlLOURBEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,4,"Huge menu, very friendly service staffs and owners and lots of wine tasting events.

Food is good and experimental. Overall, a very friendly place."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNExlMjNBRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Another excellent meal here.
Service is efficient and friendly.
Reasonably priced."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOGFpSjRBRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,1,"Ordered the $108++/pax set dinner. Gone are its glory days when it's food is mind-blowing in terms of taste & creativity. To be fair, then it was still a private dining place, and it was more than 10 years ago. I was so wow that I went to the HK branch when I was over there.

Now it is just an ordinary restaurant dishing out boring fusion stuff. It's execution can be better as well. The only ok dish was the platter. The best is the soaked cherry. But this was an early creation since private dinning days, except that it has shrunk in size.  The rest of the dishes were so under-whelming. 1 star is for the food. One main reason was that the food tasted like a typical Chinese restaurant. Why would I pay so much to eat something so ordinary. Xi Yan 不再是昔日的 Xi Yan, 可惜可惜。

The service was good; attentive & friendly staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDM0tqa2VnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,3,"We are honored to be invited to a wine pairing dinner at Xi Yan by Wine List Asia.

The theme of the food for that night was Chinese food fusion with some Japanese elements. It went well with wine from Satori and we all had a insightful discussion on how each of the wine has its own unique characteristics and how versatile they were.

What I like about the restaurant is it’s interior decor and personal collection of porcelains, pottery and tea ware of the owner.w

We enjoyed the dinner with great company and good wine from Satori by Wine List Asia. The wines made the food enjoyable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXMXVETUdnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,4,I luv the Pao fan and vege..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cjl6ZjlBRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Best “yusheng lohei” I have ever tasted. 5 kinds of fish, octopus, ikura; with all organic vegetables & fruits complimented with special plum sauce that’s not too sweet & really refreshing on the palette. This dish alone is worth 5 stars ⭐️!
Signature fish soup with rice crackers was spot on too. A must try here.
Special chicken, Wagyu beef, Boston lobster noodle, dessert were all very good. Such an enjoyable dinner."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb19TS1d3EAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Great food at great value!
Attended a wine pairing dinner, superb!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDeWRLeDV3RRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,4,"Get the Blanched Red Grouper w Seafood Pepper Stock (Infused with Lobster, Prawns & Crabs). Topped with crackling crispy rice when it hits the soup. Skip the truffles and stick to the traditional Chinese dishes imo. A little on the pricier end for Chinese food but well worth the money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLanZxbnFBRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"I have been to Xi Yan more than 10 years ago at its own craig road branch and i never forget the experience. I like the way they make chinese cuisine fusion and yet did not lose the identify of the dish. So when i was deciding where to go to celebrate my family member birthday, i choose Xi Yan.

It was for a friday lunch and choices were between Xi Yan and other Hotels' chinese restaurants lunch menus. Xi Yan stood out immediately because it offers more variety and at a much affordable cost. Parking is also easy because Maxwell Chamber has its own car park. Car Park rebate comes with the dining.

The staff are very attentive and took very nice photos of us! Knowing how to take with right angle and background.

When i casually mentioned it was to celebrate birthday, they surprised us with the longevity bun!

It was still as good as 10 years ago and if not, it got better!"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteS1YaEZnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,3,"Service is impeccable. The cooking style for the food is interesting but IMO, no wow factor. Yu sheng is too fusion to my liking and having rocket leaves left a bitter taste to the yu sheng - not very appropriate considering this is supposed to be an auspicious dish? Can't say much about the white bee hoon as well - it is tasty but no wow factor. The grilled pork combi with the pineapple is refreshing though."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bVp6emhRRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,The food was tasty and the ambiance was privatize . We had our dinner here and its like a 'omakase' style .

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5NDU2Vml3RRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,1,"Very unpleasant experience dining here. We booked a table for Chinese New Year Eve for the first sitting at 530pm, for an 8 course meal. The first course arrived at 630pm and by 730pm we were only at our 4th course. The remainder of the 4 courses were rushed in the last 30mins and we finished dinner at 845pm. The second sitting started at 8pm and we were also asked to move our table to accommodate more guests. Food was average. Would not recommend this restaurant for any event, unless the aim is for a long and ardous meal with poor service. The restaurant should not take more reservations than they can manage."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjOV9uNENnEAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Due to the Covid-19 situation we tried their take-away menu and it was absolutely fantastic.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMHBqT0VREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Dinner last Sunday 27th Oct: Thank you Xi Yan Maxwell for a most memorable dinner and evening!
Fine dining restaurants can sometimes be snotty and not usually so relaxed or comfy, but at Xi Yan Maxwell other than the excellent modern Chinese food to rival some of the best on offer in Singapore (crab beehoon 10/10), it was also very well priced for an unforgettable dinner in a very relaxed yet trendy setting. My birthday party group of 33 were made to feel very special with good attentive service that was not overwhelming - no pushiness to buy drinks, although I must say the wines are so completely affordable compared to the much higher prices you pay elsewhere for the same. We were a bit noisy but with our separated dining area, I am sure nobody noticed. When the cake was brought in I could hear guests outside the open door clapping - the restaurant arranged a very impressive one. It is this homeliness that I like about Xi Yan. Thanks once again for taking great care of us. We will be back again and again."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5aUotclhREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,4,Food is pretty nice. Yu Sheng was refreshingly different...  fresh salad leaves and 3 types of raw fish instead of the preserved stuff. No shell fish to trigger allergic reactions..
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwak96TkRREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,1,Poor environment. The restaurant did not control what kind of liquor that the customers bring in. And allow the customers to drunk and make a lot of loud noises. Affecting the rest of the customers. The manager did not even do the job by controlling. This restaurant is poor to have your fine dining here. Look elsewhere if you want to have a good dinner.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVN2ZtUWhBRRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,"Arguably the best Chinese restaurant for foodies!! Amazing food; guaranteed to leave you and your guests satisfied and wanting to return for more.

So happy that Xi Yan has opened a new restaurant offering even more to please every diner. With the best of private dining favourites and improvised casual dining selection dishes, I was so impressed, I returned to the restaurant every week for the next 4 weeks.
To be fair, I have been a fan of Xiyan and I was delighted that with this new dining concept, I can  choose all dishes ala carte and not just Omakase - i personally prefer that accessibility.)

Here’s my die-die must try otherwise go back again list:
- Starters: Cold Okra, Century Egg Pitan Tofu and Signature Tomatoes
- Basil Wine Clams with korean glass noodles (my FAVOURITE dish. Clams preferred over the prawns since you get more from drinking the broth out of all the clam shells)
- Prawns: I’m torn between the ‘lighter’ Truffle Prawn with Egg White and more ‘exciting’ Kimchee cheese prawn
- Fish: Pomelo Fish (can never go wrong with this) and Garoupa slices with Crispy Rice in Broth (broth is amazing, a bit on the peppery side so if you have young kids, might want to ask them to go easy on pepper)
- Kagoshima Wagyu Beef  (I looooove the tangy green sauce)
- Dongbo Pork Belly Pyramid (my teenage nephews were all over this dish)
If it’s your first time there, try the Salivating Chicken. But I would try the others that are not on the casual dining menu first, especially if you have limited tummy space cos there’s really so much on the menu that needs to be gradually explored.
Once again, kudos to them, they manage to make every dish such a deliciously memorable experience."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5elp2SzB3RRAB,Xi Yan Maxwell,1,"Recently booked a lunch slot a week before the date and the slot was confirmed. Nothing else was mentioned by the booking staff and the staff also did not mention there were 2 sittings.
Two days before the lunch, i was told that my slot for lunch as 11am to 1230.
I think this is very out of ordinary for a weekday lunch and I think it should have been told when the booking is confirmed, and not days before the lunch."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTaGJ2UUZREAE,Xi Yan Maxwell,5,Awesome truffle chicken. One of the best Chinese restaurants to have a private wine dinner. My recent fave Chinese restaurant.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMDRUZ0hBEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,"If you like old school Chinese dumplings but don’t want to Din Tai Feng, there is always Jing Hua. The shop is well known for its so-called Chinese pizza (三鲜盒子). However, I would like to recommend that you try the pan fried dumplings (三鲜锅贴). You can see both in the pictures below. They also have a lot of frozen dumplings available for take-away, which is quite popular here. Of course they also have many of the usual suspects, but why not try something different? Service is fine and the price is reasonable. My only gripe would be that they do the usual Chinese restaurant scammy thing and charge for wet towels. To be fair, they’re probably more like 3.5 stars that four, but I’m not willing to round down to three here. The dumplings are pretty tasty and satisfying."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1N1BqQkpBEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,it was a very interesting place. I love the chinese pancake with meat in it. their fried rice was really good. you can notice the individual grain of rice. the dumplings were good. but the xiaolongbao was not good. the skin tear up easily and the broth just leaked all out. they should improve from there.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycUkyTnJ3RRAB,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,"Chinese pizza, steamed/ pan fried dumplings were all good! Zha jiang noodle was a peanut sauce instead of meat sauce so a tad sweet for my liking. No frills, small menu and consistent :)"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtdXM2c2tRRRAB,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,5,"A surprise find along Neil Road is Jing Hua Xiao Chi. After the huge disappointment previously at the nearby Maxwell Hawker Centre for Wo Tie (Pot Stickers), a find just 5 mins walk away managed to wash away that disappointment.

Opened in 1989, this local homegrown restaurant specialises in traditional Chinese Dumplings and other Chinese Appetisers. All the dishes and Dumplings are handmade and not factory prepared. Decided to order some takeaway food to sample their dishes.

The Pan-Fried Mixed Seafood & Pork Dumplings were exquisite. The skin was pan-fried and seared to have a light crunch while keeping the juices of the meat within. When paired with the vinegar and ginger strips, it was so good.

The other item ordered was the Chinese Pizza. Yes, the name is somewhat misleading. It is like a cross between a Pastry Pie and the Pork Dumplings. It was an interesting dish and just as enjoyable as the Pork Dumplings.

From the above, this restaurant is definitely a go to place for future cravings of Wo Tie (Pot Stickers).

General Verdict: Traditional Chinese Appetisers done well and done properly for a wonderful gastronomical experience

Opening Hours: Daily 11:30am-3pm and 5:30pm-9:30pm

Queue Situation: Next to none but seats within are generally filled

Price: SG$8.50 upwards

Payment Mode: Cash and all Major Credit Cards (Physical and Paywave)

Items Ordered:
1)
Item: Chinese Pizza 三鮮盒子
Description: Mixed Seafood and Pork Fillings in Pastry Skin. An interesting and enjoyable dish that is really yummy
Verdict: Very Good, Must Order
Price: SG$12++

2)
Item: Pan-fried Mixed Seafood & Pork Dumplings 三鮮鍋貼
Description: The skin was pan-fried and seared to have a light crunch while keeping the juices of the meat within. Pairs really well with the vinegar and ginger strips
Verdict: Very Good, Must Order
Price: SG$10++"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLTR1Q2NnEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,"Went there for dinner on a weekday night. The xiaolongbao was so-so and I don't think I would order that again.

However, the pan-fried dumplings (guo tie) were amazing! I would definitely order this again because of how juicy and tasty it was. I think I could actually finish a plate of it by myself! The guo tie is also different from the usual guo tie that I've tried from other places. It wasn't wrapped on both ends, so you have to quickly finish it in a few bites or just eat it in one shot, else the meat may slip out.

Other than these two dishes, we also ordered a bowl of noodles that seemed to be seasonal (I couldn't find the name on the menu). The pork was soft and flavourful, and the noodles were different from what I expected it to be. Usually, Chinese noodles are thinner, but the noodles that I had were thicker in size and were a bit like udon. The sauce was also on the sweeter side, and the noodles came with a huge serving of bean sprouts. Overall, this dish was not bad and the portion was alright. The food here is quite authentic and I enjoyed myself.

The staff were very fast in serving us. Also, it seems like this place is somewhat popular amongst tourists from Asian countries, because I heard quite a few people speak in Korean and Japanese."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOXJDTlZBEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,3,Dumplings and pancake was not too bad. The gyoza 🥟 is good. Do try the red bean pancake dessert which serve with good filling of good standard of tea beans paste.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bE1tSGJREAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,5,"I have chosen restaurants in Singapore to visit again when my son fly back to Singapore and this place is one of them. It is our third visit after being strongly recommended by my friend. It is not typical dim sum but I like all their dumplings. Especially the fried dumpling is the one that all our family members liked the best, while I picked their signature steamed dumpling and my husband picked the Chinese pizza.  It did not disappont me again. So happy to visit ther with my son."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaGF2a05nEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,3,"Decent food, small menu, and fast service.

Chinese pizza (9/10)
Savoury pastry pie with dumpling fillings. The crust was crunchy and super yummy, and their seafood, pork-spring onion filling was also packed with flavour. Would definitely order this again.

Steamed dumplings (7/10)
Wasn’t particularly tasty, not bad.

Zha Jiang Noodles (6/10)
Handmade doughy noodles coated with *sweet* peanut sauce. Imagine peanut butter + noodles. Noodles were overcooked (soggy) instead of al Dante. Dish felt more like a dessert."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa09LOElnEAE,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,"I used to patronize the branch at Bugis, which had closed for business. I am glad that they still have this shop operating. If you are driving, you need to park the public car park across the road or the Duxton area. l love the Chinese pizza and boiled or pan fried dumplings, coupled with vinegar and ginger strips. If you do have appetite for sweet dessert, you may consider their pan fried red bean or lotus paste pancakes."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2aWVtUnhBRRAB,Jing Hua Xiao Chi Singapore,4,"I ordered the xiao long bao, pan fried shrimp n meat dumplings, mala jajang noodles and the rosewater glutinous rice balls. Firstly the Xiao long bao, the skin on the top is on the thicker side and the meat filling was to mashy n the taste was off. The pan fried shrimp & meat dumplings was the star here! I can taste the well-marinated shrimp & meat, the skin was just the right thickness. The mala jajang noodles was so so.. noodles was a little too soggy for me and I would like it if more shredded cucumber was added to refresh the palate. I was surprised, they added fried tofu which was unusual but it was a great choice as they were really good; crispy outside and there were still bean curd left inside which was moist. The rosewater glutinous rice balls were also 👍 Right doneness of the balls w peanut n sesame fillings and it wasn't too sweet (maybe for those who like sweets will find it bland but it was just right for me). I find the standard has dropped since I last visited! 😜"
