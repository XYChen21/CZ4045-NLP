Until I had to the manager /supervisor then they serve our dish out . One of the kitchen server ( she 's not in uniform but white t shirt ) came out and saw our table is empty and said oh dear I will check for you with the kitchen.One of the fried dish wa cold when my folk bite on it , another dish wa the long bean and wa already very soggy ( `` old '' not my word , but the supervisor/manager 's ) At $ 46.80++ the menu is not extensive and some of the dish are not even though we again .

Here are the comment : Service - but no real customer attention . long and Sheng - not good the meat is too hard , like a meat ball , and not juicy enough . I do n't agree with one review that it is too oily . First the `` juice '' is not oil , it is pig skin boil long enough to become collagen so if anyone ha tiny little common sense will know these is good for skin and beauty . If you think it is oily then you better go eat . Here the skin is so thick and dry . The is not hot and bottom not crispy , just like toast . The pork not only hard but with no pork taste . Very disappointed , and if a restaurant will have signature dish disappointed , I can write off this restaurant . Curry beef rice vermicelli - surprisingly good and authentic and it give one star in my overall three star .

As for the food , I think they are missing the best point of a US or menu : You only have to stock 10-15 ingredient to make of different southern dish ! ! ! My suggestion , and I mean this with best intention . Offer plain everything in the menu , then make protein add-on . You are vegetarian by charging full price to remove the meat . Or even anyone that is n't in the mood for a particular protein . a surcharge to change protein is not cool . 2 buck extra to sub prawn for chicken is crazy .

Pan Fried Bun - bottom is definitely nice-crispy , dough to meat ratio is not that bad . My issue wa more how to consume it because I to drip vinegar inside + eat a a whole to enjoy the different texture . filling wa quite hot ( mine were fresh & hot , some review lukewarm food ) and I did n't want the soup inside to spill out so it wa a bit awkward trying to bite the bread part open and cool the inside down . After which it wa still slightly too big to stuff the whole thing in my mouth .

BY COMPARISON , this one is , slightly bigger ( I say so because I usually put the whole in my mouth ) but like a rougher made cousin , skin is not a thin and tender which of lesser skill from the maker , meat is also `` exquisite '' .

"The mala here is definitely one of the best and one I have had . They offer ingredient that one would normally not find in other mala stall but still manage to blend them seamlessly into the dish . I would highly recommend the egg , which they serve on top of the dish . Another unique point would be how they deep-fry certain ingredient ( best of which are the potato , lotus root , and fish ) which add an extra layer of texture and taste . I find the dry version to be the better style of their mala , but this is not to discount the soup version , which is rather a well . Though do expect to wait around 15 - 25 minute , which feel rather acceptable to me considering the level of preparation . The price is based off the weight of the ingredient , irregardless of whether they are meat or vegetable . to other mala stall , the price here is considerably and you can expect to spend around S $ 8 - 10 per person for a filling portion . The store ha a great ambience a well with a cozy indoor setting and also a cool outdoor seating a part of the campus . Some seat to wait at is also provided along the corridor to the store which is an added bonus . I end with their service , which is mainly what me to write this review . The staff there have always been friendly and helpful in all my visit . I would like to highlight a recent visit when they unfortunately made a mistake in the order . As we only later when the store wa about to close , we were not able to ask for the missing ingredient . However , my friend wa by an employee of the store who wa very apologetic and a discount off our next order . The responsibility and service shown by the staff through this action definitely the consistency in their service . All in all , definitely worth the trip into !",1.0,0.9997664093971252

"D is a well known chain of restaurant . However , the mo branch is quite poor intern or food variety and service . After month of renovation , the restaurant wa finally .

Even though there were 4-5 people in the kitchen , I that many order were and given wrongly to other customer . Thankfully , mine wa not . However , I that the supervisor ( who wa also the supervisor of the previous shop there ) wa very demanding with the worker though they were trying hard . His constant nagging did n't help . The food is over priced weighed with the quality given . For a mutton meal , the shop worker whether I and I said . In a typical food store ( even in restaurant ) , is not but here I wa $ 1 , I only got to know it when I at the receipt on my way back . If it is , they should at least tell .

"Writing this make me really upset because i wa here yesterday to celebrate my 's birthday . This place is an absolute disappointment and ha horrendous customer service . First off , for a reservation for 20 pax at 830pm because people are coming from work and hence the late timing . However , the staff on the phone kept and being so with me by telling me that I should come because the last order wa at 930pm . Not only that , they do not respect my boundary a they to confirm my table by calling me 5 time while i am at work . Then , to get everyone to come and the waitress wa so towards the item we want to order by saying we should get abalone dish . However , not everyone like to eat such dish because we have people that are not local and which doe n't suit their taste . But the staff wa super insistent about it which , once again be professional . You guy are a star restaurant . The worse of all , dish came out so fast that every time each waitress come , 4 dish come out at the same time . You got to pace the food timing because if you rushed all the dish out , the other dish are going to be cold and it affect the texture , taste and quality of the food . Then , staff still that they have no control over this . , you obviously can just tell the chef at the back to slow down with the food . I know you want to faster get your job done and close the shop early but we are here and we arent that unreasonable to stay till late night . Also , We are approximately close to 10 dish for each table and food got to be at a moderate pace . Worse of all , staff even went to argue and retaliate against our request . Is this even reasonable ? To end off , my family have been spending at least hundred of dollar every visit when we come to because we find that food is decent , a nice location to be and also a place my family can bond together .

"Reasonably price food , large portion with slightly above average flavour . I ordered fried rice , Kai Lan with salted fish and pork fried with basil . I find the fried rice lack flavour instead it tasted more like tomato fried rice . The kan lan with salted fish seem to have stir-fry both ingredient separately and mix them together at the final stage . Best is the pork with basil , a bit spicy but it wa good .",1.0,0.5249672532081604

"Ordered a dish that came with free mushroom soup ... except that they did n't even have mushroom soup . The cashier said they would compensate me with more fry and salad .

Eventually the food came , chicken wa though the sauce wa good , overall I felt it wa n't worth the $ 7.5 though , I 'd skip this and go straight for the $ 1.3 dim sum ... there 's some serious competition at this place and there 's no excuse for advertising a free food item that is n't ready ... how strange .

"I don ‚Äô t understand how this restaurant clocked 4.1 based on review . Neither the food or service is worth that much . Came with 2 young in tow for lunch after a zoo outing .

Let ‚Äô s take this a an oversight from the staff and move on . The young server the dish to another waitress in bob hair and the situation . The bob hair waitress decided she need to investigate the situation and brought another 2 colleague along to discus . So , we had 3 person standing at our table while we were trying to have a meal . I find this behaviour to be unacceptable at a restaurant . Even busy have better service standard . The staff then tried noisily to sort it out with the kitchen which wa situated 1 table away from u and by a folding screen . I ‚Äô t take it and feedback to the staff to sort out the issue quietly . The staff ‚Äô t able to understand my comment and brought back the bob hair waitress .

She took the comment away and brought some colleague to the folding screen to ‚Äò talk ‚Äô about my comment . The folding screen block view , not noise . I can hear everything that wa being .

To be fair , the younger staff were diligent in plate , taking order and serving customer . If the restaurant want to do better , more attention need to to it customer service level .

While can feed on non Halal , we are other of their food when they sold u their serving . In any case , I leave it to your , I did had experience when the same guy ordered the exact same thing in front of me , and i did got at least $ 2 more to his plate of Nasi at Che Rose . But I do n't take it against them . There 's only so many piece of their delicious Fried Chicken and they do get sold out usually mid lunch peak . In any case , I am back here today at 1230pm , all I love are in stock ( except drumstick ) and I am game to eat . The short queue in front of me are all diner . . My order $ 11 . All my since I wa a . Fried chicken , Beef , , fried egg , mixed cabbage on rice topped with their curry chicken sauce and sambal . Some might think $ 11 for this is horrendous . I think it fair . I knew their Beef and Chicken are daily . How I knew ? Cos I used to know a relative whom their beef fresh daily from Market . He had since retired but vendor he knew took over . Fresh supply daily is not cheap in a stall quantity . That 's quality food . And for the same quality if you eat the same in a restaurant , trust me you will be paying way more than $ 11 . Tender and , crispy and juicy fried chicken , freshness you can taste . Their Nasi and sambal is of a very local style . A familiar taste we grow up with . Now the pair of sister took over from Auntie Rose . Still you can see Auntie Rose seating at the stall with a watchful eye . Quality and flavour totally the same from when I first had them 4 decade ago . I will definitely come back for more .",0.0,0.8609809279441833

Service - I wa disappointed with the lack of attention to our table and the very slow drip of replenishment food which we had ordered through the . Initial round of meat and other condiment barely covered the amount of people we had in our table which in each person only a piece of meat before running out . We had to order again through the system and more than 20 min for them to actually give u more food . Regrettably this only after I had to literally chase down a staff at the other end of the place and complain.By the way I do n't blame the staff for the restaurant being clearly short handed . the quality given wa average at best which did not match the price for a buffet . For reference per head we were 35++ per adult not inclusive of an additional optional charge of SGD4.90 ++ for free flow drink / dessert . For that price in comparison would have prawn to be available but this wa only available if you add a further charge for premium meat/seafood . which would have brought the price up per head to 50++.You could get a buffet with oyster / prawn at a hotel at that price .

"We ordered the Rice , curry fish head , Noodle , San Noodle , and salted egg bitter gourd . The Rice wa really nothing impressive . There have been other Rice which are much better than this place . Especially for the price tag , totally not worth it . However , the other dish were very good . San Noodle and Noodle wa good . Curry fish head wa also spicy and also filling . That being said , the very off thing about this place is that after you order , before you eat , you have to pay up . I did not mind the first time before starting to eat , but during our meal , when we ordered additional drink , it wa really off and a hassle .

"The last time I Buddy , the chicken wa dry and hard . The rib tasted like it wa left from the previous night , very dry . That wa almost two year ago , if I remember right . I gave it another shot today . I head inside the restaurant half the chicken being dry and hard again . I wa by friendly staff . Nice . I ordered the mixed grill that come with a sausage , chicken and pork , with coleslaw and onion ring . The set came with a drink and either a mushroom soup or soup . I chose the former . The mushroom soup tasted bland . It ‚Äô s white in colour . I do not know if it ‚Äô s supposed to be that white . They serve a slice of soft bread with garlic spread . Nothing fancy . The main course came before I could finish my soup . Fast . Too fast . I ‚Äô m fine with it since I did not like the soup . This time round the chicken wa moist . Thank goodness for that . The pork wa smaller in size but tasted moist too . The coleslaw wa not heavy on the sauce . Maybe if they give you a small wedge of lemon for your coleslaw would be nice . Anyway the onion ring were cold . If felt like the cook had made a basket of it and just left it there till someone order it . Should have ordered the hot instead .

But this is the that I 've seen of the today ( I Four Toa , and Dove today ) . , which is disappointing . Red bean : ahem if I want Penang , I would be looking for those delightfully soft - and sweet ! - kidney bean which I first tasted at Penang ( and have n't found anywhere else since ) . You get a reasonable quantity of bean ... But you should expect that , at $ 2.5 , the most expensive of the so far today . Overall : nothing really strike me about this . It 's middle of the road a far a I 'm concerned ... Or maybe I 've taken too much for today . I do n't think so though . The gula is n't generous , but you do get bit of it . The nice thing about it is it to come by default with * two * metal spoon , so in case you 're , you do n't need to ask to one more . And the spoon are metal .

On service , the staff wa very patient in explaining to me the difference between the 3 type of grilled chicken , and took the trouble to double confirm my order . Speaking of food quality , this is so far the best grilled chicken I had in Singapore.The outside is a bit and crispy , while the inside is tender and juicy.When you try to extract the flesh , it come off easily.Only priced at $ 4.50 ( for chicken only ) , which is very reasonable , considering the effort put in and the quality . The Nasi wa full of coconut flavor.Not the typical type you find here , which only ha a hint of coconut flavor.It is comparable to Boon Lay Power Nasi , which in my opinion is one of the best in . It wa well worth my effort up all the way just to try it.But what really me to give the stall a try wa the owner 's sincere gesture in handling the complaint made by a customer . We usually see owner or customer service officer with an apology , which is all.But this stall owner wa willing to offer the customer a free meal , I think action than word and I applaud such an act .

"Let 's be fair and honest , the food quality ha due to the inflation and the spike of food cost , I can accept it , the most is visit lesser since there are other alternative around the corner , that 's not my main focus today . Something I want to highlight and can not tolerate with , is the attitude of the staff at city square mall . I am a regular customer of Fei Group . I always patrol their stall at different place all over , specially Tan at , at Hub and Point , Nam at Grandstand and Plaza and at point , all the staff I have met never show any attitude problem so far except the branch at City Square Mall . I have had a few incident prior to my today . It wa a very unpleasant experience and affected my mood each time . The staff I would like to bring to the attention is the staff in charge of rice/Bak , this man is always very rude and impatient while serving customer . The other one is the staff the noodle and ban mian , skinny male who simply my special order and showing sign of attitude . This wa what had , I discovered that I wa paying $ 0.90 for my , hence why not $ 0.60 . after knowing that per container , I decided not to separate my noodle from the soup . He wa a bit unhappy but the $ 0.30 . What made me feeling wa my curry noodle wa ready , but he told me the ban mian would n't be ready so fast but have to wait , fineüôÑ . So I stood aside , while waiting , I only saw one customer collected the wanton noodle , no one else . Next one wa my turn , question is , why would he want to delay my ban mian ?

Place wa 20 % full and what ‚Äô s the issue with u shifting to a bigger table when the small table wa not enough to accommodate our food comfortably ? It wa Sat evening but still early at 6pm . When we left at around 7pm , there were still 2-3 empty big table . It ‚Äô s a turn off when these can ‚Äô t even display some proper service and had to argue with the customer over such petty stuff . That auntie wa sarcastic too and said we to change the table a few time , that wa due to her poor and comprehension that the first table near to entrance had hot and cold air alternation whenever the front door is being and we to shift inside to another table ( also 4-seater which she and for u to move to a 2-seater ) . After sitting down it felt too small a the set of two bowl of noodle and a big plate . The neighboring table ( 4-seater ) also had 2 customer seated there either similar thing or lesser . So why the fuss about the move in order to ‚Äú reserve ‚Äù it for bigger group ?",1.0,0.6905129551887512

"Summary : For the price-to-quality and long wait , go somewhere else . The good : The food wa of decent quality and the shrimp chee fun had quite a lot of prawn in it . The average price of each dish is about $ 3.50 , which is par for the course at a dim sum experience . The bad : Despite the price , it is n't a full dim sum experience never it is n't a restaurant , but charge the same price . The operation are up with a lot of inefficiency , leading to the customer their food in bit and piece ( you need to collect it yourself - again than a dim restaurant experience , where they deliver to your table ) and the wait can be very long , depending on the dish - I had to wait for about an hour for the freshly fried red bean pancake ! By then I wa n't hungry and lost eating momentum - I would have rather they did n't offer it at all if I knew I had to wait that long .",0.0,0.9855506420135498

"1 is 4sgd . Will you buy ? ? ? Simply not worth it . Honest opinion , the food taste for the curry , mutton , and chicken chicken gravy are really good . However when it come to the stuff , it is tasteless . Basically and over priced . I do buy their food once or twice a month , a much a I to avoid getting food from there , for some reason ... i helpless at time due to time constraint and it is the only shop available at my area . They do n't have everything which is listed in the menu . I usually do n't dine in , a I stay nearby . But that particularly day I decided to dine in and Ordered the impossible Rogan Josh and a plain . I 20mins with the to eat it with the plant base rogan josh . I 'm not exaggerating with the timing . I finished my tea waiting for the Rogan josh gravy , I received a plate of impossible 20mins later , And the staff insist that it wa what I ordered , then when checked at the cashier , they still kept my order which I wrote with the pencil on the order pad they provided . Found out that the lady ( new staff ) keyed in my order wrongly , sadly No apology extended .. A short guy with medium length hair , who i been there with for long from covid , . He ask the lady very angrily about the order and show unhappiness even before I say something .. Honestly I wa n't even when I had to wait 20min for the gravy , but what piss me off wa , when he me that they do n't have the impossible Rogan Josh With his stern face he whether I still want the or not .. I him that wa not what I ordered .. He said no problem , and start to process the refund and the lady at cashier keep to him . I wa Worried the new lady staff at cashier would be in trouble for this incident and I told this guy I will just take away that since they already prepared . I him to pack it . I also Him For some fish curry for my cold . He immediately it to me . There wa no thank You or sorry which is what in these service staff . I remember that I even Him by moving myself to another table when he me , since there wa a big group came later than me , Who the table to be combined . Anyway this wa n't the only reason why I end up in Review , but It is mainly because I often hear my mum that these worker are very rude .. And sometimes intentionally talking unhappily and sarcastically whenever my mum is there to get her food for work , which is very disturbing while waiting there .

The duck wa the purpose of this trip and it doe not disappoint , crunchy and thin skin pair with the soft and meat , simplify delightful . My wife love the , it is a very small portion and quite salty therefore I would recommend that you pair the fish with some rice . We also ordered the Freshly Peeled Fried Rice , with the price , I wa more crab meat but nonetheless , it taste awesome . You can eat the fried rice just on it own ( without any side dish ) .

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank your staff ( 90787 Lee Yoke ) of the branch . We knew the crowd on a ( 15th May 2022 ) and we expect for a while for a table of 10 pax for our 1st family dinner in 2 year . After in the queue for 30 min , Lee received u at front of the queue . She informed u that we will need to wait for around 1 hour plus a the restaurant had only 2 room with table that could accommodate 10 pax . She wa very polite and even for the long waiting time , a there wa another family of 10 of u waiting for a table .

"Been a regular there a food is good at the place . But , there are important thing to improve on ( especially lately ) . Have been there since pre-covid , it ‚Äô s a simple cozy place . Food is affordable , taste authentic and very delicious , always going there . But recently , it ha been disappointing on more than 1 occasion . On all of these occasion , it ‚Äô s the same problem - service . Somehow they hired someone new ( note : the last time we went , she ‚Äô s not new . She should have been working there for close to half a year already ) . This specific staff always got our order wrongly , either forgetting one of the dish that we ordered , serving dish first to those that came in later or once even , serving our dish to the wrong table . The people from the table were unaware and touched our bowl . When we pointed that out to the respective staff , she took the bowl from them and it directly to u . In a situation like this ( especially when it ‚Äô s covid period ) , ‚Äô t she change the bowl to a new one before serving it to u ? It ‚Äô s basic hygiene standard . And when we pointed out that we were not comfortable with eating from the bowl that other people have touched it already , she and the kitchen staff shouting back and forth in language in front of u . And the kitchen staff even the table at the counter more than once while shouting or . At certain point , even glaring at u . As if it ‚Äô s our mistake . Ever since then , I have never felt comfortable going back again . I really hope they improve on this staff issue . It ‚Äô s such a waste when their food is really good . Just a note , I have tried giving chance and returned to the store after I the drop in their service . But it just get worse every time . We also around near 8pm when crowd is . This ‚Äô t happen when it wa busy . And no , I do not expect very good or impressive service .

"Here is my honest review useful to you : I for the first time with much apprehension . I read the recent review of this place , and wa quite afraid that the bad review were true . I felt uncertain but decided to take the risk at the end . I booked in advance for a table , and I pre-ordered the famous Sheng ( basically Long but fried ) . I the shop to a welcoming . Seated , and at the menu . The menu is very limited especially for a China mainland-hailing restaurant . These type have very large menu . This is my opinion regarding the limited menu . I actually like it because it towards quality dining , fine dining . What do I mean ? Simple , the harder it is to make dish , the more effort it take , the smaller the menu by the chef . . So , I hope none of you ugly customer them for this point . Menu is limited , but so what ? Every dish is lovingly made . Many dish are handmade . I ordered quite a number of different dish . Probably about 25 % of the entire menu . Here is my general comment on the food . How wa it ? Excellent . Excellent . Excellent . The noodle were handmade , and no , I am not just telling you it is handmade just because the menu say so . I can see and taste that the noodle are handmade . The shape , the non-uniformness , the springiness , the body , the texture . Handmade noodle . The vegetable were simply in fragrant oil . Excellent . Definitely novel to the usual `` Kai Lan '' or `` Spinach in Oyster Sauce '' in stalls/chinese restaurant . The Long wa good enough to rival Din Tai . But the main star of the show wa the Sheng . I will not go into detail . All I will say is that it had taste and bite to it . It is n't just long wrapped in a different-shaped . It is more than that . A in it own right . The red bean bun dessert wa a very good finisher to an excellent meal . Sweet but not too sweet . Very chewy bun . I may not have every dish to you , but I want to end off by telling you that from what I have tried , I can tell that this is a quality over quantity place . Some commentator complain that the portion are too small . I say this : the price are small too . Definitely than eating dim sum in expensive hotel restaurant . If you think the portion is small , order more than 1 serving . Very simple . Very , very simple . There is quality in their dish . Handmade noodle and handmade require a lot of labour effort , labour hour . You think they buy their skin from a distributor then wrap meat inside ? Of course they have to knead the dough , flatten it , cut it into small circle , and wrap meat and inside . Wake up , . You expect to pay cheaply for a lot of ? Some commentator complain that the service is slow . I say this : it is run by a very slim crew . Their food is quality . You expect crazy , big-chain , 20-man kitchen to churn out your food ? The consolation is that they serve your dish once or twice every 10mins . So it is actually . It take a long while for every dish to come out , but at least it keep coming . They dont do one table by one table from what I . Some commentator complain that the show . I say this : You dont ? I thought most of you are too ? `` Ka '' ? `` Guan Xi '' ? So what if the like to chat with regular , and laugh with them ? So what ? Finally , they serve free flow chrysanthemum tea . You can see the yellow flower petal in the jar to you . Amazing . Yes , the best restaurant I have gone to . I think of the expensive , grand restaurant .... you know what ? They 're different . Hard to compare . But this place doesnt lose out on taste at all . Not at all . I wish them the best . I can tell they just want a humble , simple , quite life in this enclave . As for you , make sure you call well in advance to book your table and your Sheng . Simple . Ignore all the rubbish comment here from ugly . Call , book , then , go , and eat . Very simple .",0.0,0.5337554812431335

The wa towards the saltier side , but I really like the flavor . I would have given a higher rating if the pork wa more tender . But some people like it that way . The chicken wa nicely done .

The drink came rather quickly and then soon most of the other being up . They also provide curry a seen in the picture for free . If you want sugar with your you can also ask them to a bottle to you . In essence service here is pretty good even though they are extremely busy . The onion cheese and the egg wa excellent . Super crispy and tasty a well . Would highly recommend ! The plaster wa quite to me and the dessert is similar to the red bean pancake you have in restaurant except it much and also the red bean is not a fine and fragrant . I would give this a miss the next time . is ok. Big cup is sizeable but because we make our own at home we prefer it more with more carnation milk and syrup . This wa a tad bit diluted for me . By the time we our entire meal plus drink our coin had not been . Not only ours but the table close to u a well . We thought good thing are worth the wait ... right ? Wrong ! We totally the coin and ended up not finishing it . It wa so thick and so much flour even though it wa crispy it wa just too floury for our liking . Will we come back ? Definitely !

"noodle , or Rebus is a comfort food since childhood growing up in 's heartland . And in the heartland of is this food stall of more than 4 decade 's history moving from location to location over the year . On offering is a few basic dish only , from 230pm , and of course Rebus their specialty . Menu start from $ 3.50 , $ 4.50 Power Rebus or $ 6 Extra Special . In general , Rebus is a yellow noodle dish , and most place offer them with bean sprout , fried , green and hard boiled egg , topped with fried shallot . The star is always the thick , sweet potato sauce with rich . Different stall us different base from mutton , beef , chicken , dried shrimp , to even swimming crab a soup base of the sauce . Some ha strong taste , some rich while some watery , and mostly too sweet . Hence at 's their rich and thick sauce ha the right consistency , not too starchy and not too sweet . Enough to coat the sauce , an unique to this stall , top with a coat of peanut sauce . And on the side , if you like it spicy , black and ketchup to add depth to the flavour . Enough sauce to coat the chewy noodle nicely , and add a whole lime to give the broth a tangy twist . The Power version get you boiled chicken slice , and the extra special get you a whole chicken leg . The chicken is nicely marinated , juicy and to the right texture . Enough to bite chunk off the chicken meat , and tender . Bean sprout and provide crunch to the dish , and my only gripe is missing fried shallot or would have made this 5/5 .",1.0,0.9986685514450073

'' Both dish when ordered together is $ 43.80 Both dish are nice . The soup is not too salty and I half the portion since I ca n't finish it alone even without rice . The Spicy Fried is actually a stir fried dish . I decided to remove all shell before eating with the sweet garlic spring onion . To me , it is n't spicy at all , tasted just like a little light sprinkling of pepper . The chrysanthemum tea ( $ 3.80 ) is non-sweeten and refillable . I like it that they do n't add sugar to it . Overall , I had a quiet lunch a I went in before noon . The staff were polite and able to advise me on my selection how the clam should be a they have 9 way of it . The food tasted good without making me very thirsty afterwards . Be prepared to pay a little more for better quality food . I $ 65.45 for my lunch today .

"Super disappointed by the tamarind prawn soup with vegetable ( item 18A ) . For $ 15.90++ , it had two tiny measly prawn . were cabbage , broccoli and carrot - which were too raw .

The scallion oil noodle had too little scallion taste a the noodle wa a disproportionately large serving .
