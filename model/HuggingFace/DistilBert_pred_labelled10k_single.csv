It wa a horrendous first dining experience at this notably renowned venue for cuisine Regrettably I should have known from the quality in review From the start we had made a reservation via phone call for 9 person but we were shown to a table for 8 person 71 When we about that the lady serving u had no answer and basically just that it  ’ s they would add one more seat to a smaller looking table It wa strange but I thought nothing of it until almost towards the end of the meal when we were again whether they could serve mixed fruit platter That wa when it hit me that they had mixed u up with another bunch of guest Despite repeated complaint none of the staff sincerely apologetic and merely wa in a rush to turn over the table for the second round of diner Apart from that the quality of food tonight wa not outstanding and service wa rushed and nobody plate or pouring tea till we for it The pomfret to be not well there wa redness and toughness in some part of the meat It is definitely not a place worth the premium for food service decoration or anything at all Atmosphere wise the place wa noisy and warm with spot light all over and little It wa supposed to be a nice welcoming dinner for our guest but tonight it wa nothing short of a disaster with the premium for dinner total damage bill being more than 500 dollar Consider seriously if you really want to come to dine unless you really have the cash to spare or prefer to take photo of the food presentation Note there wa no service recovery done at all,0.0,0.9986321330070496
